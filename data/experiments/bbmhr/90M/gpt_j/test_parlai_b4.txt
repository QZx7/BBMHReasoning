text:Hi, how are you doing?\nHi, I'm ok. How are you? The seeker and supporter are chatting. The supporter should look for ways to help the seeker.	labels:Not bad, it's a peaceful night. Anything in particular you'd like to talk about?
text:That's great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing. The seeker is feeling lonely, but she has someone around her to talk to. In this conversation, the supporter should ask the seeker questions about her work and the reason why she is feeling lonely.	labels:I imagine that's very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well-being?
text:Just to make sure I'm wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions. The seeker feels stressed and overwhelmed. The supporter can ask the seeker more about the job situation.	labels:I'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It's scary for everyone at this point.
text:Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist.. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should try to tell the seeker to focus on the things that she can control.	labels:It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration..
text:I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I'm forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can't quit because there not much to go into now. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should listen to the seeker and try to be supportive.	labels:Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with?. Yeah you're right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could've never prepared for.
text:I've tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her relationship. The supporter should help the seeker feel that there is someone around her that loves and cares about her.	labels:I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying.
text:Very true. I'm going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better. The seeker feels lonely and stressed, but the supporter provides useful advice and gives some conversation instructions.	labels:Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some.

The supporter could ask the seeker the reason of her stress, which also could cause the supporter to feel stressed.	labels:It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.
text:Yeah thats really the reason I wanted to go away from college. I dont really have my own space when I'm here. People just come in and out of my room as they please in spite of how busy I am. The seeker feels like she cant focus at school because she feels like she is not alone in her room. The supporter could help the seeker by telling her that she is not alone at school and she can count on people to lend an ear if she needs to.	labels:Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries. I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh. Have you told your family about the issues your having?
text:I honestly am worried that they will be disappointed. Maybe that's crazy. I just remember how proud they were when I got this scholarship. I don't want them to blame me. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter can suggest that the seeker focus on the things that she does have instead of the things that she does not have.	labels:OK, that makes sense. Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers.
text:Yeeah thats why im not officially failed. My teacher gave me an extention on my final. So, I'm working on it, but i just can't focus. The seeker is worried about her scholarship and is struggling to get herself focused when she is home. Her supporter can make her feel that she has people around her and can help her focus on her schoolwork.	labels:Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself. Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.	episode_done:True
text:Hello how can I help you?\nKind of mad. The seeker feels mad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:May I ask the reason why you are mad?

text:Intentional. First it started from one person cuz my friend put me on speaker about something. and apparently I said something that made one person mad. I was on a PHONE CALL. The seeker is mad that her friends are intentionally putting her down. The supporter should ask for more.	labels:Did you say anything offensive?
text:Kind of. My friend asked what is up and my girlfriend of course was nosey and said bad cuz my mom is harassing us. I was saying my mom has been ripping me off and keeps threatening to kick me out. So I just said. I honestly am at the point where I don't care if she is around or not. So someone reported me for some bs thing on playstation cuz they think I must be trash if I don't love my mom or something. The seeker feels lonely and mad. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I see.  If that is the case, create a personal meeting with you and your friends (the ones who banned you)..
text:My mom is kind of a draining person. I thought of being around because she has been going through low hemoglobin. But she keeps ruining my life. I wish I could. I don't even know  the jerk. The rest of them then did it because they don't like my girlfriend. The seeker feels mad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to consider the situation with her friends and to avoid getting angry in the future.	labels:just to clarify, are these online friends?  Have you met them in person?
text:Online friends. I only know one. the one who was on the phone with me. he just can't keep a call private for anything. The seeker tells about her mother not giving her any love, and how she feels like she doesn't have a friend to talk to. The supporter asks the seeker if she can meet her friends and why she is mad.	labels:and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally?
text:Even my nephew who plays with those jerks was avoiding me because my girlfriend. yeah... So... my girlfriend has this condition and was in a hospital for high contamination in her blood from her bad liver. So she was talking weird. and everyone was calling her annoying. The seeker feels lonely and upset. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk about her mom and her friends. Then ask her to focus on what she does have.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that..
text:But those insensentive morons don't care she literally almost died. Instead, everyone just keeps asking why am I with this disabled girl. Like... she is better now. She just needed to recover. People I knew for four years... going out of their way to mess with me. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should let the seeker know that she has friends around her; some of them are online but she has met them personally in person. The supporter can tell the seeker that she can create a conversation for her.	labels:The best advice I can give you is to try to get your friends together on a private group call.  Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation.. However, if they do not respect your response, then they can't really be relied on as your friends.  They don't come to respect you so it is best for you to move on..
text:Yeah. I mostly tried to stay to my myself. Right now they're mad at me because they got all warnings from Sony. since they did an investigation on how everyone speaks. The seeker feels lonely, sad, angry, and frustrated. With this conversation, the supporter is able to understand the reason that the seeker is feeling those emotions. The supporter then gives some conversation instructions to the seeker.	labels:Nobody should demoralize another person and that is what your "online friends" are taking advantage of..
text:Even my own sister is giving me crap because my nephew almost lost thousands worth of games. The seeker feels lonely and sad, and the supporter could let the seeker know that there is a lot of people around her to love and support.	labels:Also send a report to Sony about the ban.  I believe with the proof, they can appeal the ban for you!
text:cuz of the warning... Like I can control what these people do when I'm offline. I did... they said they can't do anything. and that I can just report them. Kind of sucks but I guess I will just stick my lane. Karma already banned someone in the group. took $2000 worth of games. so that gave me a good laugh.

In this conversation, the seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend.

text:Well my friend just said it's my fault for buying ourselves game on his account. The seeker feels angry, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:He clearly does not respect you so you need to set up some discipline and ground rules..
text:that prick. For now... I am just left on my own. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could point out that the seeker has a lot of people around her. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker needs to stop being so dependent on others.	labels:Honestly, he's your nephew.  So the fault lies on his parents..
text:Maybe so. I think he'll get around. The seeker s nephew is the one who is mad at her. The supporter should have told the seeker to tell her nephew to stop being mad at her. Instead the supporter told the seeker to set up some rules with her nephew.	labels:But I really do hope you get your account back.  I'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend..
text:Yeah. She started thinking all of my friends are like that but she figured out I have some good ones. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has friends around her that she can lean on.	labels:And I hope my advice/suggestions have been helpful!
text:It was thank you very much. The seeker feels lonely, is sad and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the friend/s are not as good as the supporter thinks they are.	labels:You're very welcome!  If that is all you have for me now, you can end the conversation.

text:Exactly right, after 15 years and 4 kids, he cheated on me and the affair produced a child. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is. Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?
text:At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids. The seeker feels lonely and angry, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.
text:The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it. The seeker is struggling with ending a long term relationship. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone in this type of issue.	labels:I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.
text:I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?! The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask her to elaborate more about the situation.	labels:Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.
text:Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do? The seeker feels lonely and feels like the kids don't understand what she is going through. The supporter should help the seeker to see that the kids are on her side and help them see how she is feeling. The supporter should ask her how she felt and what she would like to try and do about it and try to help her have a positive mindset.	labels:This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.
text:I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point. The seeker feels lonely and sad about ending the relationship with her child's father. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not the reason that she is feeling lonely. She could also tell the seeker that there is still hope for things to get better.	labels:I think that would definitely help! What are some things you like to do?
text:How do I deal with my feelings of disgust? I like to color, I like to read, I like to do puzzles. The seeker feels disgusted, but the supporter should ask her to talk about the situation.	labels:You have to know that it wasn't your fault. He was the one who was unfaithful and there is nothing that you did to cause that. This was something I had to keep telling myself as I was trying to process everything. Sometimes it isn't easy, but you are your own biggest supporter. It wasn't your fault.

The supporter should tell the seeker that she has friends around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Thank you. Anything else I could help you with?

text:Hello there.\nHello. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Is there something you want to discuss?
text:yes. My birthday's coming up and I feel a lot of self-hatred for what I've failed to accomplish by this age. The seeker expresses her self-hatred over not accomplishing her goals. The supporter could encourage the seeker to get back up and try again.	labels:So it sounds like the birthday is a time for self-reflection, and you're not happy with where you are right now?
text:yea that's right. It's weighing heavy on my mind at the moment. The seeker feels a lot of self-hatred on herself. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has achieved so much in her life by this age.	labels:Is this something you've felt on previous birthdays?
text:yes, the older I get the worse the feeling is. I didn't used to hate birthdays when I was younger. The seeker is feeling self-hatred and the supporter could lead her to talk about her goals.	labels:I'll confess I have felt the same way, especially with "milestone" birthdays (30, 40, 50, etc.). Do you think you are possibly expect too much in terms of achievements?
text:Yes, those are hard. My 30th was difficult. Society has so many wrong ideas of where people need to be, and it just doesn't apply to me. I'm so different from normal people. maybe, but being autistic, even average achievements are hard for me. I have to work so hard just to be average. May I ask, how did you deal with your own birthday depression? Maybe I can learn from you. The seeker is feeling that her self-hatred is weighing on her mind. The supporter should be a good listener, and let the seeker feel open about her feelings.	labels:As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  "normal people" and being "average" really mean. Am I comparing myself to something that even exists?
text:That's what I've been thinking about too. It probably doesn't exist, but society would have us believe otherwise. The seeker feels very sad. The supporter should ask the seeker more details about her birthday.	labels:That's so true. It's tough to deal with. But I will same, as I became older, I just stopped caring as much about what other's think. It just happened.
text:Yep, it sure is. I figure people stop caring that much when they get older. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could give the seeker an idea to practice for depression.	labels:Also, I'm sure there are some things in life you are good at, even if those aren't what society seems to value.
text:I've already stopped caring what people younger than me think. They just seem so young to me. yea, it's just hard when I struggle so much with employment. My issues really keep me from succeeding in jobs. Sure, there are things I can do; but they don't seem to help me with anything important in life, if you know what I mean. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask about the reason behind this.	labels:Yeah, I hear you. Are you talking to others -  such as professionals, etc. - about your autism?
text:I was forced into therapy as a young person. I think it put me off seeking professional help because I hated the experience. But I talk to other autistic people in support groups online. Also, I'm sorry to cut this off but I need to go soon. I want to tell you you're quite compassionate and kind. The seeker feels lonely and is thinking about what to do about that. The supporter could suggest some things that could help.	labels:Being "forced" to do anything is usually a turn off. But it's good to hear there are groups online to help.
text:I've enjoyed talking to you. Yes indeed. It's not a great experience unless you choose it. The seeker feels lonely, and the supporter should focus on the seeker's need.	labels:Oh, thanks. It's always nice to have a real conversation with someone.
text:For sure. May I ask if you're planning to become a counselor? I didn't know if this simulation is for people to get training for that type of wokr. The seeker feels lonely and lonely and she wants to know if the supporter is considering becoming a counselor. The supporter gives some information about how good it is to have a conversation with someone online and then encourages the seeker to look into it.	labels:I haven't planned on it, but I am looking for a career change. But no, this wasn't training for me. Not sure what this simulation is all about :)
text:Oh cool. I think this is a pretty interesting platform. haha me too, but it seemed interesting. The seeker feels lonely and unhappy about the birthday. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone in her feelings. In addition, her supporter can offer suggestions of things to think about that will help her feel better, even if they are not in her immediate future.	labels:Yep. Oh well, hope this was worth while for you.
text:I came here the other day and never got matched with anyone so I left. Thanks, it was. And you seem really cool. I guess we can wrap up since it's over 15 mins. and they said we can stop after 15 i think. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Thanks. Be sure to do something enjoyable on your birthday..
text:Thank you:) Hope you enjoy your day/night. The seeker feels stressed about her birthday. The supporter should tell the seeker there are things she can do to make herself feel better.	labels:OK. Do I just hit "Quit"? I forget.
text:I think we both have the finish button. So we can click any time. I'll exit now. See you:) The seeker feels lonely and worried about her birthday, but the supporter is supportive in telling her what she can do to celebrate her birthday. The supporter helps the seeker feel like she has a community of people to talk to.	labels:Take care.	episode_done:True
text:hello, how're you? The seeker feels being lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:GOOD. What bring you here today.
text:I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk) The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that since COVID your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself?
text:Yes. Sure they've tried to stay in touch but it's always me starting the conversation. Or if they start it, it only involves "hi how're you, good how're you," and then the conversation ends. The seeker has many reasons to feel lonely. The supporter should try to understand the seeker's emotions more deeply. The supporter could say, "When you say that your friends don't care about you, I'm sorry that you feel that way. I don't understand why you feel that way." The supporter could also say, "You are trying to be a good person and you want to protect your family.	labels:I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately.  Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way?
text:Yes. They say that because I'm not hanging out with them physically, it's hard. They also say that I don't put effort into conversations when I feel like I am the only one putting in effort (which I have stated and they have said I don't). The seeker feels sad and lost without her friends. The supporter could ask the seeker to think of the people around her to feel loved.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to COVID and they are choosing to not? Is that correct?
text:Yes this is correct.. The seeker feels lonely and isolated due to COVID and does not have a close group of friends. The supporter could tell the seeker that they have family members that are also keeping their distance and the supporter has been doing the same. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the supporter has also been keeping their distance from others because of COVID.	labels:Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time.  You should not feel bad about what you are doing.
text:Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should try to help the seeker focus on the important things in her life that she can control.	labels:Do you have any other friends besides this group?  Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?
text:I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out.. The seeker wants to feel accepted and like she does have friends. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing the right thing by taking precautions due to COVID and protecting herself and others. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the supporter knows how she is feeling.	labels:What hobbies or activities do you like to do?
text:I play field hockey so I train a lot in my basement (because I'm scared to go out to the gym), I listen to music, read, watch Christmas movies, and I love talking to people. Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time. It's just hard finding other friends right now in the times we're living in. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could have asked the seeker why she feels lonely and sad.	labels:Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!  That does sound like it would keep you busy. Have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to ?
text:I don't want to go actually practice on a field right now because 1.) It's rather cold outside 2.) I have to wear a mask 3.) I'd only shoot on goal, waste gas, and a good chunk of time. But when I have other people it is fun. I haven't tried that because where would I even go? I don't want to be desperate either ya know? The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker, she needs to focus on the things she can control and not worry so much about the uncontrollable things. Also, supporter can make a suggestion to the seeker to get out of the house and do something fun.	labels:I understand that you feel that you would look desperate but you said you like reading book so there may be some online book clubs that you could join.  I know that I have been involved in those and I didn't feel like I was seen as desperate since there are so many people that want to be social but don't want to put themselves at risk.
text:I never thought of that! That's is an amazing idea -- maybe I will look into that. Thank you for talking with me today. The seeker feels a bit lonely and sad. The supporter could ask the seeker why she is feeling that way. The supporter could also ask the seeker what she would like to do in the future to bring her back to feeling happier.	labels:I am so glad I was able to help. Maybe we can try and set up another time to talk again?
text:Sure! The seeker feels sad, lonely, and sad about the loss of her friends.	labels:Sounds great. You can let me know if you found a book club.
text:Awesome! Thanks again for everything -- and merry christmas. or happy holidays sorry. The seeker feels lonely and sad and the supporter helps the seeker by telling her what she can do to feel better.	labels:You are so very welcome.  Merry Christmas to you too! .  I look forward to talking to you soon!.	episode_done:True
text:I'm sooo pissed at my friend! The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to calm down.	labels:Hi. I see that you are upset.  I have been at times as well.. What about your friend is making you upset?
text:I was completely betrayed by him! The seeker is angry at her friend. The supporter could ask the seeker to share her emotions.	labels:What about him has made you feel betrayed?
text:I told my friend I kind of have a thing for this guy in our friend group and he actually told the guy! This guys has a girlfriend and I'm really cool with her. Now everything is soooo awkward. The seeker is upset about her friend betraying her. The supporter could tell the seeker that the friend is not really her friend and she should try to be more understanding of that.	labels:I have been in situations where similar comments have been made.
text:My friend has been drinking a lot and he cant keep his drunk mouth shut. I'm like ready to completely dump him as a friend in a minute. I mean, it's covid. He should just stay tf home. The seeker is upset and angry. She is ready to dump the friend. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are not alone in the situation and that the friend is also having a hard time with the changes in their relationship. To change the topic, the supporter could ask a question to the seeker about what is making her upset. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to express their feelings.	labels:Could you tell him that he could see a professional that could help him quit drinking? What ways could you find some support groups  for your friend regarding his issues?
text:I mean, I have sort of said it before in a really joking way. But now i'm worried it may be a problem. I feel like if he wants help he should find it himself. The seeker is worried about her friend drinking. The supporter should make her feel supported and that she's doing the right thing.	labels:It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.
text:he has completely isolated me from ppl i care about. The seeker feels betrayed, and the supporter helps him to focus on the good things that has happened to her, instead of what the supporter feels the seeker should focus on.	labels:How long has this isolating been occurring? I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER.
text:Well, one time he got drunk and kept calling me ugly in a joking way while we were at a party with a group of new ppl. He seems to have an agenda to embarass me. The seeker feels lonely, angry and hurt. The supporter could tell the seeker that her friend is a good sport about the situation and the supporter is happy to help.	labels:There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend. I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.
text:I think I have to ask him to get help and withdraw my friendship, completely if he chooses to continue the way he is. The seeker feels unhappy and frustrated, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details, perhaps the seeker could tell the supporter about her boyfriends behavior.	labels:I am glad to provide suggestions like AA and other support groups.
text:Thank you very much. The seeker feels upset about her friend's behavior. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing the right thing by asking for help for her friend.	labels:What else can I help you with? Were my suggestions helpful?
text:Yes, I guess I just wonder if I should include our other friends. The seeker has been isolated from other people and the supporter is trying to encourage the seeker to get help.	labels:I feel that the right suggestions can help.  Alcohol can be a real issue with maintaining meaningful relationships.
text:Is it betrayal if i tell them that he has been drinking excessively? The seeker feels that her friend has betrayed her. The supporter is giving her some ideas about how to cope with the situation.	labels:You could also be part of his support group if he agrees to AA. No, I don't feel it is betrayal. You care about him. Do you have any more questions or concerns for me to reflect on?	episode_done:True
text:Hi. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask the seeker about how she is feeling, try to distract the seeker from her unhappiness and ask how the supporter could help.	labels:Hello. How may i help you today?
text:I had misunderstanding with my friend and I have fear that I am gonna loose her. The seeker feels lonely and afraid of losing her friend.	labels:Can you explain to me what the misunderstanding was about?
text:I was bit busy and wasn't able to talk to her for a few days, so  she thought I was ignoring her. The seeker is scared because she had misunderstanding with her friend. It can be very dangerous for a supporter to tell the seeker to be honest, but it is still a good idea to help the seeker.  	labels:Ok i see so she thinks you are ignoring her?
text:Yes, she thinks I am ignoring her, but I never meant to do that. I tried to tell her that I was busy with some work, but she thought I was lying to her and now I'm very sad. The seeker is feeling lonely and sad and worried about losing her friend. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to put a positive focus on her work, because she will get paid on the job.	labels:I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.
text:What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore! The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Have you tried to talk to her again recently?
text:Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls.. The seeker feels very lonely and the supporter should show their compassion for the seeker.	labels:I would give her 2 or 3 days to her self then try to talk to her again.
text:Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her. The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has someone to talk to and share her problems with.	labels:Maybe you should go up to her house.
text:Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :( The seeker is very sad and feeling lonely about her friend, but she doesn't want to risk others.  The supporter could encourage her to reach out to her friend again, and this time talk to her face to face. 	labels:Right i can understand.
text:We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship.. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter should ask what happened between the seeker and friend. The supporter could also suggest a better way to talk to the friend.	labels:I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her. Send her a apology card in the mail.
text:I appreciate your suggestions. This sounds like a good option. Thank you so much for your help! The seeker feels lonely and afraid to loose her friend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is there for her and will support as much as she can.	labels:your welcome I hope yall will work it out.

text:I am sooo pissed at my ex. The seeker is angry and she is not feeling lonely. The supporter could ask the seeker why she feels angry and what she wants to happen now.	labels:Hai.
text:hi. The seeker feels pissed at her ex. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should make some new friends to cheer her up.	labels:why? Any problem?
text:well we were together for 3 years. he broke up with me a week ago but we're on the lease for the apartment and share the place with 5 other people. He moved into the room we had open. but now he's turning my roommates against me. i think he's pissed because i'm dating my other ex again. The seeker is angry about the situation. The supporter should ask the seeker why she's angry.	labels:oh, you settle elsewhere.
text:you think i should move? The seeker feels upset and frustrated. The supporter should help the seeker understand the situation and give some options to make her feel better.	labels:yes.
text:This place is amazing tho and my dad is the cosigner. the landlord would never let my roomies take over the lease with their credit. i'm thinking of kicking all them out, actually. i dont want to. i just want to be friends witgh everyone again. we were all so close. The seeker is angry because of her ex's behavior. The supporter could advise the seeker to be more careful about her choices in the future and focus on her other relationships.	labels:ok clarify your friendship value.
text:I have 2 roommates that actually moved here with me from my previous apartment. The rest r new but they're sweet and we've really bonded. we all tripped shrooms together one night and we are like really close now. The seeker wants to kick her other ex out of the apartment, and the supporter wants the seeker to be happy with her situation.	labels:ok, tell your friend what you think.
text:it's just sooo uncomfortable to discuss. what if im just being paranoid. i mean part of me feels like they just feel awkward and arent icing me out on purpose. The seeker feels uncomfortable about her relationship with her ex boyfriend. The supporter could say that it's normal to feel uncomfortable about your relationship. The supporter could also tell the seeker to let her friend know that she's being paranoid about the situation.	labels:clarify, what you think.
text:i mean no one has specifically said anything to me that was negative, but suddenly i feel like people are avoiding me. we used to hang out in the living room all the time and we would eat these big meals, but yesterday i came home and they were all cooking with my ex. they said they made enough for me but it seemed like such an after thought. The seeker feels awkward to talk to her roommates because the supporter has not yet told her that the seeker is paranoid. The supporter should have clarified that the seeker is not paranoid. In this conversation, the supporter should have suggested the seeker to tell the roommate what she thinks.	labels:That problem would not be possible  if you did not speak.
text:you mean if we DID speak? The seeker feels like her friends are avoiding her. The supporter should suggest that the seeker should speak to her friends.	labels:Tell them what you think in your mind and they will surely understand.
text:i think i just want to know that we're all still friends, i guess. I want our house to feel like home, again. The seeker is feeling paranoid about people being mean to her. The supporter can tell the seeker she'll be fine if she can be more vocal.	labels:ok, you clarify your reasons for them.
text:ok, yeah you're right. I just need to have a conversation with them. I guess. thank you. The seeker feels lonely because she thinks others are avoiding her. The supporter could tell the seeker that friendship should not be dependent on the situation.	labels:of course  everything will be fine. ok, good, best of luck,.	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you tonight?\nHey. It's the middle of the day where I am located and I'm well thanks. I have the day off work today. The seeker feels lonely, and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Oh! I live in KY and it's 8 pm at night! lol Well, good afternoon to you!  A pleasure to meet you, how can I encourage you today?
text:I have no local close friends, they all live overseas. With the holiday season it gets lonely as there's no one in my city to celebrate Christmas with. The seeker feels lonely and the supporter could give a conversation betwee a seeker and a supporter, predict the emotion status of the seeker, the reason causing that emotion and some conversation instructions for the supporter.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. I am in the same boat! We have no close friends and family near us, we moved here to a very rural area in KY some years ago, so I understand.. Do you live alone?
text:Yeah I do. The seeker is lonely and feels sad. The supporter could encourage the seeker by telling the seeker that there are people around her and there are many ways to get connected to people.	labels:One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person..
text:How did you meet them online? The seeker feels lonely and sad, but the supporter does not mention this emotion. The supporter could introduce the seeker to people around her that can help her feel loved and support her.	labels:On FB in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if I  could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so I just picked women..
text:I feel like I would struggle to establish a connection with someone over the phone. There are no restrictions in my city at the moment so I would really like to meet some people face to face. The seeker has to make a choice as she feels lonely.	labels:I was just thinking of ideas for me to make local friends too. Perhaps you could invite people to your home for Christmas, then when they say they have something occurring, perhaps they will realize you are alone and then invite you?. Are there any churches feeding people on Christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.
text:Sadly most people here spend Christmas with their families and are quite private about not inviting outsiders. Last year I spent it with a friend but he is going to his family this year. I can find out about churches, I have no idea. The seeker feels lonely with no local friends. The supporter gives some solutions to the seeker.	labels:I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the FB search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too..
text:Yeah I'll give that a go. The seeker feels lonely and wants to meet people. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to meet people face to face.	labels:There always seems to be people in the same boat I am in, it is just a matter of thinking outside the box and perhaps even calling friends and asking for suggestions. I will definitely say a prayer that you find some people to share a meal with..
text:Thanks for listening and for your suggestions. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:You are welcome. Don't give up, keep trying. It is hard. I've been alone a few times in my life and while I like to be alone, sometimes I really want some people in my life! :D .
text:Yeah I do enjoy my alone time, just not around the holidays haha. The seeker feels lonely and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to stop thinking about her boyfriend and trying to force her relationship to work.	labels:I totally get it..
text:Thanks and have a good night! The seeker feels lonely, the supporter gives the seeker some resources to help.	labels:You are welcome! You have a blessed afternoon and evening!. I believe you have to end the conversation and then we are done! :D.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there. Is there anything bothering you that you'd like to talk about at the moment?.\nHi. Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas. The seeker feels lonely and lonely. The supporter could tell that the seeker is feeling lonely and sad this year. The supporter should tell the seeker what can be done to make her feel better. 	labels:Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse..
text:When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay. The seeker is a little depressed. The supporter can show that the supporter feels the same. The supporter should suggest that the seeker can talk to friends and family about this.	labels:So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?.
text:I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us. The seeker feels lonely, but she is trying to not express it all to everyone. The supporter could tell her that it's okay to be lonely.	labels:Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?.
text:Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that. The seeker feels sad and lonely. She feels that her friends would feel upset to know she is feeling bad. She realizes that she is bringing her friends down.	labels:Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately..
text:Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone. The seeker feels she has to be strong and not to let people know that she is sad. This is because she is afraid that people will make her feel bad. However, her friends would be helpful.	labels:I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?.
text:I have a brother, but his wife is really terrible, and they are very close. He and I text some, and I try to keep that up. He doesn't need me the way I need him... The seeker feels that her friends would be supportive, but she feels it would be selfish of her to bring them down by talking about her own situation.	labels:What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free.
text:Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video... The seeker feels lonely and scared because she is afraid that she is not able to make her friends feel that she is having a good time. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?.
text:The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization. The seeker feels stressed, lonely and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk with her brother and her doctor.	labels:Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have..
text:If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups... Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start? The seeker feels lonely, frustrated about feeling lonely, and her brother is not a good support. The supporter could offer the seeker the support of her friends and her medical team.	labels:There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?. I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you..
text:Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet. It's a hard time for making new connections. Thank you - best wishes to you, too! The seeker feels lonely and upset about the death of her father. She needs a support group to help her.	labels:That is tough ... so you are feeling uprooted as well as bereaved? I can only hope things go well for you.
text:At least I'll never lose another parent... The seeker thinks she is lonely and wants to have contact with friends. The supporter could encourage her to reach out to friends and family. The supporter could encourage the seeker to be positive and see the support around her.	labels:That's a slightly macabre way of looking at it but .. true.. Have a lovely festive season.
text:You too. Bring on 2021!! The seeker feels lonely and wants to find some good support groups.	labels:quite!! Do press the quit button and take the survey ;).	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHello. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:How may i help you today?
text:I have a co worker who sleeps all the time at his desk.  I physically work hard everyday. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask the seeker to say more about the co worker.	labels:I can understand how you are feeling..
text:It makes me mad.  No one says a word to him, he just sleeps and gets paid for it. The seeker has an emotion of boredom. The supporter could ask the seeker for more details.	labels:Has anyone else noticed him sleeping all the time at his desk?
text:My boss said (I have been there for five years) to me one day did I see DE sleeping at his desk? I was floored that it seemed he never saw him do it before.  How could he not? The seeker feels lonely and wants someone to talk to. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can talk to her boss and ask her to give the co worker a warning that he could be fired if he continues sleeping in the office.	labels:That is really weird how can someone not see him sleeping at his desk.
text:Very weird.  I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor.  Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping. The seeker feels lonely, but she does not mention the reason. The supporter can ask for more details about why the seeker feels lonely.	labels:Have you talked to your co worker about it?
text:It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss.  He obviously said nothing. . The seeker feels frustrated and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker what the seeker wants so that the supporter can offer what the supporter can do.	labels:if your boss said nothing to him then maybe you should step up and say something even though you are right that is not your place.
text:I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him. The seeker feels frustrated and sad.	labels:Your boss does not sound like a good boss at all and not doing his job correctly.
text:Definitely not being fair across the board, in my eyes. The seeker does not feel lonely but feels frustrated that no one notices the sleeping co worker. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a good boss and that she should talk to her boss about the sleeping co worker.	labels:i feel like you should have like a serious talk to your boss about it.
text:You're probably correct.  I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter suggests to the seeker that she should focus on the positive things in her life.	labels:I don't want you feeling how you feeling because you are doing your job and you are doing everything you can to solve the problem.
text:Thank you, that helps hearing that from someone. . The seeker feels annoyed about her co worker not doing his job correctly and not being fair across the board, in her eyes. The supporter might have told the seeker to talk to her boss and that the situation is not fair. The supporter might have asked the seeker to get to the bottom of the reason for the co worker not doing his job correctly. The supporter might have suggested that the co worker should be fired	labels:How long has this been going on? Your welcome.
text:Seriously, over two years.  True. The seeker feels frustrated with her work and the supporter could tell the seeker how she feels, so she could calm down.	labels:How many times have you confronted your boss about it?
text:I never have, I just looked at him like are you for real when he asked me if the guy was sleeping the one day.  I had to bite my tongue not to say, yes, and he does it every day! The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker some things to be happy about. As the supporter, you should focus on the seeker's situation and answer the seeker's concerns with some suggestions.	labels:So he must not believe you.
text:Well thank you for letting me get this out.  I appreciate the advice and I will definitely think over talking with my boss.  Have a good night! The seeker feels lonely, stressed and frustrated. The supporter should focus on the seeker's feelings and try to help the seeker feel better.	labels:have a good night to and your welcome.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHello. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker she has people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:How are you today?
text:Really bad. My 10 year marriage is failing. Things have not gotten better. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could ask if there is anything he can do to help.	labels:What happened?
text:That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore. The seeker feels lonely, but no reason is given. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?
text:Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late.. The seeker feels discouraged and frustrated. The supporter should encourage the seeker with a positive attitude.	labels:Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.
text:I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so? The seeker feels lonely and wants to get away. The supporter could offer to give her a massage or something to help her relax.	labels:Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life. It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.
text:I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start. The seeker feels lonely and stressed and the supporter focuses on the seeker's emotion. The supporter should ask for more details about the reason for the emotions.	labels:Start by talking about whats going on. Tell her how you think you guys should spend more time with her. Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.
text:I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that. The seeker feels anxious because of the issues in the relationship. The supporter asks more about the issues.	labels:I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.
text:If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself. The seeker is having a hard time talking to her wife about her feelings. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is difficult for her to talk about things when they are unhappy.	labels:Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.
text:I think that sounds like a safer choice. I was also hoping if you have suggestions for me personally. I am quite depressed and I am having problems getting through the day. The seeker is depressed and the supporter should focus on the seeker's emotional state.	labels:I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can.. If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it. I think it would be a great start.
text:Thank you very much for your response. You have been very helpful. Perhaps, one last question - my wife and I have been hiding our problems away from our teen-age son. Do you agree that we should continue to keep it from him? The seeker wants to hide the information from her son. The supporter should not agree to this.	labels:Depending on the nature, I think you should let him know whats going on. He may already know.
text:Ok, thanks for all your help again. I feel much better now, and hopefully I will get through this. The seeker is very depressed and anxious. The supporter should encourage the seeker to see a therapist to get things out. The supporter should also tell the seeker to find a male therapist.	labels:I know its really hard, but I think you guys with work things out. Have hope. Times are stressful, especially in this day and age.
text:Take care, friend, good-bye. The seeker and supporter agree that their marriage is failing, while the seeker feels that she has been trying for a long time to initiate their marriage back into life. The supporter suggests the seeker should make sure she is thinking about the marriage the whole time, and not just her relationship with her boyfriend.	labels:goodbye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello! Is there something I can help you with? Would you like to tell me how you're feeling?\nyes. i have been facing trouble in my job. The seeker feels stressed and lonely because she is facing trouble. The supporter could tell the seeker to work on improving the situation.	labels:Right now, are you still employed?
text:yes. The seeker feels stress about failing her job. The supporter should make sure that the seeker is aware of the fact that she is still employed and she should be aware of the fact that the supporter is helping her in other ways. The supporter should also tell the seeker that she is being honest with her and the supporter is trying to help her.	labels:What kind of troubles are you facing at your job?
text:there is an announcement that my company has decided to give layoff to 50 percent of their employees. The seeker feels worried about the job situation. The supporter should ask the seeker more details.	labels:Oh, I can understand how worried you must be! Do you think you will be laid off?
text:yes . The seeker is very worried about the announcement. The supporter could tell the seeker that the company has not yet decided to layoff any employees. The supporter could even tell the seeker that the company is not going to make the announcement today.	labels:I am so very sorry to hear that. Do you mind me asking what type of job it is?
text:i am working as a supervisor in a private manufacturing company. currently working from home. feeling so depressed regarding this issue. The seeker feels lonely and depressed because of the news from her company. The supporter can tell the seeker that she is going to be fine.	labels:I have been in a similar situation and understand how scary it is. Have you been looking for another job or are you waiting to see if you are laid off?
text:yes i am trying for another job, but is not so easy to get in this covid 19 pandemic situation. The seeker is feeling sad and worried about her job. The supporter could ask the seeker about the job.	labels:Yes! The pandemic has turned the world upside down, it seems like..
text:yes that is main reason for depression. The seeker is feeling depressed. The supporter should ask why the seeker is depressed.	labels:Have you thought of going back to school or have you completed your education?
text:i have completed my bachelor degree. The seeker is very depressed and doesn't feel like working anymore. She is looking for another job but no avail. It is not a very kind conversation.	labels:I am so very sorry that you are struggling with depression..
text:yes, i cant know how to get  normal from this depression. The seeker feels lonely and depressed because she is worried about being laid off. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has a lot of support around her and she should continue to look for a new job.	labels:You have been a supervisor and you already have your degree, so you are ahead of lots of people. Have you been able to see a doctor or a therapist to talk to?
text:yes ,. The seeker as been a supervisor and is feeling depressed because of the layoff. The supporter could ask the seeker whether she has been feeling depressed.	labels:And I know that sounded presumptuous of me to say "you are ahead of lots of people", but it does seem like a "positive" in your favor.. I'm glad you have been able to talk to someone..
text:thank you. i am also feeling so relieved while talking with you. The seeker s feeling sad and depressed. The supporter should ask about the reason for her distress.	labels:I feel like the world is in some kind of "holding" pattern until the pandemic is under control.. I'm glad just talking has made you feel a little better!.
text:yes this pandemic situation gives more tough situations. lets pray that the pandemic situation will come to an end soon. The seeker feels lonely and worried. It is not clear what is the reason for her feeling. The supporter needs to understand the reason.	labels:Amen to that!.
text:amen. thanks. The seeker feels very lonely because she has been looking for a job and has been having trouble. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is in the same situation. The supporter could also ask the seeker about how she is doing.	labels:I am hoping that you will find a new (and better!) job that you absolutely love!  Stay safe...and positive!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there! The seeker feels alone, but the reason for her feeling is not revealed. The supporter should ask the seeker to tell more details.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:Oh, not too bad - and you? The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I'm doing well. How can I help you today?
text:I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too... But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway. The seeker feels frustrated. The supporter could ask why the seeker is frustrated with this cousin.	labels:I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?
text:We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her.	labels:Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?
text:Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though. The seeker is frustrated because of her cousin's unpredictable behavior. The supporter could encourage the seeker to open up with her cousin about her frustration and ask for more details about the cousin's behavior.	labels:That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?
text:Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. Maybe the supporter could advise the seeker to keep a journal about how she feels. And then the supporter could encourage the seeker by saying that she has a lot of people who support her.	labels:Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?
text:Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say? The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker what she thinks, but should also tell the seeker that the supporter has not been able to find a solution to this problem.	labels:All of the above!
text:Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue. The seeker feels frustrated by her cousin. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Do you think these issues are serious enough to get a proffessional involved?
text:Well, she has her therapist. I'm not sure what I could really do. The seeker is concerned about her cousin. It is good that the supporter gave some tips to the seeker. The supporter could mention an event in the future to help.	labels:You may have to make a decision and determine how big her issues are.
text:Yes.... I think talking to our other cousin about her might be a good place to start. The seeker feels lonely and doesn't feel like she's getting enough support. The supporter can ask the seeker if she has a counselor. The supporter could ask the seeker about how the emotions are affecting the seeker's relationship with her cousin.	labels:Yes. How do you feel about doing that? Do you think that would help?
text:I think it might help... It's one of these things - everyone has so much going on in their own lives... But of course it's also therapeutic to feel like you're helping someone you love. So it might be good for both cousins. All three cousins. The seeker has to solve the problem of her cousin's uncontrolled temper. The supporter should suggest some possible solutions.	labels:I think that sounds like a great thing! Sometimes we just need to get together and help out the people we love going through tough times!
text:Yes, I agree... Well, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for talking to me. The seeker feels frustrated with her cousin. The supporter could explain to the seeker that she can try to be creative and positive with the cousin.	labels:Of course! I hope all goes well!
text:You too. Have a great holiday. SO ready for a new year, with new promise... The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely. The supporter should help the seeker see the good she has in her life.	labels:You as well!
text:Bye-bye! The seeker feels frustrated and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Bye!	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you this evening? The seeker is feeling very happy, as she thinks of her boyfriend. The supporter needs to find out how to help the seeker feel more positive.	labels:Hello Doing good. How are doing?
text:I've been better. The holidays aren't helping me feel better about not bringing much money home to help pay for things. The seeker feels sad, lonely and like she is failing in her job. The supporter can empathize with the seeker and understand her feelings.	labels:Sorry to hear this,have you ever tried selling on Ebay.
text:I've thought about selling stuff online, but the cost of selling things online isn't really worth it. I've been trying to use facebook marketplace, but I never have anyone who's interested. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter should try to cheer the seeker up.	labels:Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.
text:I've heard of QVC, but I've never heard of QVC liquidations. That might be something for me to consider. Can you give me more details about it? The seeker is thinking of selling things online, but she doesn't know the right way to do it. The supporter should lead her to the right direction.	labels:If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id.
text:I see. Is this something that you've done to make money? The seeker is not happy to hear his wife is on the verge of quitting her job. The supporter should ask the seeker open-ended questions.	labels:Absolutely.
text:If you don't mind me asking how much have you made using QVC liquidations? The seeker has heard of QVC liquidations, but does not know it is a way to make money. The supporter will try to help her see how she can potentially make money with this method.	labels:I have made close to 12,000.00 in one year just reselling the returns.Also ESTY is  also a great place.
text:Wow, what sorts of things have you sold? The seeker is interested to know more about QVC liquidations. The supporter should discuss ways this can be done.	labels:Go to EBAY and scroll down to the the completed section and click it and this will show you the item your searching like homemade items or stuff like back packs that maybe on sell at Walmart and I buy them and see what they are selling for.
text:Okay, thanks for the suggestions. The seeker does not feel lonely.  The supporter could ask the seeker if she would like to sell her things on EBAY or ESTY.	labels:I have purchased a lot of stuff from walmart and resold it on EBAY. Its fun.
text:I worked with someone whose boyfriend did that. I've never thought about doing that. I might have to consider doing that so I can feel more helpful to my husband. The seeker feels lonely and worried about bringing home less money than she had expected. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can buy home items on EBAY.	labels:Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper.
text:I don't shop at Walmart very much so thank you for that information. The seeker had a great conversation with the supporter, so she felt more confident and she would become more helpful to her husband.	labels:I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.
text:That is very interesting. I wouldn't think you could make that much from small surfboards. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. But the seeker is not in a negative mood and she has a good attitude. She could talk to her husband about her problems, if she wants to, but she doesn't have to. She can tell him how she feels and he may be able to help her. She needs to find out if he is willing to be there for her and she needs to know how she	labels:He painted them and they looked awesome.
text:I wouldn't think that anyone would want a short surfboard, but I guess I don't know anything about surfing. The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely, the supporter would like to build a relationship with the seeker. The supporter could suggest the seeker focus on the things she needs to do in her life to improve her situation.	labels:People who own and rent their beach house always looking for some new looks.
text:I suppose you are right. Well thanks for the helpful suggestions to make more money. The seeker feels alone and worried. The supporter should ask the seeker how the supporter can help her feel better.	labels:Your welcome Don't ever give up there is always ways to make a difference.
text:I appreciate your help. Have a good night! The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:You too.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon/evening. The seeker is a student. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot to learn and that she is still working on herself.	labels:Hello, how are you tonight?
text:Doing great. How about yourself? The seeker feels lonely and she feels herself going to go home. The supporter could tell the seeker that she does not have to go home, and she can stay at the supporter's house.	labels:I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?
text:So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary.A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. The seeker is anxious and worried about the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that the problem is not one that is going to resolve because of money, but the supporter could make the seeker feel like they are not alone.	labels:I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?
text:I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. The seeker feels frustrated because of her situation. The supporter should inform her about the situation and try to give her some ideas.	labels:I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?
text:It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I dont. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too. The seeker feels frustrated, trapped and angry. The supporter can ask questions to try to understand the seeker's emotions better.	labels:I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?.
text:I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do. The seeker feels frustrated because the supporter is not respecting the 6 foot boundary and the seeker feels like he is trapped. The supporter could ask the seeker if he feels guilty about not respecting the boundary and if the seeker feels guilty. The supporter could also ask if the seeker feels he can't leave because he has a sick child.	labels:Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?
text:Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part-time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions? The seeker feels frustrated, frustrated, frustrated and trapped. The supporter could ask the seeker for more information. In the seeker's response, she mentions that she is struggling with the idea of quitting.	labels:We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?
text:That sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I do get paid vacation. The seeker feels frustrated because of the challenges she is facing. She would love to have a better job with more money. She feels trapped. She feels guilty for putting her son at risk. She feels guilty for having to work. The supporter asks more questions to help the seeker feel less trapped.	labels:Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you tonight?\nhanging in there, kinda freaking out a little. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should tell the seeker to stop thinking about it and to just focus on her family and friends.	labels:I'm sorry to hear you are freaking out. Perhaps a friendly listening ear can encourage you? Why are you freaking out?
text:I think that'll help, yeah. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter doesn't know the reason. The supporter could tell the seeker to be positive and try to think of things that make her feel loved.	labels:Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down..
text:I decided to leave my husband, he keeps snapping at me and won't listen to me or let me do anything. The seeker is feeling lonely and she thinks her husband is not going to listen to her or understand. The supporter can tell her that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:That's a difficult decision you have made..
text:I'm worried how it'll go though because we have kids. The seeker is feeling lonely and stressed. The supporter can suggest a plan for the seeker to make it through the tough time.	labels:Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor?.
text:I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me. The seeker is already feeling lonely and worried about her decision. However, the supporter can encourage the seeker.	labels:I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave.  Do you have a plan in place?
text:I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could offer to listen to her.	labels:My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.
text:I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying. The seeker feels that her husband will try to stop her and she is worried about it. The supporter should empathize with the seeker and find out the reason for her fear.	labels:Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?
text:He hasn't hurt me physically. I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker what she is worried about and encourage her.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling..
text:I think that's the best idea. The seeker is feeling lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there is a person to make her feel being loved and support.	labels:Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious..
text:that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend. The seeker feels lonely, she also feels worried about the breakup. The supporter can encourage the seeker to relax and not worry about things she can't control.	labels:I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet..
text:hey may not realize I'd leave at all. me too, that's making all the difference. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend, the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that..
text:definitely that makes sense. The seeker is worried about the boyfriend and how it will affect her kids. The supporter could encourage the seeker to seek a counselor and to think of ways to support the kids if everything goes wrong.	labels:He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it..
text:I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Ouch! That sounds painful to look at..
text:it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags. The seeker feels lonely and her husband is making her feel that way. The supporter could be more supportive by making the seeker feel loved.	labels:People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.. How long have you been married?
text:eight years, together for 11. The seeker feels upset, alone and hurt, and the supporter should try to empathize with her.	labels:That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.. Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave..
text:absolutely! definitely no paper trail, for sure. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could encourage the seeker to be hopeful and focused on the positive things in her life to boost her up.	labels:I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God..
text:I know that one, it's helping me a lot too. The seeker feels lonely, stressed and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should ask the seeker how she is feeling and where she is on breaking up with her boyfriend.	labels:If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.. And I urge you to get a counselor..
text:that's good advice! I will. Thank you. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should help the seeker focus on doing something to make her feel more loved.	labels:You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children.
text:definitely, I think I can do that! I feel a lot better! The seeker is feeling lonely and worried about leaving her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:It's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it. That's a big plus on yoru side..
text:Thank you! I'm feeling a lot more confident! The seeker feels confident and strong.	labels:I'm glad to hear it. Keep the faith, all will be well in due time! Sometimes rough roads really work out, but it never FEELS that way!  You have a good night! :D.	episode_done:True
text:hi. The seeker feels not being loved, but the supporter doesn't know the reason. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Hello. How are you?
text:I don't know how to cope with Martins anymore. I am fine anyway. The seeker feels lonely and the supporter should provide some conversation instructions.	labels:What is Martins?
text:WE have been friends for the past 10 years, I have been trying to ignore his fake and lie life style. The seeker feels lonely and worries about her boyfriend.	labels:My sorry this is happening to you. Would you like to talk about it?

The seeker feels stressed and angry. The supporter should try to help the seeker by asking some questions that could improve the situation.	labels:I have had old friends do that do me. The best thing to do is let go of them and try to find a better friend. I had a friend that I was friends with for 11 years and she dropped out of the blue. Since then, I have come across a lot of amazing friends..
text:he will never tell you truth. If Martins is seeing red like this in your front , he will tell you is white. mmmmh. The seeker feels lonely and worry about Martins. The supporter can encourage the seeker to find a new friend.	labels:That's really had to deal with. Try to surround yourself with loyal and truthful people.
text:I really wish to drop this guy out of the blue but it is our business that still attaché us together. He do help me collect my goods from Canada a. The seeker feels lonely and worried about losing her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest ways to let go of him and try to find a better friend.	labels:Do you guys run a business together?
text:not really. at a time , I will not want to leave my family to go to Canada for some goods, he do go there often. that is only major thing that still bind us. I should have let he go off my life. The seeker feels lonely, worried about his friend and his relationship with his girlfriend. The supporter could ask the seeker the seeker why he feel lonely and why he keep talking about his girlfriend.	labels:I understand. Maybe you could find a better friend to help you go to Canada or take a vacation to Canada sometimes.
text:ok. The seeker feels like she is being lied, so she makes up a story to make the supporter believe.	labels:Its really hard but  I think you can do it. You will feel much better about not having to deal with lies all the time.
text:I hate lies, it really pain me if a you lie to me. yes of cause. thanks , for you time. bye. The seeker feeling lonely and is trying to get away from a guy that she does not believe is true.	labels:bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, My name is DJ, Thank you for your time. How are you? The seeker feels lonely and she is thinking about the person that she wants to talk to. The supporter could tell the seeker about a new friend that she has, or a person who she feels comfortable.	labels:Hi, I'm Vicky! I'm doing pretty well :) How can I help you through your issues today?
text:I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. As far as the issue, I'm not sure how you can other than listening and encouraging. The seeker is feeling lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker, "I understand how you feel." The supporter should give some conversation instruction to the seeker.	labels:No problem! I would love to be a listening ear for you to talk about it and work through anything stuck in your mind.
text:Yeah, she is visiting for a couple of days. It is great to see her and our Grand-baby. He had to work so he's not here. He's a great guy to everyone else. But not to her. We can see how their relationship has decreased and the little one is copying his poor behavious. The seeker feels lonely and feels like he is the only person who is not happy with his relationship. The supporter should tell the seeker he can help and the seeker should ask him about his relationship with his wife.	labels:omgsh I'm so sorry to hear that. Is this your daughter's partner? I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship before and know how difficult it can be.
text:It is good for her to be here with us. She can talk with her Mother and pray together. Yes, this  is her husband. I'm sorry to hear you went through the emotional abuse.. It is rough. I've got to be careful not to react to him. The seeker feels lonely and is having trouble with emotions. The supporter could say that she knows how hard the emotional abuse can be and let the seeker know that it is okay to have feelings.	labels:From my personal experience, I can say that your support really means everything to her. She may not want to admit the truth to herself, but with your support, I believe she can find the strength to get out of the relatioship.
text:Yeah, she does know what is going on between them and how it is impacting the little one. And, I am thankful she trusts us with what is going on. They both need support and strength. The seeker feels lonely and wants to be supported. The supporter could tell the seeker that a support network is there for her. The supporter can also encourage the seeker to be positive and focus on what she does have.	labels:Yes I completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though I think I tried even more times than that).

text:Yeah. He keeps going to the VA and they keep saying he is losing brain mass. Wish everyone else knew how to deal with him. Doesn't seem like everyone is equipped to deal with this kind of stress. My girlfriend already has enough on her plate with her chronic illness. Mostly the arguing starts when he tells her to eat 'normal' food. Which everyone has to keep reminding can kill her. The seeker is feeling lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should encourage the seeker to try to seek help for the feeling.	labels:Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?

The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him.
text:He thinks everyone is out to get him. He was in Vietnam for years and left him with guns without ammo to protect a post. So with that in mind... who knows. Could work out. But he has tackled medical personnel before. You could imagine the trauma that encourages that crazy mindset. However, I think I got a good idea what to suggest. At least to my girlfriend and her family. You left I guess. Interesting. Okay. well good bye. Man.. not even a proper good bye. The seeker is not feeling good. The supporter could encourage the seeker to work on doing things to take care of her mind. 	labels:im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk.	episode_done:True

text:Yes, me and my partner are considering breaking up as she wants to move to another state to be with her cousin and have a fresh start. I want to stay and be around my family.

text:I would say compared to every relationship I have had, this is the best relationship I have been in. Plus we have children involved. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should point out the reasons why she feels she may be lonely.	labels:That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision..

The seeker realizes that she needs to make a choice about staying in her current relationship or breaking up with her boyfriend.	labels:So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?
text:Yes we listened to each other but it was still a more agree to disagree conversation. No over talking or arguments. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is ok after the conversation.	labels:I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not..
