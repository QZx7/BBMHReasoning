It actually makes good sense.)... The seeker feels lonely because she is not getting sick pay or advice about help she can access. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has the support of the government and other people.	labels:So you have been getting some assistance?.
text:So I did as instructed and got the message on the website thanking me for verification.  The following week I got a physical letter saying I was approved and the award amount per week. I have gone online once a week and qualified, as one is supposed to do, and still I have not received a cent. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the COVID-19, but the supporter is not feeling it and the supporter is trying to help the seeker.	labels:I see, so you are really financially struggling at the moment? Is there anywhere else you could apply for assistance? What about a foodbank?.

The seeker feels lonely and worried about the fact she lost her job. The supporter can tell the seeker she has people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now..
text:I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open. The seeker feels lonely, stressed and concerned about her financial situation. The supporter should tell the seeker there are people around her to help her.	labels:I hope that they can help you. My partner and I have used one before and they were very helpful. I felt a bit ashamed but there was no judgement at all..
text:I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. The seeker is feeling stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is having any other stresses in her life.	labels:That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!.
text:I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. The seeker feels lonely and stressed because she is struggling to pay her bills. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to get help from the government - they are only doing their job. The supporter could also tell the seeker to try to focus on other things in her life that she can be happy about.	labels:Yes they are run by lovely people. Ours gave us a pamphlet for cheap and easy to make recipes too..
text:I am very lucky in that the organization is only 3 miles from me.  I will be looking into their rent assistance and employment assistance programs as well.

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope..
text:I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job.  Because this is an "at will" state, he can terminate me without cause.  Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant. The seeker is feeling stressed and stressed the reasons for her stress is not mentioned. The supporter can ask for more details.	labels:That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a  thing?.
text:I would not put it past him.  Sadly.  But I have taken the attitude that if it does occur, there is nothing I can do to change the situation.  I would simply pursue a charge against him for wrongful termination, and seek a new job. The seeker feels stressed and has no clue why. The supporter may have tried to tell the seeker that the seeker's situation is not the supporter's fault.	labels:That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best for the coming months.
text:I may not win the suit, but I would definitely file one.  In 2000, I had an employer fire me without cause.  I sued and won that time.  Not only did they have to pay me back wages for the 90 days that the investigation took place, which was no minor sum, The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone in the world.	labels:I am glad that you'd not roll over and accept ill treatment! Well done :).
text:they were found to be guilty, so the judge granted me my wages based on the average of 80 hour weeks I had been working, all my vacation time, plus the overtime I would have received, holiday pay, and then to put a nice bow on that gift, he awarded me 5000 dollars in damages because the old company lied and said I had broken the law. The seeker feels lonely, and she was fired without cause. The supporter should ask the seeker questions to help her feel comfortable and reassured.	labels:I am afraid I need to leave now but thank you for talking :) (can you press the quit button and take the survey?) Best wishes!
text:My current employer actually knows this happened, because years ago we discussed it, and I showed him the award letter from the Department of Labor and Training, itemizing the judge's findings and the awards. Thank you for your time.  Have a great holiday. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker about the many things she has to worry about.	labels:You too!.	episode_done:True

text:I have been staying home since last March due to COVID; getting very depressed. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter should ask her about the reasons for her loneliness and depression.	labels:Ah I hear you, I have been self isolating too. Do you have an online support network?.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a support network around her and that she can share the problems she is having.	labels:Well, friends you can talk to during this difficult time? I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that I can talk to..

text:You mean share experiences among the friends? The seeker has a support network. The supporter can show the seeker that she has friends.	labels:Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps?. Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now?.
text:Yes, I pay musical instruments but do to COVID could not play with the band. The seeker seems to have few friends and has been busy with self-isolation at home. The supporter could express to the seeker, the support netwrok they have, which could help the seeker.	labels:Could you perhaps set up Zoom meetings where you could play together online?.
text:Any idea how would it work? Would there be any delay between the sounds from different instruments? The seeker feels lonely and worried about COVID. The supporter could ask the seeker a question about the seeker's hobbies.	labels:No I don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person..
text:Thanks for the idea. I will give it a try. The seeker feels lonely and worried about being separated with her boyfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to connect with her friends and family.	labels:I hope it goes well for you. It has been such an awful year, hasn't it?.
text:Yes, it was.. worst I ever seen.. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter asks about the main reason the seeker feels lonely.	labels:I wish you all the very best for 2021. I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!.

text:Hello, what is life like for you at the moment?.\nInfinitely complicated. Too many decisions. I don't know what to do. The seeker feels confused and unsure of her decisions. The supporter could ask the seeker questions to help her make a decision and get it done.	labels:I am sorry to hear that but I am happy to listen and help you if I can. what sort of things are you trying to decide?.
text:I don't even know where to start. I'm trying to decide if I can build trust with him again. He lied about everything. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker what the reason is for this.	labels:Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment?. Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended?.
text:When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced. That was in March. I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together. ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet. The seeker feels lonely and sad because of the relationship. She feels like nobody wants to listen to her or understand what she's going through. The supporter should try to understand the situation and provide helpful suggestions.	labels:Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this..
text:I'm debating. I don't know what to do. I feel like a schmuck. He has such pretty words. The seeker feels a sense of relief as the supporter knows about the situation and it is not a breakup conversation.	labels:From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen..
text:And he invests so much time and effort into us. I agree with you. My mind agrees. My stupid emotions are clouding things. The seeker feels like a schmuck and wants to know what to do. The supporter should let the seeker know that she is safe and not alone with her feelings. 	labels:Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?.
text:I did. LOL. The seeker feels like a schmuck. The supporter could tell the seeker that her feelings are not wrong.	labels:And he's still married?.
text:And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house) That was two weeks ago. So, yes, he is. Too soon to tell. The seeker feels alone, stressed, and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of friends around her.	labels:I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?.
text:I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner. The seeker feels betrayed because of the guy's lies. The supporter should help the seeker to focus on the problem at hand. The supporter can give a suggestion to the seeker to take some time to think about and make a decision.	labels:It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already..
text:That's not an easy question to answer. He treats me very well. Always has. And he is frantically trying to accomodate me, now htat I know. I agree with you. It's one of my fears. The seeker is still stuck over whether to give her boyfriend time to prove himself or not. The supporter could let her know that it is not for them to decide.	labels:How do your children feel about this? And his?.
text:MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six. This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too. His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out. The seeker feels hurt and cheated upon, but the supporter tries to calm the seeker and help her get her emotions under control.	labels:Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt.
text:It's a messed up situation that COVID has not improved. He was furloughed in May. Indeed I don't, you're right. The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely. The supporter should ask more questions to the seeker to figure out the reason for the seeker's stress.	labels:I hear you. Covid has disrupted the whole world so might this year! I can't wait for it to be over..
text:But now it seems like it will hurt them if I break up with him. The seeker feels lonely, stressed out and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to look for ways to make her feel less lonely.	labels:But it will hurt them more the longer the situation goes on :(.
text:I wish I could say that I were confident that 2021 would be better, but... Too right. And this is all a part of why this is not a simple situation. The seeker is feeling lonely, sad, worried and confused. The supporter can see that the seeker is struggling with this issue. The supporter can find another topic for the seeker to talk about like the fact that she is feeling lonely.	labels:Well it surely could not be worse :)
text:I have no doubt that he loves me very much. Hahahaha! Seems that way. He didn't make this lie up for me. That's an interesting thing. He was living the "divorced dad" lie to A LOT of people. Anybody and everybody who was far enough away to be lied to. She lives in her bedroom. Only comes out to work two nights a week. DOesn't want to have anything to do with her kids (5, 9, 11, 13) The seeker feels sad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:(sorry was afk let me catch up)
text:And she and my BF have been living that way for three years. Over a year before I even met him. The seeker feels sad for her kids. The supporter should ask her if she has talked to her kids about this.	labels:Is it possible she is suffering from depression?.
text:I would all but guarantee it. The seeker feels lonely, lonely, sad and upset that her boyfriend has a new girlfriend. The supporter asks the seeker if she is lonely and if she wants to talk about it.	labels:It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position.
text:Here's the other kicker, though... She knows about me. (I know. You're right. I thought that as well) The seeker feels stressed and lonely. She doesn't know why she's stressed but she knows she is lonely. The supporter should ask about the reason for the stress.	labels:And how does she feel about you?.
text:She doesn't care. She just wants to keep the status quo. She likes the money and security. (before he was furloughed, he made very good money.) The seeker feels lonely, stressed, and hopeless. The supporter could empathise with the seeker and tell her that there will always be people in her life who love her.	labels:I think it would be better if he  were able to come to a sensible financial solution with her. This situation is damaging for everyone..
text:Yes! I agree! EVERYBODY! The seeker feels lonely, stressed and worried. It is complicated, and the supporter is helping her get a better perspective.	labels:I hope I have been able to have been of some help to you :) A very happy New Year to you!.

text:thank you, I just don't know what else to do to get a job? The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could focus on what makes her feel good and make her happy.	labels:So you're unemployed? I am sorry to hear that. Are you prepared to take jobs that are below your usual level just to get by for a while?.
text:have tried that but don't even get an interview. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:It's a very difficult time to be out of work, I know. I hope that there is something out there for you. Have you tried employment agencies?.
text:yes, I do not qualify for unemployment because I have savings above the min threshold and I also have rental property, which is currently loss making and I can't sell it because it's 30% below market value. The seeker feels lonely and worry about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should be supportive and make her feel she has people around her.	labels:Well, on the plus side at least you do have savings .. hopefully this can give you some security for a while. Are your family being supportive of your situation?.
text:it's almost depleted, been out of work now for nearly 9 months but still can't get unemployment support because of the property that I cannot get rid off else I will declared bankrupt by the mortgage lender. The seeker feels lonely, stressed and down. The supporter could cheer her up by saying something like, "I am so sorry to hear about your unemployment. I know it's hard to be out of work. I don't know what else to say, but I hope you can find something to help you."	labels:Perhaps bankruptcy might not be a bad option? You would be eligible for some help then at least..
text:family is not being fully supported compared to when I had full time job. had to get rid of one car and other things just to get by. but the cost is 7 years of my future??? The seeker feels lonely, depressed, stressed and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend.	labels:So you feel as though you have been working hard all your life and now you need help and support and are not getting it.
text:very well put. seems i am being penalised for working hard, saving and investing? I should have been on more holidays and lived all the way above my means! The seeker feels lonely and worried. She feels she is being penalised for working hard and saving. The supporter should ask the seeker to consider the fact that she has not been able to continue her work and saving to pay for her housing.	labels:I know how you feel .. I sometimes feel I would have been better off if I'd just not bothered working!. Anyway thank you for talking and I really hope things go better for you in the future :).

The seeker feels lonely and upset at the behaviour her ex is showing. The supporter could ask the seeker to think about what she wants and how she can get it.	labels:You tried to do the right thing and they are having a difficult time letting go. The ongoing comments through social media sounds like they are wanting your attention. That can be exhausting for you. In my past, I had to block someone who did something similar to me. If my friends mentioned seeing something from my ex about me, I asked them to keep it to themselves or consider blocking them,too. The people who were closest to me understood what was going on and I realized that people who didn’t know me, didn’t matter. Would you be willing to suggest this to friends or family if it would help to remove the ex from your interactions?

The supporter could tell the seeker that she is trying hard to be a good listener.	labels:I can sense your frustration. It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue.  Do you think that might help?
text:I think that is an excellent idea! That is a good way to end this once and for all. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could help the seeker by creating a letter for the ex to send to the seeker.	labels:I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control  over how you are able to interact with people.

text:Not so good. I have conspiracy theorist as a friend who is now mad at me because I told her to pull up her mask while talking to me. We have been friends for 13 years. I am hurt and confused that she still thinks this is a game. She thought Corona was fake until someone we know caught it. It is like she is mad she was wrong and is taking it out and lashing out at those who have been trying to persuade her the whole time... what do you think? The seeker is confused and hurt by her friend's behaviour. The supporter could show empathy and offer positive feedback.	labels:It sounds like you care a lot about your friend and others.

When you say your friend does not believe in the virus, what is her stance on it?
text:She thought it was faked for political reasons at first. Then when she found out it was real when it struck close to home, she is saying it is apart of population control. Honestly she is all over the place. I find her very dangerous to others right now. I don't think our friendship will survive this because I am willing to part ways for all of our safety. I hate that but will do it.\ The seeker feels sad and lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts. As my friends started working on those units and my members being hospitalized for it, I surrendered my political stance and dawned my mask. I have a friend who is just like your friend, they have politicized it and had first degree exposure and blew up when we had her sit out of our teen support group/youth group and church services for two weeks. She is in her 50's. I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts.

Have you spoken to her about it at all, or is that not your jam? It's ok. A lot of people are non-confrontational. Society tells us we should be able to express our boundaries. Not everyone is comfortable with that and that is ok.

I was with someone who, although we had great fun together, he couldn't be with me as much as I wanted him to. And it made me feel bad. Because it brought up feelings from when I was growing up and neglected. It took a long time, and it ...wasn't a clean break. I just got tired of feeling bad, and the relationship just waned.. Take the time you need, but you can take control, if you want to.

For example, I am in college and if I have to write a 8 page paper, I push myself to write at least 1 page every day until I finish. Then I have enough time to edit and make the deadline. Another suggestion is to remind yourself why you need to wake up and get things going! For me, I know I want to help others in the future but without the degree I am going for, I would not be able to help.

The supporter should try to comfort the seeker and encourage her to continue with her education.	labels:Wow I can only imagine. But I think it wasn't a waste if there were good times and you had room to grow. In relationships you have to prioritize your own happiness and I'm sure if you mentioned that you're frustrated and hurt maybe you can understand how she feels and why she made the decisions she made.

The supporter could empathize with the seeker and ask for more details.	labels:Absolutely not! Individual frustrations are the best things to focus on before everything that happens in the world..

The supporter could encourage the seeker to remember those days she hurt her friend and to forgive him.	labels:Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.  Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.

I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them. The seeker feels lonely and sad, but the supporter helps her to feel hopeful that her friend will come back.	labels:Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.
text:No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to help her feel being loved.	labels:I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues.. Have you other friends?
text:True. It's hard to connect with people after high school. The mindset of high school is make friends and the mindset of adulthood is survival. No, not now. I am married though. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has friends and would be glad to connect with her.	labels:Yes, and as you grow and mature, your life goals change, not everyone will travel with you. Right now you are starting out, I'm in the retired stage, lol Now I'm interested in helping younger people. It's amazing how our priorities change..
text:Yeah some people just don't want to do anything in their lives... The seeker is stressed, and the supporter should ask why? The supporter could also tell the seeker to focus on her son and some ways she can reach out to her son.	labels:I've basically figured out life only makes sense with God, and I don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it.  A LOT of people have no goals. I think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year.  I think self reflection is good for us..
text:This year has been a great test for us all and a call to faith. The seeker is a Christian, the supporter could have told the seeker about God, how He is in control of all things and He will provide a way for all things.	labels:A young neighbor just stopped by today, and he just moved out of his home, he is consumed with HOW do I pay the electric, HOW do I budget? How do I cook?  lol Like it is so interesting to see the journey in life. And my faith in Jesus Christ is really the most important thing.. Do pray for your friend, and I will say a prayer too. Maybe he will come around some day?
text:Maybe I've tried to reach him but then I just wanted to be his friend. But I can't even do that. The seeker wants to be alone, but she feels lonely. The supporter can encourage the seeker to talk to her husband, as he is also lonely.	labels:I had two brothers die from alcohol and drugs. I had to learn not to enable them. Sadly, people choose their own life. There is opportunity to get sober, my husband is a recovered alcoholic.  When hanging with them and they do not want to change, sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away and let them hit bottom.  I have 2 brothers that DID find recover and a sister too. So my whole life was filled with people drinking and drugging. And I didn't want that life..
text:Neither do I. I feel so much better. Thank you. The seeker feels lonely and wants to be helped. The supporter could help the seeker by sharing from his/her experience, and ask the seeker, if he/she had any other friends who were similar to the best friend?	labels:there's a prayer called the serenity prayer, I don't know if you are familiar with it, but it is used in AA and NA a lot, learning to let go of what we cannot change, and that is people,	episode_done:True

The supporter could ask the seeker about what she is struggling with.	labels:Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?
text:My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months. The seeker feels the anger and sadness, but the supporter should not let the seeker express the anger. They should ask for more details.	labels:So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?
text:Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial. The seeker feels angry and sad because of the lies and micromanaging. The supporter could also ask more questions and give some tips to the seeker.	labels:Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all... Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?
text:I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit. The seeker feels stressed and lonely.. She feels lonely because she has a hard time trusting people. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has many friends and she isn't alone.	labels:That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.
text:I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms). The seeker feels sad and disappointed in her employer. The supporter could remind the seeker that all employees have the right to transfer within the same department.	labels:That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background..
text:I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but  their values are not walked out. I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a "start today" option. The seeker feels bitter, frustrated and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is in a good position to make a good opportunity for herself.	labels:I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..
text:Sure links are always helpful (for the record, I left the employer and work for fabulous healthcare company now that I have been with for two years). Do you run during the winter when it is cold, or do you have different coping strategies for the winter time. It is 8 degrees where I am at. The seeker is feeling stressed about her situation at work and she is very depressed. The supporter should ask her about her emotions and then help her find ways to cope with her situation.	labels:I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever. Wow that is cold.. I could not run in that what so ever...Do you have a gym?	episode_done:True

The seeker feels guilty. The supporter could ask the seeker why she feels guilty. The supporter could also ask her friend why she is putting the seeker on a guilt trip.	labels:well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation.
text:I am not making much income with the COVID-19, either. The seeker feels pressured and not being supported. The supporter should talk about the positive actions they can make to support the seeker.	labels:it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you.
text:Two different (so-called) friends of mine need to get a life. The seeker feels lonely but not sure why. The supporter should ask the seeker if there is anything he/she can do to feel better.	labels:shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing.
text:Yeah, people don't know that just because my two friends go "Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two (so-called) friends?. The seeker feels lonely and the supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:definatly not  ...have you tried explaining your situation to them?
text:No, they don't know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID-19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter should explain the situation in detail.	labels:well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?
text:I might be able to do that. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter asks the seeker to think about the person who is shaming her. The supporter suggests that the two friends should not shame her, but the supporter also suggests that the seeker should try to help the organization with donating her time.	labels:unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that,
text:Well, I used to donate a LOT in year's past. The seeker feels embarrassed about her financial situation.	labels:a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money.
text:Great point. The seeker is feeling sad about her financial situation, but the supporter does not know that. The supporter should ask the seeker more about what is causing her stress and to ask about her friends.	labels:times and situations change so thats ok.
text:My friends may like to know that I am trading time....instead of donating money. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason for being lonely is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker if she has any problem in her life or if the loneliness is caused by other people.	labels:i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out.
text:Yes, you make a good point. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter should tell the seeker that she cannot help the situation. The supporter should encourage the seeker to focus on her son with his new family.	labels:I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not.
text:The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that he/she is not alone.	labels:Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality  we don't know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect.
text:I need to think of others ways to contribute that won't have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend, but the supporter is not sure what to do about the seeker.	labels:BUt it should be what you want not what your 'freinds want. you should be proud of yourself.
text:Yeah...... The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life.
text:The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well-to-do individual. We can only hope for a better 2021. Not sure how quickly the markets rebound.... The seeker feels lonely because of the loss of money from COVID-19	labels:well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy.
text:Well, I usually go to their get-togethers. Both of my friends are well-to-do. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that people are all different and should not be judged by what they are doing. The supporter could also point out that the friends are not real friends, but rather just going after money.	labels:I am hoping you will find the right solution.
text:Well, you have been helpful. Thank you. Good bye. The seeker feels lonely with her situation. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are always ways to make her feel loved.	labels:thanks I wish you all the luck and health. good bye.

text:What suggestions do you have for unruly kids who argue when their parent need quiet in their respective offices because we work at home? Yelling does not work. The seeker 's parents are in their office and need quiet, but the seeker's kids think of yelling. The supporter could remind the seeker that quiet will work and should be used.	labels:Have you tried to talk to your kids about that?
text:I'm thinking of taking away devices, but then Corona is still here. I feel that is very mean considering they are already stressed being in doors. Talking is great when we are doing it and they all agree. But it never stays this way. The seeker is a supporter. She wants to make the supporter feel like she is important and needs to be heard, but the other person is always interrupting.	labels:Maybe that will be a good thing because it might make them wished they had listened to you and won't do it again,
text:I almost feel like crying. I hear you but.... The seeker feels frustrated and sad about her kids. She wants to discuss the cause of the problem and some options for resolving the problem. The supporter should ask for more details to understand what is going on in the seeker's life.	labels:Everything will be okay. Try to talk to them and be very firm with them.
text:I feel that is abusive when I know how bad they are being affected psychologically. I actually feel like just locking them in their rooms until we get done working. Kind of like being grounded.... I will try to talk with them again. I know I will probably be tearful which I know bothers them. The seeker feels guilty and ashamed. The supporter can support the seeker by reassuring her that she is not being mean.	labels:How about reward them with something if they listen and behave.
text:Maybe they will react to that... I'm so glad the vaccine is here\ Thats a better idea.... The seeker feels lonely, depressed and feels like crying. The supporter should point out the seeker's emotions.	labels:Don't get to hard on yourself everything will be okay.
text:I appreciate your support and maybe I will take them to the park where we all play family games but just with us four. They really love to do that. I think that they want attention from us more because we are right here. Or maybe we'll have a picnic together. It has been awhile since we have done something outside of the house together. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the breakup with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should focus on herself and think of the things in her life that bring her happiness.	labels:Yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside.
text:I feel it is like pent up frustration. They were very very busy before Corona. The seeker agrees that the supporter should be firm with the children.

I hope you have an awesome christmas and please stay safe! The seeker feels stressed and lonely.

The supporter might say, "you are not alone in feeling like that, lots of people have had to say goodbye to their beloved pets."	labels:Oh ok how did your dog die was something wrong with him or just old age?
text:She was old, blind and was getting dog dementia. I had to have her put to sleep. The seeker is lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could help the seeker by telling the seeker the have people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I am really sorry that has got to be the worst feeling putting your dog to sleep.
text:It is. At least I was able to be with her so she wasn't afraid. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker about the new puppy that was born and how cute it is. This will help the seeker feel better.	labels:I just think of it this way your dog is in dog heaven and is watching over you that is how i think of it even though it really aint true thats just how i think. My dog died of old age. it took me like 2 or 3 weeks to get over it and not cry for once.
text:I just miss her. I believe she is with her brother. He died 7 years ago. He was hit by a car. I can understand that. The seeker feels lonely and worried about being alone. The supporter should let her know about the people around her.	labels:I can understand how you feeling but everything will be okay and it is ok to miss her.
text:I was doing pretty good then there was this dog in the movie and I just broke down again. The seeker is upset that the supporter doesn't know what movie the seeker watched. The supporter should ask more questions.	labels:I understand I would break down to if I saw that. Just do something you like to do to get your mind off of it.
text:It helps to have a person to talk to. I used this chat Hit before right after I had to put her to sleep. The person I talked to then had a dog too. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could understand that the seeker is going through a tough time. The supporter could also understand that when the seeker is feeling sad, she needs someone to talk to. A supporter could also recommend the seeker to talk to her friends about her feelings.	labels:Right it is always good to have someone to talk to in a situation like that.
text:It's a good Idea to do something to get my mind off of it. The seeker feels sad and lonely because she lost her dog. The supporter could encourage the seeker to do something that she likes to do.	labels:Just by expressing your feelings with someone will help a lot to.
text:Yes it helps. The seeker feels lonely and feels like she needs to see a movie that has a dog in it. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is a dog that the supporter knows has died to make her feel better.	labels:Maybe you can watch a comedy movie or another kind of movie to get your mind off of it.
text:That sounds like a good idea. A comedy probably would help. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend, and the supporter should explain she has a friend who is like her and she will be there for her.	labels:yes it would help. Keep your head up and know your dog is dog heaven and not suffering anymore.
text:Okay. Thanks for talking. Goodnight. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to think of her nephew.	labels:your welcome goodnight.	episode_done:True

text:My spouse wants me to allow him to have a cheat day during Christmas. The seeker feels lonely, frustrated and worried about her spouse being unfaithful.

text:Basically he wants to sleep with someone else for a change. The seeker feels that her spouse wants to cheat. The supporter can understand the seeker's feeling and try to talk to the seeker about things that are going on and what she can do to feel better.	labels:let me get you right, you mean you guy want to cheat on and he told you about it.
text:yes he wants me to know so that he doesn't feel guilty about it. The seeker feels lonely and wants to know if the supporter has a plan to help her feel being loved. The supporter could tell the seeker to look at her own life and try to be more positive about it.	labels:wow, that will be tough on you because even if you said no, he might just do it without telling you.
text:Exactly.... he said I can do it behind your back without you ever knowing but I would rather be honest with you. The seeker is shocked that her spouse want to cheat on her during the holiday season.	labels:i can feel your anger and disappointment. my ex cheated on me before and it hurts like hell. my ex cheated on me before and it hurts like hell.
text:I told him I don't want that to happen but he offered whatever I wanted no matter the price and all I could think was I just want him to be faithful. He told me not to take it personally because it is just lust and that he loves me only. The seeker is very angry and disappointed. The supporter should understand what the seeker feels and help him or her understand.	labels:since when have you guys been together.
text:Actually, today is our 4th year anniversary. The seeker feels lonely because she is in a relationship with her husband. The supporter could remind the seeker that there are people in the room to help her.	labels:that's a long time..
text:Yes I guess he just wants a change. The seeker feel like she have to give up her marriage because her husband wants to cheat. The supporter can tell the seeker that she does not have to give up her marriage.	labels:have you guys seen a therapist.
text:No but I am thinking about i. it* The seeker feels sad, disappointed and angry. The supporter could tell the seeker that by talking about the mistake, the seeker will have a chance to get over it and move on.	labels:every relationship has it's ups and down, just make sure you guys talk to an expert and make reason out of this .. therapy has help my relationship a great deal.
text:I will definitely look into it. You are a great listener and I feel better now that I spoke to someone about this issue. The seeker feels lonely and disappointed. The supporter could ask the seeker to tell the supporter how she feels.	labels:good, and make sure you are not too visibly angry at him for telling you. just help him trough the process.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there and Happy Holidays! I hope you are feeling okay at the moment?.\nI am not, this is a very hard time of the year for me. The seeker feels so lonely and stressed. The supporter can help the seeker by telling about his support in his life.	labels:I am really sorry to hear that. Please know that I am happy to listen and to help you if I can!.
text:Thank you for that.  I really miss my girlfriend. The seeker feels lonely and sad. She is a little sad, but is trying to ignore it. The supporter should ask the seeker what is going on in her life that is making her feel this way.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. Have you separated or can you just not be together at Christmas?.
text:We are separated.  She said I was watching too much Buzzr and didn't pay enough attention to her, so she dumped me. The seeker does not feel lonely and worried. The supporter should be listening and give some good feedback.	labels:That is not good. But relationships can be reestablished if you talk. Have you considered seeing a third party to help you both talk this out?.
text:We tried to see a counselor.  It did go too well, the counselor took her side on everything, it was very unprofessional. The seeker feels sad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could help the seeker to see where she could be hurt in this situation.	labels:I seem, so do I hear you saying that you feel that everyone is against you on this and that you feel powerless?.
text:It feels like that way.  Even my parents seem to support her more than me.  I am all alone now watching a Buzzr marathon with no one to truly support me. The seeker feels helpless and feels the whole world is against her. The supporter should try to work with the seeker to find solutions to these issues instead of just telling her to feel better or to move on.	labels:I am sorry that your parents are not being more supportive. I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex!.
text:Has this happened to you before? The seeker feels like she is alone and unsupported. The supporter should make sure that the seeker feels that she is supported and loved. The supporter should have encouraged the seeker to talk to a counselor.	labels:Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.. Yes it has .. my boyfriend left me for someone else and most of our mutual friends took his side!.
text:I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person. The seeker feels lonely, sad and worried about the break up. The supporter should focus on helping the seeker feel loved, supported and hopeful for the future.	labels:Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her.
text:That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could ask the seeker to focus on the positive and how to make her life better.	labels:That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem..
text:I agree.  You know, you are very good at this.  Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband? The seeker feels alone and feels that she will be better off without her boyfriend. The supporter should try to encourage the seeker and support her to move on.	labels:Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could!.
text:Well that is a good success story!  Thank you for the motivation. The seeker feels lonely and worried about losing her boyfriend. The supporter asks the seeker if anyone has helped her before, and suggests that the seeker could get some more support, and maybe from a third party.	labels:Maybe you should think about talking to a counsellor or something about this, just to work through your feelings?.
text:Yes I will do that.  Thank you for your support. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter makes her feel less lonely by letting her know that she is not alone.	labels:You are most welcome. I have a few minutes left to talk if there's anything else on your mind?. How is life treating you otherwise?.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\nHi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better. The seeker feels sad and lonely. She wants to turn her focus to a positive mindset.	labels:So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?
text:Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. The seeker is stressed because of school, but not because of anything specific. The supporter should help the seeker to figure out what is stressing her out about school and what she can do to try to make herself feel better.	labels:I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?
text:I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot. The seeker feels lonely and sad and is not sure how to cheer herself up. The supporter can help the seeker by giving her positive conversation strategies such as using positive self-talk and focusing on how she is doing at school.	labels:Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.
text:Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker she has a lot of exams coming up and she needs to study and take breaks.	labels:Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
text:Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. The seeker feels stressed due to a lot of work and exams. The supporter could show the seeker some ways to help her feel better during the holidays.	labels:Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.
text:Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. The seeker feels stressed and has a problem with procrastination. The supporter could encourage the seeker to think about the goals she has written down and to reward herself.	labels:Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *
text:I have 6 classes. The seeker feels lonely and isolated. The supporter can tell the seeker there are positive things in her life to provide a sense of support.	labels:That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart..
text:Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you! Have a great day and thanks again. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask the seeker what she is feeling lonely for.	labels:You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today? Hello? Anyone there?\nHi sorry. I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?
text:In about a month. The seeker feels ashamed of the work she has been doing, so she feels lazy trying to finish it. The supporter could tell her that she is a good worker and that she should have pride in her accomplishments.	labels:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.. Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?
text:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her. The seeker feels that she will need to spend more time with her advisor to make sure she meets the deadline. The supporter can encourage the seeker to be good about keeping in touch with her advisor.	labels:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.
text:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.
text:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could encourage the seeker to break down the project into small steps. They should also encourage the seeker to take breaks and don't be afraid to ask for help.	labels:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that. You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.. That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable..
text:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused. The seeker feels like she is a perfectionist but finds herself in a slump. She needs to learn to be more realistic with her goals. The supporter should encourage the seeker to make a realistic goal for herself.	labels:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.
text:My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable. The seeker feels stressed and depressed and that the supporter has no idea what the support seeker is going through. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!.
text:I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake. The seeker feels lonely and stressed and the supporter can notice the seeker's situation. The supporter can try to encourage the seeker to have a positive attitude.	labels:It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!
text:That sounds like a wonderful feeling. But so far away. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter should ask about the reasons why the seeker is stressed.	labels:My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards..
text:That's a very poetic way of putting it. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could say the that the reason for these emotions are not mentioned.	labels:Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at..
text:I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help. The seeker feels stressed and lonely and the supporter can make suggestions for the supporter to talk to the seeker about the stress and loneliness.	labels:I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success.. You are very welcome. Have a blessed evening!!.	episode_done:True
text:Good evening, how are you feeling today?.\nI am feeling okay I am kind of stressed. How are you? The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could tell the seeker she has many friends to help her. The supporter could also tell the seeker to focus on the things in her life that don't make her feel lonely, and she could help.	labels:I am sorry, I gather life is not going well for you right now? Would you like to talk about it?.
text:Yes I would. The seeker feels lonely and wants to talk about it. The supporter should be honest, gentle and understanding. 	labels:I am more than happy to listen and to help if I can. I do know how bad things can get at this time of year..
text:I am sad and even depressed about my life at the moment its hard to find a job and I am scared to open myself up to this guy I met. The seeker is depressed and scared about meeting someone. The supporter should listen to the seeker, and then tell the seeker that she has no reason to be worried, and that she should focus on what she has at the moment, and that she can open up and take risks.	labels:Let's take things one at a time .. have you lost your job recently?.
text:No. it is hard finding one. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could ask the seeker if she wants to talk about her feelings and how she is feeling.	labels:Yes, I can understand that jobs are very hard to come by right now.
text:Yes they are but I at least have friends to talk to for help. The seeker feels sad and depressed. The supporter can give the seeker some suggestions to cheer up.	labels:Well that is one positive thing. Can you tell me a little about the guy you are afraid to open up to?.
text:Well I met him on a dating site and he lives in France but he is also turkish i dont know much about turkish men but he says he loves me and he sees something with me but i barely know we only talking for few weeks now. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could ask the seeker if there is anyone else she can talk to. The supporter could encourage the seeker to open up to the relationship.	labels:Well, I would recommend not taking things too quickly but relationships online CAN work - I met my fiance of ten years online..
text:oh that is wonderful. The seeker is feeling lonely and anxious, and the supporter can tell the seeker to talk to someone about the problem.	labels:But we did take it very slowly and talked for a year before we met in person..
text:i told him i dont want to rush things he fine with taking things slow but he does want me to take a chance with him. im 23 and he is 27 he is a positive sweet guy currently he is battling covid. The seeker is scared to date someone online because she is afraid of being scammed. The supporter tells her she has nothing to worry about because she met her fiance online.	labels:Well, if he is reliable then he will be happy to wait till you are ready to meet. Where do you live, do you mind me asking?.
text:I live in America and he live in France. The seeker is feeling overwhelmed and depressed. The supporter should help the seeker to express her feeling better.	labels:Ah well definitely do not contemplate meeting him whilst the pandemic is on! But it might be  good excuse to put things off for a bit, do you think?.
text:I would not be comfortable going to france during a pandemic I want to wait until everyone gets vaccinated first. The seeker feels like she has something to tell the supporter and the supporter understand. But the supporter wants to know more about the seeker's fear.	labels:I do think that it might be a while before travel in Europe fully opens up again. Things are not good here..
text:u live in europe? The seeker is feeling stressed with the news from Nashville, the supporter ask about the reasons the seeker feeling stressed.  And the supporter can tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I am in the UK. The pandemic is very bad here at the moment..
text:yeah I heard it is another strain there. The seeker meets with the supporter and discuss the reason for her loneliness. The supporter gives her suggestions to make her feel better.	labels:Two more! It's very scary and I don't recommend coming either here or continental Europe right now..
text:he understands that im not meeting him no time soon but when the pandemic is over I do not know if I should continue to pursue him or not. I dont even have a passport and i care about my health and others im not traveling for a long time. The seeker feels lonely and thinks she has a chance to meet a sweet man and the supporter should make her feel less lonely.	labels:So, I hear you saying that you are a bit wary of the relationship and do not know if it can work in the real world?.
text:Yes because I do not have experience with Turkish men and I am scared of him being controlling and abusive I guess its due to sterotypes i read about and heard. The seeker is very hesitant about meeting the boyfriend, but the supporter could tell the seeker that the boyfriend is a sweet guy who will wait till the pandemic is over to meet her.	labels:Turkish people are lovely and welcoming - you should not worry about that :). But don't let yourself be pushed into anything you don't feel ready for.
text:Yes I agree with u have u met any turkish people? The seeker feels lonely, depressed and stressed about her relationship. The supporter asks her how she feels about the situation and she can feel the supporter is supportive.	labels:Yes I know a few Turkish people. They're very nice people, don't listen to any stereotypes!.
text:I think its also due to me being hurt before but scared of trying something new giving a new person a chance I have major trust issues. The seeker is feeling stressed and depressed about the news from Nashville. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:I do understand how trying new things can be very difficult - this is something that I struggle with myself. But - if you don't take a chance, how can you know what might have happened?.
text:Yes I agree with u there. The seeker feels lonely and depressed, but the supporter can help her feel happy and confident. The supporter should ask the seeker if she would like to know more about Turkish people and help her find some online.	labels:I really hope that I have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through. I wish you a very happy holiday season!.

Can you hit quit and take the survey? :).	episode_done:True
text:hellohow are you today.\nNot great. I'm feeling pretty down in the dumps. The seeker feels lonely because of the news from Nashville. The supporter could tell the seeker that they have a lot to be happy about.	labels:Im sorry to hear that. how can I help.
text:I'm not sure how, exactly. I'm dealing with repeated rejections. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter could focus on how she is going to get through this.	labels:That is always tough especially during this time of year and been there myself. What type of rejection  are you experiencing.
text:Romantic rejection. It seems like every time I make an effort, it's immediately shot down. The seeker is lonely and stressed. The supporter can tell the seeker there are people around to make her feel loved.	labels:I hate to ask you this but are you male or female?
text:Male. Why do you ask? The seeker is a male person.	labels:I ask it changes the perception on how I may help you because male and females deal with things differently.
text:Fair enough. What do you suggest I try? The seeker is male and is experiencing romantic rejection. The supporter can help the seeker think of alternatives to romantic rejection.	labels:I am going to ask you a few questions if OK i don't want to sound like i am prying.
text:That's fine. I'm open to discussion. The seeker thinks the supporter is prying. The supporter should ask for direct communication which will encourage the seeker to talk.	labels:OK do yo live in a rural or city, are you into male females or the like?
text:I'm in a rural area, and I'm interested in women. The seeker seems open to the supporter. The supporter should ask the seeker to give out some information that is not shared in the conversation. This way, the supporter will gain more information to help the seeker.	labels:I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection.
text:I've had to resort to online dating and such as there are few opportunities to meet people in person. The seeker has struggled to find a partner and the supporter could ask the seeker to think about her needs.	labels:I understand doing that I have tried it myself and trying to find that connection is few and far between. What sites have you tried using?
text:Basically all of the ones you would expect. How would you suggest meeting people in person? The seeker is lonely because the supporter did not offer any suggestions. I think the supporter should offer the seeker some suggestions.	labels:Well It would depend on if you were religious I  would suggest church functions for example. I use my hobbies like pool and darts and cards and join groups that creates some common ground.
text:That sounds like a good idea. Do you attend meetups? The seeker is interested in meeting people in person. The supporter could suggest that there are clubs that are open to meeting people with like interests.	labels:I have and i usually take someone i  trust with me and if it doesnt feel right I leave.
text:That's good advice. Thanks for your help. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. She could find a new hobby to relieve stress.	labels:No problem glad I could help. Is there anything else I can help with?	episode_done:True

text:Yes. I had to throw out my sister the other day and Im kind of upset over it. The seeker is talking about her sister and the supporter should help her.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. What precipitated that, had you been having problems for a while?.
text:She was in a psych ward for a while and when it was time to discharge her, my mother didnt want her back. She was going to send her to a foster home so I volunteered to take her in. Since then, she has stopped taking her medication and is acting out. The seeker felt lonely and sad. However, the supporter helped her to feel better by telling her she is not alone.	labels:Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?.
text:Pretty much. The seeker feels lonely and she is not sure if her sister is going to get better or not. The supporter could tell the seeker that she might feel lonely and sad because she is not a parent and is not responsible for her sister.	labels:I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is..

The supporter can sympathise and find the reason for her sadness.	labels:Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it.

The seeker feels lonely and worried about her sister. The supporter can help the seeker in how to deal with the situation.	labels:That sounds very toxic.

The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. In this conversation, the supporter could help the seeker to understand the complex issue she has been dealing with. The supporter could tell the seeker to be patient with her mother.	labels:Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it?

text:I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end. The seeker is feeling lonely and is upset about her sister and mother.

The seeker feels very lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is a good person and that she can help the seeker overcome her loneliness.	labels:Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise..
text:I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day. The seeker feels lonely and hurt and the supporter should acknowledge that. The supporter should also tell the seeker not to be sad and that she can move on.	labels:Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away.
text:Yes, but she denies it whole heartedly. This is why she was taking medication. The seeker feels stressed because of the news from Nashville and she is worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is fine and not to worry about this issue. The supporter could also ask what she is feeling and how she could be helped.	labels:I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem..
text:I just wish she could she what I see... The seeker is upset and her father is telling her that she should not blame herself for the situation. In this case, the supporter should have asked for more details about the situation and the seeker would have revealed the reason why she feels lonely. The supporter should have encouraged the seeker to get in touch with her family again.	labels:Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her.
text:I was afraid she was going to ruin my family with her attitudes. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could encourage the seeker to be positive.	labels:I hope that I have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me.

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you considered getting some sort of marriage guidance counselling? There are people out there who might be able to help you both.
text:Why would we need counseling to spice up a love life?  That should come naturally, is it hard for women to make that change? The seeker wants to know if there is a way to spice up the love-making, the reason is that she is afraid of losing her husband.	labels:I think it sounds as though you might be pushing her into things she is not ready for though.

text:That is what makes me sad, I know I am the problem.  I am a piece of trash, she is way better than me.    I hate myself. The seeker feels sad and wants to make a change in her marriage. The supporter should tell her that she is not the problem, and that she is a good wife.

At least you recognise that you are not behaving well, which is the first step on the road to making things better..
text:Maybe I have a sex addiction.  I think I watch too much pornography and it gives me weird ideas for sex. The seeker feels sad and lonely as she says she is sad and lonely. The supporter might mention some things that the seeker can do to feel better.	labels:Perhaps you could consider individual counselling to overcome your own problems before you think of couples' therapy?. Porn can be helpful for a relationship but it can also be damaging..
text:Just for me?  I hope I get a male counselor because if it was a female one, I would probably want to sleep with her. The seeker is not happy with her husband's sexuality and wants to seek help. If the supporter can encourage the seeker to seek help on her own, it could be a good conversation.	labels:Well, perhaps it would be better for you to learn that you can't just do that even though you want to :).
text:Yes, I can't control my impulses.  I am picturing what you look like now and imagining what we would do together.  I think I have a big problem. The seeker does admit that she is sad and lonely. The supporter should encourage the seeker to admit her problems and work on the issues.	labels:I am forty five, fat and married :). I do recommend talking to someone though..

text:Thank you for the ideas. But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? The seeker is feeling stressed, but the supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment.

text:Well, thanks for your input.  I think this chat has been helpful.  I am a proud American! Good bye. The seeker is sad and feels like a loser. The supporter should encourage the seeker to keep her chin up and focus on the future and the brighter days.	labels:It does wear off, but if you get into a routine of doing it, it will help to alleviate some of that sadness. Ok thank you I hope things get going in the right direction for you. Merry Christmas!	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nI'm really upset about a break up I just had with my boyfriend. The seeker feels upset. The supporter should ask the seeker to explain her feelings in more detail.	labels:I am sorry, when did this happen?
text:It happened two days ago.  I can't believe he led me on for almost a year knowing that I had two children and all of a sudden decided that he didn't want to deal with kids. The seeker is upset, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:I can understand the pain you must feel and the betrayal, that is absolutely awful.
text:I do.  I don't understand why he was fine with my kids for almost a  year and all of a sudden it changed.  I'm completely blindsided. The seeker feels upset, but the supporter can help her focus on the good things in her life.	labels:How are your children doing through this?
text:They don't know yet.  I didn't want to upset them right before Christmas. The seeker is going through a difficult time. She is looking for positive things to help her. The supporter should try to give her more information about her children.	labels:What a terrible thing for him to do. I agree with you not to upset them right before Christmas.
text:I'm not really sure how to break it to them when I do finally tell them. The seeker feels lonely and upset that her boyfriend has cheated on her. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do. Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings.
text:That is a good idea.  That would be good so they don't think it has anything to do with them because I'd never want them to feel bad about it! The seeker feels lonely, but the reason for the loneliness is not mentioned in the conversation.  The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Exactly, that is a burden that children should never have to endure. They are always the innocent victims in our personal problems.
text:Hopefully they don't ask me what choices he made and want details. The seeker has already been told that she is not alone. It is a good time to tell the supporter that her children are doing fine.  They should feel proud of their mother. The supporter can tell the seeker to focus on more positive thoughts.	labels:True! How old are they?
text:They are 6 and 8 years old. The seeker feels lonely, hurt and betrayed. She is worried about telling her children about their father. The supporter could also give advice about how to tell the children about their father.	labels:They should hopefully be young enough not to want details. Maybe if they ask say he didn't give you details because he apparently doesn't know himself what he wants. You sound like a very caring mother who wants the very best for her children.
text:thank you! Knowing someone thinks I'm a good mother makes me feel a little better about the situation! The seeker feels lonely and stressed with the break up. The supporter could tell the seeker she has friends who can be a source of comfort.	labels:I have a daughter and we have went through something similar in the past so I can relate. The truth is, I have found over time that it is our children who get us through these tough time.
text:Yes, seeing their faces tomorrow when they open presents will help get me through this sad time! The seeker feels lonely and down. The supporter should listen to the conversation and tell the seeker she is not alone.	labels:You will get through this and come out ahead in the long run, just stay strong!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels lonely and upset with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel comfortable.	labels:Hello there, how are you?
text:Kind of angry and disappointed. The seeker has a feeling that she is not very good at this conversation.	labels:I'm very sorry to hear that, did something not go as planned recently?
text:My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends. The seeker feels angry and disappointed. The supporter can respond by helping the seeker to think about the situation better and to calm down.	labels:I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?
text:In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition. The seeker feels angry and disappointed at her friend. The supporter must tell the seeker that she is not the one who did wrong.	labels:It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.
text:Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them. The seeker feels lonely and hurt that her friends would not include her in a group chat. The supporter could tell the seeker that her friends were upset about her recent problems and that they wanted to make sure she felt supported by her friends.	labels:It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.
text:I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this. The seeker feels like she was abandoned by her peers. The supporter could tell the seeker it's totally normal to be hurt by something like this and that she isn't being replaced.	labels:Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat?
text:I talked about it with one friend. He felt bad but what I couldn't understand why he was secretive about the chat too. If he thought we were close why hide stuff? The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter should encourage the seeker to focus on her own friends whom she can trust and talk to about her concerns.	labels:Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already.
text:Do you think it is asking too much on my part? The seeker feels disappointed because of her friends not being as open and honest about her friends as she thought. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is feeling hurt and try to figure out why she feels this way.	labels:On the contrary, I think you might not be allowing yourself to ask enough! Sometimes, the people who are closest to us can actually become even more anxious about how something might affect your feelings. It could be the case with him too.
text:Sometimes I question if it is even worth talking to them about it. People often don't want to say what they really think. Instead they just say whatever to avoid confrontation.. The seeker feels lonely and confused. She's not sure how to approach the situation. The supporter could help her out with finding the right approach.	labels:Some people express themselves best through their actions. Have you tried suggesting a meeting for something you'd usually do to see if they're willing to hang out just as always?	episode_done:True
text:Hello! I am here to listen! How are you feeling? Hello! I am here to listen! How are you feeling? *you.\nI'm very stressed.  Virtual school is so hard. I've never gotten bad grades before this year. The seeker feels stressed, which is the reason for her emotion. The supporter could tell the seeker that her grades weren't the worst in the school and that she should be happy with her accomplishments.	labels:So you are having trouble with Virtual school being so hard and it's causing you stress, am I understanding correctly?
text:Yes, that is correct.  I need to be in a classroom to really grasp the material, I think. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker should focus on the good things and not the bad things.	labels:I remember being in your position. I know it's very hard and I am so sorry that you are stressed.
text:I just want to quit school because I can't seem to do better. The seeker feels stressed with school and wants to quit. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I know you said you want to quit, but hang in there!.
text:I wish I knew how long we would have to be virtual.  I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home. The seeker feels alone and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone.	labels:It sounds like you have always done well with school, this virus has made it to where so many people are struggling. Just chatting with you, I can feel how stressed and anxious about it you are!
text:Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me.   I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The supporter can tell the seeker that she can do it and will make it.	labels:I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?
text:I tried exercise to see if that would help.  It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying. The seeker is feeling lonely, the supporter is supporting the seeker by listening, and it helps the seeker feel heard. This conversation is not about the seeker's emotional status.	labels:When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again. Or take a quick break and get some fresh air? Is there anything else that you do in any other situation that would normally help you relax?
text:I could try deep breathing. Fresh air is hard because we're in the middle of a snow storm! I like to go to a spa when I'm really stressed. The seeker is struggling to understand the material and is very stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker about the material and find out what the seeker thinks about the material.	labels:Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!
text:I will try the deep breathing more often. . The seeker feels lonely, she is stressed and she wants to quit. The supporter can tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Maybe you could reward yourself with a spa trip ever so often, since you enjoy it?.
text:That's a good idea.  Maybe I could make it a reward for a good grade on a test. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!
text:I think it might too! The seeker feels stressed about the fact that she is not in a classroom. She also feels lonely and anxious because of this. The supporter should give the seeker some tips to make her feel relaxed and supported.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Feeling low today. The seeker is feeling lonely and unhappy. The supporter could ask the seeker if there is anything he can help to cheer up?	labels:Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it..
text:I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. The seeker has a strong emotion status. The supporter could ask the seeker if it is possible for her to get together to work on the pandemic.	labels:yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?.
text:Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. The seeker feels isolated and lonely. The supporter should mention the pandemic and how it is affecting all of us. The supporter could also mention that the purpose of a conversation is to support each other, not to criticize. The supporter can suggest a way to support the seeker, like joining a group to meet people and feel part of a community.	labels:Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.
text:Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. The seeker feels a little lonely and worried about her job. Her supporter should ask more details about her work.	labels:Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing..
text:Thanks. It helps to know that I'm not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter can help her get through this.	labels:My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent..
text:So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? The seeker feels lonely, while the supporter helps to understand the situation.	labels:I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so.
text:Ah, something more casual? The seeker feels lonely and worries about her boyfriend breaking up with her. The supporter could help the seeker to feel more loved and supported.	labels:Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
text:That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually! The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker she needs to have a good time and think about other people to avoid feeling lonely.	labels:Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale..
text:Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season! The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter should respond to the seeker's emotion status and ask the seeker if they have any concerns about being remote working. The supporter could also share some conversation recommendations based on the emotion status of the seeker.	labels:That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays..	episode_done:True
text:I need support to feel ok during the pandemic. The seeker feel lonely and need support to help her deal with the pandemic. The supporter may need to give support, like listen to her, and suggest some ways to help her feel better during the pandemic.	labels:Hello.
text:HI there. The seeker is saying something negative and negative. The supporter can give a supportive response to the seeker.	labels:What type of things are you worried about during the pandemic?
text:That I may not find a job soon which is making me depressed. The seeker is worried about losing her income and losing her job.	labels:So just to make sure I understand, you are anxious about possibly loosing your job due to the pandemic.
text:I am not working at the moment, I am looking for a job but it has been really difficult to find one. The seeker feels stressed and worried about losing her job. The supporter can tell the seeker that the pandemic is affecting everyone. The supporter could tell the seeker that the pandemic is affecting all countries.	labels:Have you looked into a hiring agency? They are great at helping find people jobs, especially in these hard times.
text:I have but seems like there are no entry level jobs currently and also some employers have ceased hiring. The seeker is anxious about not finding a job soon which is making her feel depressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to a hiring agency, as they are great at finding jobs for people to fill in the gaps.	labels:After interviews have you been following up to show interest again in the job?
text:Yes I have emailed every employer where I was interviewed. Also I follow up with every hiring agency I have signed up to. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the unemployment rate. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Have you networked with any previous co-workers? They might be able to help you find something as well,
text:They all suggest to wait for a few months till things are bit normal. They also advice to keep trying. The seeker feels anxious about the pandemic. The supporter should help the seeker by giving her some solutions to deal with the anxiety.	labels:Just from chatting with you for a few I can tell this is making you very anxious/
text:Yes it indeed is. The seeker feels anxious about not finding a job, while the supporter wants to encourage the seeker to be patient.	labels:I have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but I found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.
text:It is very difficult to stay home doing nothing, it is very upsetting. I have started to paint which I have always enjoyed doing but again when I see others close me work and settled it makes me feel sad that I don't have a job. The seeker feels anxious about losing her job due to the pandemic. The supporter could ask how she can make sure she gets a job. The supporter could also ask the seeker if she has been following up with the hiring agency. The supporter could ask the seeker how she can get her mind off of it.	labels:I think painting more would be very helpful!
text:I should try doing that, thanks. The seeker feels she is not doing enough. The supporter tells the seeker that she should try to keep busy to keep her mind off of the pandemic, and that she should try to do some hobby that she enjoy.	labels:No problem! If you have any other issues just chat in!
text:No issues other than this at the moment. Have you found a new job? The seeker feels lonely, anxious, and worried. The supporter could tell the person to focus on their hobbies.	labels:I have! I went through hiring agencies and got one. It did take a while, but it was super helpful.
text:Glad to hear, Congratulations!! Hope I find a job soon. The seeker feels anxious that she may not find a job soon. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing everything she can to work on finding a job soon.	labels:I know you will find something soon!
text:Thanks!! The seeker and the supporter had a nice chat. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker is not alone, she has many supporters and she will find a job soon.	labels:You're welcome!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels lonely but the supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:hell, sorry. How are you today?
text:A little down. Kind of broke for Christmas. The seeker feels down and lonely, but the reason causing that emotion is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I totally understand how you feel.
text:Yeah, it's pretty tough because the year went really well until the summer. I was hoping for a strong close. The seeker feels lonely and lonely. The supporter should focus on the things that she could control and help her to make her feel better about that.	labels:If you don't mind may I ask you a few question? Are you trying to find gigs?
text:Yes but with the pandemic, people are just doing small work themselves instead of hiring out. The seeker feels down because she is losing the money in her gig. The supporter could ask the seeker if she is still in touch with the people she was playing with.	labels:Sorry. I guess you have to change your plan so much..
text:That's what I've been doing, but it's a lot of running in place trying to generate any income. The seeker feels lonely, hopeless, and sad. It is impossible for her to have a conversation with a supporter because there is no reason to be lonely, hopeless, and sad.	labels:I meant you had to change your plan.
text:Yes, and the changes I've made to the plan haven't lead to a whole lot more. One of those "painted myself into a corner" situations. The seeker feels lonely and down because of the pandemic. The supporter should try to focus on the other's feelings and emotions.	labels:I am also looking for more gigs and because of Covid, I'm only looking online jobs.
text:Like "work from home" style jobs? The seeker feels that she is a failure. She says, "That's what I've been doing, but it's a lot of running in place trying to generate any income." The supporter should tell the seeker that she did not fail. The supporter can say, "I meant you had to change your plan. I am also looking for more gigs and because of Covid, I'm only looking online jobs	labels:yes just like this mturk.
text:Hmm, maybe I can look into these type of jobs. I don't have a great computer but it could do for some stuff. The seeker has some good ideas to work on her plan. The supporter could ask more questions to the seeker to better understand the situation.	labels:Jobs are super competitive these days. Have you thought about becoming a YouTuber or a live streamer?
text:Yes, I've tried both of those. It's mostly luck based. You just have to hope that enough people get interested to make it work and a lot of wasted effort goes into self-promotion. The seeker is feeling a little down and lonely. The supporter could provide a little bit of encouragement.	labels:I believe after Covid is over more onsite jobs will be available. I hope you will be able to comfortably spend your days until then.
text:I agree with that. I just hope. * I can make it until then. The seeker feels lonely and have lost her confidence. The supporter could encourage the seeker to find a job onsite and get back into work.	labels:Oh I see. I see you have made a lot of effort to get additional income. Wonderful, I believe you are a great worker when you work, whatever you do. You have passion and motivation..
text:That is true, I am a hard worker, no matter the job. The seeker feels stressed with the news from Nashville and wishes her boyfriend will be around. The supporter could encourage the seeker to look forward to spending time with him in a future time.	labels:I would brush up my resume, make it more noticeable, change your LinkedIn profile if you have one. So that future employer will be able to find you, such a great candidate..
text:Hmmm, my resume could use some work, that is true. The seeker is a bit confused by the supporter's comments. The supporter should explain their comments.	labels:About resume, one of my friends added his picture wearing a Trump tie on his resume  lol . I thought it was weird but whatever it makes it noticeable could help. Or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a YouTuber. I heard a lot of people starts their own because of Covid.
text:I never thought about adding a picture to my resume, but it would help show that I'm a professional. I have ran my own business, doing custom woodworking for people. For now, I'd rather work for other people. Plus the whole being broke thing really restricts what I could do for a new business. The seeker has a negative emotion (lonely). We can see a supporter tries to get the seeker to think of some positive things.	labels:Me either, I had never seen a resume with a picture. Yes wear a nice suit and look good..
text:I will try that. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has a lot of people around who will support her.	labels:Oh I see. Woodworking sounds cool! I would do the same and start my own business as a side at first.. It makes me want to lift my dumbells and get some muscles!!
text:Well I think I'm going to go work on my resume and maybe buy some new tools. The seeker feels worried, stressed and lonely.

text:I'm doing alright, I'm facing a lot of academic pressure from my program and I feel trapped. The seeker feels lonely, worried and trapped. The supporter could ask about the academic pressure.	labels:Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now?
text:Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available.. The seeker seems to be stressed and depressed. She is feeling trapped and frustrated with the workload. The supporter should help the seeker to relax and enjoy the holiday season.	labels:I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?
text:I tried, but the coursework is difficult and the other solution is tutorials on youtube but there is so much you can do on your own. Plus I have a job as well, so limited hours. The seeker feels stressed and trapped. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone in feeling stressed from academic pressure. The supporter could also suggest a course of action to solve the problem.	labels:I can relate to this because it is hard to work and do school as well. I can tell it makes you feel concerned about your schooling and you want to do the best you can..
text:I wish so, do your best and hope for the best I guess.. The seeker feels stressed but the supporter would focus on the feeling of being trapped and how to help the seeker feel less trapped.	labels:You are doing great I believe and really trying hard to do your schoolwork right.
text:I just need to deal with the stress so it doesnt effect me. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should ask the seeker if there is any way she can help her out.	labels:Why do you think that might be?.
text:I feel that the stress is effecting my sleep and my work, because I constantly worry. Any tips? The seeker says she needs to deal with her stress. She seems to be facing a lot of challenges. The supporter can tell that the seeker has been to talk to her advisor a lot but still have not been successful in getting the help she needs.	labels:I would try to have a regular to set a goal for each day by stating to yourself today is a new day, remain focus on the task at hand, try not to worry about all tasks at once, and lastly try to find a relaxing sleep schedule that fits your needs.
text:I see, I think making a schedule and breaking task into little ones will help complete them. I guess I will stress less. The seeker feels lonely because she is stressed about her academic career. The supporter should try to comfort the seeker and tell her she will be fine.	labels:Yes, It will be hard at first because you are not use to it, but once you get started your life will be so much more relaxing. Your stress level will become more less than what is was before. Also, You will be able to have a clearer mind to concentrate on your schoolwork more by having this new schedule..
text:These message is really helpful and I will start doing what you have told me as soon as possible. I just want to live happily but thank you for this conversation.. The seeker feels lonely and stressed.

text:Hi there. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she misses her boyfriend a lot.	labels:Hello, Merry Christmas Eve.
text:And to you. You doing alright? The seeker feels lonely. The supporter can let the seeker know that there is someone around her to make her feel more loved. The supporter can also ask the seeker to think about something happy she has instead of being lonely.	labels:How are you today? I am buried in cookie dough, lol, but happy and wwell.
text:That sounds like a cozy scene :) I'm okay, but slightly worried about next year. My job is sort of tenuous and I have about a month to find a new role. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her job. The supporter could tell the seeker she has her own worries and problems.	labels:Yes it is nice. Are you doing anything festive today?
text:No, nothing much. Same as always, on and off work, having a meal with the girlfriend, that sort. (It would help if this system shows us if one of us is typing..) The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter should be aware of the situation and help the seeker.	labels:I understand that times are rough lately. Sounds like there is some time to figure it out, take full advantage of all the time you can. I hope it works out and a new position becomes available, I know your story is shared by many right now. What a crazy time we are in. yes it does, on top it says inputing.
text:Ah fair, that's good to know. Yes, still it doesn't quite help that no matter how many CVs you submit, hit rates for jobs just don't go up. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:what are cv's? I see, I am getting by by dping a billion a day lol. but there is other income, im not sure it would support me otherwise. Are there other lines of work you could look into?
text:I get what you mean about other lines of work. I'm trained as an academic research associate and had to spend a few months last year working in an Amazon warehouse. I feel like I've wasted enough time outside of aimed-for career to go back to doing manual labour. *this year even.. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could say the seeker has a strong support system around her and the supporter can help the seeker even more.

The supporter can tell the seeker to be patient with her mother.	labels:Often police officers are not fully trained in helping mentally ill people, they only access if the person is a danger to themselves or others..

The supporter could also tell the seeker to find things to do to make her feel better.	labels:I understand exactly how you feel since I am also unable to go fly out to see my family this Christmas. It sounds like you are very overwhelmed with the amount of work you have and having no break, correct?
text:it has been such a long year, i am just ready for things to improve. it is hard not having the usual coping mechanisms of socializing with friends or going out. yes, that is part of it. the work wouldn't seem so bad if there was somethign to look forward to but every day feels the same.

The seeker feels depressed, but the reason is not clear. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yeah I understand what you're going through. I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?
text:It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.. The seeker feels lonely, and the supporter can tell the seeker that she is not alone. The supporter can also tell the seeker what she is going through, which is a very important conversation to have with a supporter.	labels:That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another..
text:Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life..
text:Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it.. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Oh absolutely Keri.

Please try not to worry too much as it's a common worry to have. Do you want to tell me the details?.
text:Sure. One of my classes is extremely difficult and the professor has not been responsive at all. The TA is kind enough to make time to help me with homework, but my grades are still not great. It makes me feel really dumb and undeserving to be in that class. The seeker feels as if there is nothing she can do to get an A in the class. The supporter can tell her that the class is a difficult one, but there will come a time when she will get the A that she wants.	labels:So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely?.
text:I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this  class in particular.. I'm afraid of failing, but I'm not sure if that should be a concern either. Over the past 3 years, no one has gotten a grade lower than a B.. The seeker feels a bit of disappointment and worry. The supporter could be more sympathetic to the seeker and help her be more optimistic.	labels:But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard? Do you think that maybe most of your classmates are secretly feeling the same?.
text:Sometimes I think about that. At the same time, I feel like it's unfair to compare myself to others.. The seeker is feeling worried about failing and question her admission into the program. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on her positive thoughts in order to be happy.	labels:This sounds like it might be a self esteem issue and not about your grades. I have felt this sort of thing myself and I do know how awful it is to be so hard on yourself..
text:So what do I do about it? I don't want to keep feeling like this. The seeker is feeling lonely and stressed out. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could talk to people who are in the same situation and see if they can support her.	labels:Have you thought about seeing a therapist? Does your school have any free therapy programmes you could use?.
text:I don't think my school has free therapy programs. I have thought about seeing a therapist but I've heard therapy is very expensive.With student loans, I didn't really put much more research into therapy past hearing about the costs. The seeker feels unhappy, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:A far as I am aware there are charitable organisations which can arrange a few free therapy session for you. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about it?. I have had free therapy sessions before and I found them very helpful.
text:I think free therapy sessions would be a good place to start. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk about her life experiences before she went to school.	labels:It would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are..
text:Yeah, there are definitely a lot of other things i'm insecure about. The seeker feels lonely and worries that she is not good enough for her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker could use a few strategies to overcome this.	labels:Then I think it is probably just a general self esteem issue and nothing academic!. Anyway it's been really nice to talk to you and I hope that everything goes your way.
text:I think talking about this has helped. I'll do a little more digging. Thank you! The seeker feels lonely, worried, and stressed about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:You're most welcome, have a lovely Holiday season..	episode_done:True

text:Hello there. In the past 3 years, I have gotten into 2 car accidents. Neither of them were my fault. I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD.

Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?
text:I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family. I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said "are you not better yet?" and another said "can't you just walk it off?" When I got into my second car accident, people said "again? are you drunk?" Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were.

The supporter could tell the seeker how to make her feel loved.	labels:A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.
text:What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The supporter can tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.
text:Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on. The whole saying of "they don't deserve you at your best when they weren't there when you were at your worst" The seeker feels lonely and sad after her second car accident. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has many supportive friends and she has been through this too.	labels:You are 100% correct. Have you looked into any support groups at all or tried to connect with anyone with similar experiences through social media?.
text:I don't use social media. I quit in 2016, which is also when I started realizing how vain people are. Some of those same friends and family didn't bother to text me even though they had my number. I did find a local group that did social stuff together but they were all really old like 50 years plus. I'm in my 20s so it was hard to relate. The seeker feels lonely and depressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Gotcha!

The supporter should encourage the seeker to try not to worry and help her with anything that can help her feel happy and relaxed.	labels:Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances.
text:yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet. that i failed. The seeker feels lonely and stressed, but she feels pressured to retake the math class. The supporter could tell the seeker that the tutor is not always the best for her. In this case, the supporter would suggest that the seeker talk with her doctor.	labels:I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she can talk to her family in one week.	labels:Well, your therapist is not, in my mind, as important as  your family. But I think that both will understand!.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHi. The seeker feels lonely and upset. The supporter could tell the seeker that she may need to talk to someone else.	labels:How may I help you today?
text:I'm feeling really angry.. The seeker feels angry and tries to suppress it. The supporter should try to get the seeker to talk about it.	labels:Why?
text:My supervisor said she would be in to help cover people on PTO and she never showed.. The seeker is feeling angry at her supervisor, but the reason isn't mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:So your boss never showed up to cover people on PTO is that correct?

The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to work on getting over the disappointment and get back to work.	labels:I don't see why she would get mad but if she does then just leave it alone and move on and just do your job. That is what i would do.
text:Yea, I guess so. The seeker feels lonely and worried, and the supporter should help her to move on.	labels:I honestly do not think she will get mad just try to talk to her. I would just let it go because to me it's not worth being mad over for a long time you have to just let it go.
text:I think I will. I guess i'm worried because I had already expressed my concern with having multiple people on PTO and she specifically said, "it's okay because I can help cover". So she just completely disregarded what I said. The seeker feels lonely but the supporter does not know the reason. The supporter can tell the seeker that the supporter is a person that can help the seeker to feel being loved.	labels:I understand she should of talked to you about changing her mind.
text:So is it even worth bringing it up at all? The seeker feels lonely, upset and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that is not ok to be alone in the world. The supporter could ask the seeker questions to learn more about the problem.	labels:I mean you know it won't hurt to try to bring it up and see what happens. seems to me your boss is not doing her job right.	episode_done:True
text:Not a great day. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter should make a positive comment about the seeker's situation. The supporter should not try to fix the seeker.	labels:How is your day going today? Do you have anything on your mind?.

The supporter could tell her that her girl is not good, and she's not alone. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It really is not is it! I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point..
text:It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was.  Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. The seeker feels lonely, sad and angry. The supporter should try to help the seeker by giving some suggestions, or giving more detail information about the problem.	labels:It could be that you are better off without her? If she has such bad manners then I think that you cn do better..

text:I have seen Rick eyeballing my girl at times.  I think he is an agressive guy when it comes to the ladies. Rick thinks that he is a "playah." The seeker feels lonely, angry and disgusted. As a supporter, he should encourage the seeker to go to therapy.	labels:Do you think that perhaps you should talk to him before anything happens?

The supporter can tell her that she is always there for her.	labels:Well have you thought of any next steps to take?

Maybe we can look at that and possible find better ways to cope?
text:I am feeling depression right now. The seeker is feeling sad, depressed and scared. The supporter could identify the problem of the seeker and suggest some ways to cope.	labels:I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it.. I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want.. One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well.
text:I am really afraid here I don't know what to do. The seeker is feeling very worried and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker he/she has a lot of friends and family, and they will help when they can.	labels:As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals.. It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong.
text:I don't like the noise of ambulance at all any time I see one I don't feel happy. The seeker feels lonely, and she is also worried about the pandemic and her boyfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to take steps to take care of the pandemic, for example, by drinking more water, and to be more social.	labels:I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you.. One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>. Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive. Sometimes this takes time, but it works.  Just because you feel sad doesn't mean you should just do nothing, a person can TALK their way out of sadness and choose to do something different..
text:Thanks your words of encouraging help me a lot. The seeker feels lonely, depressed and anxious. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is having nightmares and ask the seeker if she will talk about her nightmares.	labels:I am glad you were able to talk about how this is affecting you. I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better. If you feel down, talk about it, pray about it but do NOT dwell on it, because that will bring you down. Sometimes we get in a funk, when we do, we can pull ourselves out, I do suggest you write a list of things to do and put on the frige.
text:You are very correct I like you a lot. The seeker is feeling sad, lonely and afraid. The supporter could try to encourage the seeker by asking the seeker how she is feeling. The supporter could suggest the seeker could use one of the coping strategies she shared with her to improve the seeker's mood.	labels:Thank you, how very sweet!  I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D.
text:Lovely I love meeting people like you who has words of wisdom. The seeker feels lonely, and the supporter should encourage the seeker to do things that make her feel better.	labels:I had one more thought about when the ambulance comes by and you get upset. Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go.. I cannot worry about what is not my job. I have a home and family to care for and pets and neighbors.  So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine. When I try to do their job and worry all about them and the sick people, it's not my job and there will be no peace doing the wrong job. If that makes sense..

text:It is not easy right now. That's for sure. . I am wondering if I could do Lyft or Uber. I think a side hustle could work, perhaps?

The seeker feels guilty and ashamed for being selfish and having a relationship problem. The supporter should tell the seeker that she is not a failure, but she is a bit self-centered.	labels:I hear you on that one too!

The seeker feels tired and disgusted about the pandemic, but the supporter has not stated the reason clearly.	labels:Well, it is a pretty significant issue this year :). Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?.

The supporter can make her feel better by giving her good news and solutions.	labels:I don't mean to sound twee but there are things out there in life that can be appreciated for free :).

My friends have a lot of money, though, and none of them are even happy. thats even more saddening. The seeker feels as though there is no bright side. The supporter could tell the seeker that the there are bright sides in life, like the pandemic. People were dying of obesity before the pandemic and that is a big issue.	labels:I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!.
text:Yea, I know, right. I have one friends who has probably about 100k in the bank, and he will complain if he spent 4 cents too much on gas over another gas station. The seeker feels sad and hopeless. The supporter could tell the seeker that the world is not going to be perfect, and we can't expect everything to be perfect.	labels:People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them..

text:Thanks. Probably true. sometimes when i bring it up they'll just argue about it and defend themselves. i just try to move on but it is always there. ok. yea it is 15 minutes so bye bye. good talking. The seeker feels disgusted, but the supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:you too :). you need to finish from your end .. I can't :).	episode_done:True

The seeker has been thinking about the issue, and she has an idea of what is causing her anxiety.	labels:It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming.

text:I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? The seeker is stressed and worries about the amount of work she has to do. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.

text:I was told by a customer at work. I do not know this person well, yet they knew the person he was cheating on me with.. He will not admit it himself..

text:2 years. The seeker is feeling very sad and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that her partner is not cheating on her and she has a lot of friends who can cheer her up.	labels:So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.
text:What do you mean exactly? The seeker feels that she is being discriminated. The supporter should help the seeker not to feel isolated. The supporter should tell the seeker that he is not cheating on her and if he did, he would not lie about it.	labels:Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.
text:I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.. The seeker is feeling really sad. The supporter could ask the seeker how she can help her.	labels:Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.
text:That is true. He is but, has been distant lately.. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter asks for more details.	labels:I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.

Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.

The seeker feels sad, lonely and stressed. There are two issues. The supporter can show the seeker to focus on the positive things in life and the supporter will support the seeker in dealing with the other issue.	labels:You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you?
text:Okay. I will keep that in mind. We are 22.. The seeker is not sure if the supporter is a supporter. The supporter could have told the seeker that she should always be the priority in the relationship and that the supporter would support her no matter what.	labels:Are you intimate with your partner, on a regular basis?
text:Yes but less over the past few months.. The seeker feels lonely, anxious, sad, worried and she feels like she needs reassurance from her partner.	labels:Spicing up the live life can also help to energize hings. I mean, the love life.  Te lack in the last few months could be a physical issue or stress related....for him. Does he mention a lot of stress at the job or is he in college? 22 is young. You are both relatively young. I feel that there is plenty to learn about each other.
text:That's understandable. Maybe I can communicate with him first.. The seeker feels lonely and stressed because she does not know the whole truth about her partner's relationship.

The seeker is not going to communicate with her partner.	labels:Well, you and your man are under a lot of stress, so keep that in mind. The study may be making him withdraw a lot.
text:You are right. I will try to be more sensitive about that. Thank you for your help. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter can tell her the reason is he does not show affection.

text:Yes off campus. Same college.. The seeker s feeling stressed and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone because there are people around her.	labels:Where do you work? Have you seen the customer who said that your partner was cheating? Seen the customer before? Was it a man or woman who dropped the shocking news? I feel that the customer may have a case of mistaken identity indeed.

The supporter could tell the seeker she is in support and she should focus on making friends and enjoying family.	labels:Groups like Habitat for Humanity or UNICEF will help you to build long-lasting friendships. It just takes finding the right volunteer groups and being willing to be pro-active.
text:I guess it makes a lot of sense.  If you go to a party or a bar, you don't know what you will get, as it is a mixed bag of personalities.  Whereas if you go to something like what you suggested then you already know that the people you meet have the same kind of heart. The seeker is more comfortable when she trusts the supporter. The supporter should let the seeker know that there are people in her life she can trust and talk to.	labels:You can do it. I have faith that you can use volunteering as the right method.
text:Thank you for that suggestion, that is really helpful and something that I will take with me from now on. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter can tell the seeker she has close friends. The supporter should ask the seeker about the reason causing that emotion.	labels:Exactly, volunteering is a great option. And there are many organizations to join. Did you need help with anything else?

Good enough to make a life out of it. fear of failing myself because i lose interest in things over time. The seeker feels worried about choosing the wrong career path, so she is unsure about it. The supporter should help the seeker to have a more positive view about herself.	labels:I myself lose interest in many things quite frequently.
text:but what if that thing is your career choice? The seeker feels anxious to choose a subject and feel confident about her choices. The supporter could ask the seeker if she feels confident in her choices.	labels:That is a totally normal aspect of human nature.

text:No. But that is a good idea.. The seeker feels anxious and worried that she will be fired. The supporter could talk to the seeker and give her the reasoning of why her boss wants to let her go.	labels:Maybe your boss can compromise with you. It's worth a shot!

text:I swear, I can't take these lockdowns anymore. The seeker is feeling depressed and lonely.	labels:I can definetely understand why. During this pandemic we have been more isolated than ever. It's not easy.
text:I mean it's one thing to limit capacities in places, but to say we're not allowed to go to our friends' and family's home is just plain ridiculous. . The seeker feels lonely, as she is not allowed to go to the family home and she misses her family. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:It is more than reasonable to be frustrated with regards to that. I myself have not been able to visit my ill mother.

The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker she has people around her to be loved and to help her get through this.	labels:Exactly, the experience feels like it lacks the main connection we share with our loved ones. It is totally normal to want to be face to face instead.
text:I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now.. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker she is not alone, and there are people around her to support her.	labels:I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling. However, it's not the end of the world. Thankfully, researchers have just came up with a vaccine prototype I heard.
text:Yeah, but even with the distribution, some people are saying that things won't return to normal till about late spring/early summer.. It's certainly maddening. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can also talk to the boyfriend if she feels lonely.	labels:I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you.
text:I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter suggests that they should think about the good things they have in their life.	labels:It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly. I know it can be hard, but I am sure you got this.
text:I think over time (sooner than later hopefully) I'll be able to get over it. Thank you very much for talking to me. The seeker feels stressed, worried and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not overreacting and the supporter should understand the seeker's concern and empathize.	labels:It has been a pleasure : )

text:Me and my partner had an argument and I got ghosted after. It's been 2 weeks. The seeker feels upset because she was ghosted. The supporter should try to understand the reason of the ghosts.	labels:That's terrible. So you had an argument and he hasn't spoken to you in two weeks. Is that correct?
text:Yes. The seeker is upset and the supporter needs to know what happened so that the supporter can help the seeker. The supporter needs to be sensitive to the fact that the seeker is upset.	labels:I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings. Hearing you tell me that he has done this is upsetting to me as well. I've had the same thing done to me and I can remember being extremely distraught.
text:Yeah, I just do not know what to do. The seeker is feeling lonely and that her partner has not responded to her in a long time. The supporter could tell the seeker that her partner is being distant and that he has said a lot about his life lately.	labels:Do you mind me asking what the argument was about? If you don't mind going into a little more detail, I may be able to help you more.
text:I was sick and he did not call me all day to even check in on me. I told him that I was upset about that. The seeker told the supporter about what happened. The supporter gave the seeker a few suggestions to help her cope, but also the supporter did not give any suggestions on how to fix the relationship.	labels:That must be such a terrible feeling. So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument? Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past? Are you still there? Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond? I would really like to help you find a solution to this problem, but it appears as though you may not be active anymore. I'm going to wait a few more minute for you to respond before cancelling the chat. In the event that I don't hear back from you, I wish you the best!	episode_done:True

text:Yes. To handle my previous depression I self medicated and ended up going to prison. Made my situation worse. Now trying to adjust but depression is worse having lost job and social stauts. The seeker feels lonely as the supporter provides positive feedback.	labels:Feeling down after an experience like that is certainly understandable, and I suspect that might be the main cause of your depression. Regarding losing your job, I wouldn't worry too much. New businesses are opening each day as the pandemic slowly goes away. You will have plenty of job opportunities. Similarly, you will also regain your confidence and social status as you interact with society more.
text:Yes, but its a vicious circle. Get blue and find it hard to strive. Unfortunately many jobs require background checks these days. Even Amazon! Hope with the vaccine that things will look up. The seeker is depressed and feels anxious. The supporter could ask specific questions to help the seeker feel better about their situation.	labels:I am feeling optimistic about this vaccine, you will see how it helps us all slowly get our lives back to how they were.
text:Yeah. The covid thing is an additional layer of isolation and depression. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask for more details about the reason that is making the seeker feel this way.	labels:It will soon be over hopefully. Hey, just try to focus on improving yourself as a person. Try to find an activity you enjoy doing. Keep exercising, that's great for your body and mind. And definetely talk to any closed one you have if you need to.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone and that there are people around to support her.	labels:It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy.

text:How are you feeling today?\nHi, not so good to be honest. I've been feeling very depressed recently. I've been doing very bad in this class and that is just not like me. The seeker feels depressed but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Oh, so you are usually a pretty decent student? I'm sorry to here that you are experiencing this.
text:I was up until this pandemic started. I feel like this shift to online learning has really taken it's toll on me and my learning.

The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to cheer her up.	labels:Most people where masks of content, so you never know how much they are struggling. It's not always beneficial to compare yourself to others. Are you having issues with focusing?
text:I think so? I think it is just the way the material is taught now. We have these "Zoom" sessions where everything is taught online, but it just all feels so impersonal. We are expected to read things on our own and then come to class ready to do these activities. I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own. I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time. I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship. The seeker feels like her classmates are doing fine and thinks she is the only one struggling. The supporter should let the seeker know that it is not the case. The supporter should also let the seeker know that she is not alone in this struggle.	labels:What happened when you reached out to the teacher?
text:He just gave me some additional books to read, but I did not find that helpful. I really do well when I have someone teach the material to me, not just tell me to read on my own. But maybe I'm not able to do well because I'm stupid. I know I should be able to understand things on my own, but I just can't seem to do that. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could be clear about the problem the seeker is facing and ask the seeker to make sure she is getting enough sleep, eating well and exercising.	labels:I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist. Does your class have a study group? Usually schools offer free tutoring, because students volunteer to do it for credits toward a teaching degree. have you heard of that? There is always a way. You have to be smart to get a scholarship. You deserve to be in that class as much as anyone else.
text:I have tried the group study sessions, but I feel like I don't retain as much. I just get very discouraged when I see how smart everyone else in my class is. I don't know if my school offers free tutoring now. They used to, but I am not sure if they are still offering it due to the pandemic. I'll try that though. It might help to get one on one attention from a past student who did well. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could acknowledge the seeker's feelings, but also offer a solution to the situation.	labels:Well, they most likely do it over zoom. But it's better because it's one on one.

The supporter also tells the seeker she is not alone, and that she has many people around her to help.	labels:Sometimes I get seasonal depression during winter, I'd say it's relatively common. If they value your work, then you must be objectively doing okay. Maybe you shouldn't be so hard on yourself.
text:Yep, SAD is not fun. For me it's year-round though. Maybe. I push myself a lot to the point where it is detrimental at times. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter should keep a positive tone. The supporter has a suggestion to help the seeker.	labels:Have you tried exercise? Research shows it can help with depression.

The seeker feels lonely and depressed but the supporter gives positive advice. The supporter gives the seeker a positive conversation.	labels:I used to garden and was surprised how specific the nutrient needs and care are for each type of plant needs in its specific way.
