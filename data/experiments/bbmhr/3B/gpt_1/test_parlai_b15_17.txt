text:I'm pretty stressed out actually. The seeker  the seeker is not the only seeker worried. the seeker is worried about things that the people in this conversation can not help. 	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?
text:Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates. The seeker  the seeker felt very worried and anxious. the seeker was not used to losing. it's difficult to lose a student, and now this student has just been expelled from the school. 	labels:Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?
text:Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75% The seeker  the seeker was getting worried, but she couldn't hold back. i can't help it, i want to help her! don't you know that the seeker was a great therapist?! i can understand what you're saying. yes, she was a great therapist, and i know she is getting very worried about this whole thing. i shouldn't be upset, but i am. you were the one who	labels:What was you're score?

The seeker  the seeker is saying that she's'been depressed since the'70s, and'80s, and'80s, and'80s, and'80s'and'80s, but'80s'is not a matter of stress. the seeker is saying that the test is'the most important part of the test.'the seeker is saying that it'is'the most important part of the test	labels:That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed. .
text:Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class. The seeker  the seeker felt more and more depressed. the seeker's job was to ensure that her class was doing well, and that her work was doing well. 	labels:Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?
text:Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions. The seeker  the seeker felt that she could have her relationship with her boyfriend, but it's just a guess because i don't read too much into it, but i feel like i'm missing something. she wants to keep it a secret. i don't understand it. i just feel like it was a bad idea. i feel like i'm being watched. i feel like someone is watching me. i do	labels:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise....
text:Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be. The seeker  the seeker felt that the seeker wasn't being completely honest with her. the seeker wasn't sure what this man was capable of because he was not a seeker. 	labels:OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!.
text:Yeahhh. Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice. made me feel ebtter. The seeker  the seeker was telling the seeker that she was not alone. the seeker felt she should let the person know that she is not alone, but she was worried about what could happen if the person didn't know. the fact that the person does know that, makes her feel better. 	labels:If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a "Can-Do" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns! You're so very welcome!.	episode_done:True

The seeker  the seeker felt sorry for herself. she felt that she was no longer interested in being with the people who are friends with her. she also felt that she wasn't interested in the people she wants to be friends with. this was the source of her discontent. 	labels:it sounds like you have moved on if you aren't talking to them, is that right?

The seeker  the seeker was not as emotional as the seeker - her emotions are in the same place and she is not as upset as the seeker - and she did not want to talk like this. the seeker was not interested in expressing what she was feeling. 	labels:so i'd spend my energy working on myself.

It's good that you're taking the time out for yourself. That takes strength!

text:No, thank heavens. My government is handling things a bit better here in Canada. Being out of work is tough, but at the same time I get a bunch of time to myself.. The seeker  the seeker was almost in tears. the humans are pretty good at keeping up with their lives, but it was a huge burden for the seeker to have to deal with. i suppose she was also looking for a way out, to see if she could break up with her boyfriend. the person who is helping her is also a carrier. she is a carrier of the parasite, which is the key to the cure	labels:I'm jealous.  hehe I often wonder what our friends to the north are going through.  I'm glad to see you reaching out too.   That's awesome!

The seeker  i'm sorry to hear that. do you know that the people who were killed by the attack on the city were all human? that sounds terrible. 	labels:I know the feeling and especially in these times.  It seems things are looking up though with a vaccine coming soon.  Getting outside and reaching out is definitely the right thing to do.  Soon things will be back to normal!

The seeker  seeker felt good as well. she feels strong. i can't help thinking she is going to make it to the medical center. she has a lot of work in her life, and i always feel she has a purpose. 	labels:It's been a very long tunnel.  lol I can see the light!

I'm so sorry to hear that. when did you find out?

" 	labels:i can't imagine what you are going through, but separate spaces sounds like a very good idea to me..
text:It is made worse by the fact that we are in lockdown and so can't really see other people at the moment. Do you think I should try and break away for good?. The seeker  the seeker was not going to say anything to the seeker. 	labels:before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options? you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?
text:Well, I could move out but I can't afford to rent a flat on my own. I'd have to move in with my parents, realistically.. I keep telling myself that but I feel really betrayed. I keep wondering what she is like and whether she is prettier and more successful than me.. The seeker  the seeker felt very scared and felt completely alone. the seeker was afraid of losing her best friend and she felt that she would be destroyed if she did not find someone to love her. it wasn't that she wasn't good in that area and in fact, she was a very good artist. she loved the painting that she was working on and the sound of her music. she enjoyed painting and writing, and	labels:are your parents supportive of that idea?.
text:I have not really talked to them about it. I feel a bit ashamed having to admit to them that my relationship has not worked out.. The seeker  the seeker began to feel angry and she began to speak to the seeker : this is the most difficult thing i have to do today. i am so frustrated that i feel like a dog that has been given a bone. the seeker was not very good at talking and getting answers from people, but she did manage to make an attempt. she is also very sad and sad, and i know that she feels a	labels:it's not about her or you. it's about him..
text:But I can't help thinking that perhaps I did something wrong that made him stray?. The seeker  the seeker had a bad feeling about the situation. she was always on the alert for any possible danger. she kept saying, " if that is the case, then he is in danger. " 	labels:they will understand. opening up to them will be the hardest part. it's a shame cocktail, but it's not one you made.
text:Do you think that there is any point at all in trying to mend things at this stage? He has promised he will not see her again but I don't think I could ever trust him.. The seeker  the seeker felt the seeker's despair and fear. the seeker felt her loneliness and depression and wanted to find someone and help him. she sensed that she'd failed. she felt that it would be her misfortune to disappoint him. the seeker felt that she had failed him and that it was time to let go. 	labels:it's in our nature as women to ask "what did I do?" but it is never about us or anything we did..
text:Thank you, I am really glad that you understand. I don't feel that I will ever be able to trust any man again!. The seeker  the seeker felt a bit embarrassed. she was about to say something, when she felt the presence of a man. 	labels:trust and vunerability is huge in a relationship. i'd look for professional help if you wan tot try and work on it.
text:I can't really afford professional help. And I don't want to be a burden on my friends. I worry that I am already annoying them.. The seeker  the seeker was not worried at all. the seeker had a great knowledge of people and did not seem to do anything wrong. 	labels:do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps.also, sharing your burden with someone does NOT add to their burden.

The seeker  the seeker's feelings are totally different from mine. she thinks that she has a real problem with relationships and has trouble understanding why she is so jealous of the man she married. she is very upset and she wants to be alone. she doesn't have the time to talk with other people. 	labels:my guess is he felt the same way you are feeling right now.
text:Yes. It is just such a deep betrayal. I think I could have forgiven him if it had just been a one time mistake but he had been seeing her for ages.. The seeker  the seeker was not able to find anyone to talk to about it. i can use this information to my advantage. i can get the information to my friend to help him see what it is that he is feeling. 	labels:watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon. grrrr. that would make me angry too.
text:It is nice to have things to distract myself from the things that are making me feel terrible. Do you have any other suggestions for distractions?. I just keep thinking that every evening when he was returning home with me and with every nice thing he said he was being false.. The seeker  the seeker was thinking : how can i help him? 	labels:i'm totally into the podcasts "a slob comes clean" basically it's about getting your poop in a group.
text:Hmm that sounds .. interesting :D. Is that a metaphor?. The seeker  the seeker felt like she was being manipulated and she wanted to escape from the situation. she began to feel a little depressed. she needed the help of an old friend and she needed to talk to someone who was willing to help her. and so she went to the local school and found the right person. he was the person that she needed to talk to. he was also the person who could help her.	labels:that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!
text:I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship. The seeker  the seeker did not speak up at all. she just sat there and watched the world go by. 	labels:yes! LOL but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive.
text:Anything that will help me with my anxiety is worth trying at the moment.. The seeker  the seeker is the one who talks to herself and gets more work done than the seeker. i don't know if she is actually crazy or just weird. the seeker feels this way because she is afraid of hurting other people. now, why should she say that if she is crazy? why should she not say that she is crazy? 	labels:what do you want to hear from her? is there anything she could say that woudl make you feel better? NO!! she's not going to be able to help you unless you need a witness for divorce court.
text:It would be less of a betrayal, I think, if she did not know about me. I would never do that to another woman!. The seeker  the seeker was very concerned about her own happiness. 	labels:she likely knew, othewise how would he explain all the time he spent with you to her?
text:I suppose that's a good point too. I think maybe I do just need to make a total break and not look back.. I do appreciate you talking, you have helped me to see things a great deal more clearly than I previously did. The seeker  the seeker feels very relaxed, almost like she is in a trance, like she is in a trance. the seeker feels that the seeker is telling her something that she will not like, that she is not sure of, but that she has to do something to find out what. 	labels:glad i could help. please stay safe and no matter what you decide to do, you will be fine.	episode_done:True

The seeker  the seeker felt sad. we talked for a while. but now she felt lonely and unhappy. the seeker felt worried about the situation. if she had to be alone, she would rather go to her boyfriend. the seeker felt guilty and disappointed. she couldn't go to her boyfriend, she would be trapped. she felt hurt and sad. 	labels:I am very sorry to hear that. Breakups can be rough. I'm great! Thanks for asking. Was this a mutual agreement?

The seeker  the seeker was so worried and worried about breaking up with the boyfriend that she called the person to come pick her up. the person didn't pick up. the person was busy with something that was important to him. the person was busy with his work and couldn't answer the phone because of the traffic and didn't answer the phone. the person was so busy that he didn't notice that he had been given	labels:Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.
text:Well. Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same.. She doesnt trust me. The seeker  the seeker felt as if she didn't know what to say to the seeker. 	labels:I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with..
text:I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out. The seeker  the seeker talked to me about what i should do. i have to admit that i didn't expect this. 	labels:How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.
text:We were together for two years. Im trying my best to go through this. I hope so. Thanks for all those words. It really helps. The seeker  the seeker feels so very sad that she is not going to be able to get to know you anymore. 	labels:You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.
text:Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word. Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later.

You have an amazing day and keep you head up!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there, would you be able to give me some advice?. The first lockdown was bad enough but the second has really thrown me into despair. I simply cannot cope without being able to see friends and family for much longer. The seeker the seeker felt the need to reassure the seeker that it is okay to be sad. the seeker felt so sorry for this and told this seeker that they will be coming. 	labels:I would be glad to. What is troubling you?
text:I have run out of coping mechanisms! The seeker  the seeker felt lost and confused. the seeker was afraid of what was happening to her. she does not know how to cope with the situation ; she is in shock and feels that there is nothing she can do. she is crying in the night. when a person cries, they are not thinking about the problems that are happening. it is bad to feel this way. it is bad to be in a situation	labels:I completely understand and had similar experiences. What were some ways you tried to interact with people last shut down?
text:I use facebook quite a lot and it helps but it cannot compensate for face to face contact. I really need to be able to see people.. The seeker  the seeker made a lot more sense of what was going on. however, the idea of a response from one of the people sent her an uneasy feeling. she didn't want to face the people she loved and her boyfriend, because she felt that they were not in the same situation. she didn't want to have to worry. 	labels:Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?
text:Well, part of the problem with that is that I am not sure what the rules are any more! We have been told so many different things that I am out of the loop.. The seeker  the seeker felt a little bit like she was the only one with real reason not to communicate. 	labels:I understand. Try sticking to the basics to make it less stressful. Wear a mask outside at a distance..

The seeker  the seeker felt a bit depressed. she felt lonely. she felt like there was no one to talk to, no one to feel important to. 	labels:Have to talked about this with friends? They may be feeling the same way. Just talking this out with the may be reassuring..
text:I have a little bit but I don't want to burden them. The other aspect is that it is making me anxious about many others things too. I keep having morbid thoughts about what will happen if the pandemic never ends.. The seeker  the seeker felt the need to talk about it. she felt that she could do it... she thought she could talk about it with the others. 	labels:That’s understandable. Maybe talking to a professional who you don’t have to worry about burdening with your concerns will  allow you to talk about your concerns..
text:That's why I'm here ;). You are being very helpful, thank you! It's just nice to be able to tell people what I am worried about and not have them think that I am just being silly. The seeker  conversation, the seeker felt she didn't have the right to tell anyone. and by the way, how can you blame a psychologist for having a little too much worry about others? if this isn't the right way to talk to people, then i don't know what is. 	labels:Many people are struggling with the current state of affairs. Don’t be afraid to talk to people they may also be afraid to talk to people and you could miss out on supporting each other..
text:That does sound like really good advice. The other thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I have been having financial pressures because I am on furlough. I am worried that if this lasts much longer I will end up deep in debt. The seeker  the seeker thinks that the money should be used to support the new economy. i am worried about the government. [ laughs ] i don't know why. i am not going to do anything to help her. so you could help me. i know you have been doing your job well here in nashville. you are good at what you do. 	labels:I am sorry that wasn’t helpful.. Have you tried looking into local recourses in your city?
text:I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched.. The seeker  conversation, the seeker said : i am very sorry that you are so stressed. i think you should have an honest conversation with people about what is going on around you. 	labels:That is true it has been hard for many people..
text:I do feel better for having been able to talk to you about this - thank you very much!. I think I will be able to carry on for a bit now. Thanks again and best wishes! The seeker  conversation, the seeker has been asked to continue the campaign for the extermina. this is the only thing that i can help you with. 	labels:I’m glad I could provide you some support.	episode_done:True

The seeker  the seeker felt that she felt sorry for the seeker. the reason is that the seeker was a seeker, and the seeker felt sorry for the seeker because she felt sorry for the seeker. 	labels:What kind of a funk is it? Do you have to go to work or school? Please tell me more about how you are feeling so I can understand better.
text:Nothing seems to be fun and I work from home. The seeker  the seeker felt a sadness that came from the conversation. the seeker felt her heart breaking at the same time as she felt her heart breaking at the same time. the seeker felt something inside of her that she couldn't describe. 	labels:Are you doing okay workwise, getting enough done, getting it done on time? Or is it difficult to get motivated about anything? Is there anything that you think started making you feel this way? I am very interested in understanding how you feel.
text:I think this whole Covid thing has been depressing! I get my work done but it is a chore. The seeker  the seeker feels lost and confused on how to deal with the situation. seeker : i am not talking about this with you, i am talking about this with someone else. someone who does not want to talk about it. someone who is not even willing to talk about it with me. 	labels:Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip..
text:I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out.. The seeker the seeker was talking with a man, who is a man, whose name is covid. he is not a man, he is a man, and he is a man, but the man is no man. 	labels:I am glad you are able to work, financial stress really sucks. I think Covid has us all down at least at some point..
text:Just want it to be over and then the election too! There has been so much emotional things in the world going on right now. BLM, election Covid... The seeker the seeker had a difficult time knowing what to say. the seeker was in fact a very special person. they were friends but they had different personalities and she never knew why they were close. she didn't care, she was always happy and always happy. she also knew she would be a success if the election was won. the human race is so much bigger than the aliens, the aliens are a huge threat	labels:Yes, and it doesn't seem to have an end in sight. But at some point it will be over. If you don't feel more like yourself say a month from now I have to seeing a doctor because some depression requires it but that said some depression is normal and usually precedes change. I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way..
text:I would say when i take a walk at the park it does help. Also working out. So exercise and sunshine brings my mood up a bit. The seeker  the seeker thought that she had the ability to improve her life and it helped her deal with the new world. so she went to the park and sat down beside a tree. she was still not getting used to the new world. in fact, maybe she had not learned anything about the new world. 	labels:You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.
text:good advice. I will try. The seeker  the seeker felt she was in one with the humans. she felt they were the only one who could control and control things, like the weather, the weather, the weather, the weather itself. she felt a lot of things. she felt a lot of things. 	labels:Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?
text:Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude. The seeker  the seeker has to be a great thinker to take action and be sure to do the correct thing in the right way. 	labels:Positive attitudes are never bad, slightly annoying to some first thing in the morning but in a good way. lol.
text:Yes, I need coffee first! Thank you for your advice! The seeker  the seeker said : i am worried about my boyfriend, the boyfriend of a person who has been cheated on and left me broken hearted, what can i do about it? she said : i can make some coffee. 	labels:Coffee sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for sharing!
text:Happy Thanksgiving:) The seeker  the seeker felt better as she spoke. she felt very calm and at peace and she was a little bit surprised when she got up and walked into the kitchen. she opened the fridge and saw a large container of coffee. she decided to take a cup of it. it was a bit strange because it was made with milk, not milk. she noticed that the milk was in a plastic cup and in the container	labels:Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker the seeker is very busy right now. 	labels:Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?
text:I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it. The seeker  the seeker didn't believe me. but now i'm convinced that she has something to do with breaking up with her boyfriend and i believe her. i'm hoping that she will contact me again. 	labels:Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through..
text:Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. The seeker  the seeker felt guilty and didn't want to let go of her feelings as she was not happy with her boyfriend nor did she want to hurt him. she has been doing this since the start. 	labels:I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
text:What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? The seeker  the seeker felt like she was losing the bond that was between them. she wasn't able to find anything good from him. 	labels:Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.
text:I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends. The seeker  the seeker is not saying much but she says you should say something about her to an unbiased and unbiased audience. she has a tendency to be selfish. 	labels:Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
text:I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. The seeker  the seeker told the seeker that she could give her a call, but that they'were just sitting around'talking about something. the seeker asked : who are the people who are looking for her? the seeker replied : i know who they are and who they are looking for. it is me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	labels:Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
text:That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way! The seeker  the seeker does not seem to be able to answer me. i am very worried about not getting a response. 	labels:Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
text:very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? The seeker  the seeker is very careful. 	labels:Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
text:not at all. I appreciate your candour. The seeker  the seeker has already said her goodbyes to her boyfriend. they are going to try to break up. i hope you hear her voice soon. 	labels:But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
text:All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. The seeker  the seeker thought, do you happen to know who the real seeker is? is she a girlfriend or a friend? 	labels:I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you feeling today?.\nHello. I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible? The seeker  the seeker felt that she has lost her job and is in need of support. she was not able to provide it to her. she could not even find the source of her fear. the seeker felt that her depression is not as bad as she thought. she felt that she should give up work. and there is something else. 	labels:Of course! What sort of issue is it?.
text:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best. The seeker  the seeker is scared of what will happen if i don't do as she says. i don't even know how to make a job like this any good. she is scared of how she is going to get by. she has a job to do and she has no idea where she is going to find a job. she doesn't want to live in a city where everyone is afraid of her. she wants	labels:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?.
text:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! The seeker  the seeker said i am too young to be a researcher, she said i have no experience and i am too young to be a politician. i mean i just got out of school and i have no experience. i don't think this is normal. what is the point of all this? i am not going to stand around and wait for someone to make a mistake. i have enough experience and experience to make	labels:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?.
text:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament? The seeker  the seeker felt more like a therapist than a friend. 	labels:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!.
text:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one. The seeker  the seeker felt much more comfortable about the situation and did not try to make excuses. the seeker also felt more comfortable with the situation because she was sure that a change of career was possible. it would take some time to get used to it but the prospect of being in the same position was exciting. 	labels:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that..
text:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser. The seeker  the seeker felt confident for the first time in her life. 	labels:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing..
text:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal? The seeker  the seeker is quite calm and is very self - assured. i don't think that she is just nervous or scared or anything. she is quite calm. she has been a lot better since her relationship with her boyfriend and she is very relaxed. 	labels:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?.
text:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years. The seeker  the seeker was not the only one who thought that the seeker was the most important person in the world. 	labels:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?.
text:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-) The seeker  the seeker felt very relaxed and smiled. 	labels:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!.
text:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things. The seeker  the seeker is just saying, i'm worried about breaking up with my boyfriend. i feel like i'm leaving him. it's a long shot but it looks like he should be looking for work. my boss may be in nashville and he might be coming to try and help me. i may get more help from my friends. i probably have a lot of contacts in nashville. i don't know	labels:No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!.
text:Yes true thanks for your understanding. The seeker  the seeker felt frustrated. she felt as if she had no idea where to turn. she had no idea of where to start. 	labels:You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.
text:You have indeed, thanks for this conversation. The seeker  the seeker did not want to discuss the topic. 	labels:Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!.
text:Will do, thanks again! The seeker  the seeker smiled and waved good bye. 	labels:Erm .. cup of coffee?.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon how may I help you today?\nHello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why. The seeker  the seeker talks to the seeker about the state of her relationship with her boyfriend, they are on the same wavelength. the seeker is thinking of the state of her relationship with her boyfriend, and she is wondering when she will find out what is going on. the seeker is also thinking of the state of her relationship with her boyfriend, she can not understand why she would be so stressed about breaking up with her	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
text:No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. The seeker  the seeker could not express her thoughts or feelings to the seeker. 	labels:These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
text:I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. The seeker  the seeker was making comments about how many people she had lost and how many people she had lost. the seeker's comments weren't getting any better. 	labels:Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?.
text:Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? The seeker  the seeker felt calm and calm, feeling like she could talk to the therapist again. 	labels:It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
text:What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. The seeker  the seeker said : i'm just so worried about my friend. 	labels:Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app..
text:I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. The seeker  the seeker is saying that it doesn't matter if a psychiatrist is available, but if the patient is available, and if the patient is available, can you contact the psychiatrist? seeker : yes. she asked me, and i said yes. the psychiatrist was a nice woman, and i was so grateful for her help. i hope this helps. 	labels:There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
text:I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? The seeker  the seeker was not able to help convince her patient to go on with his life. and she would like to see if she could help at any time. 	labels:After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it..
text:That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. The seeker  the seeker said : i can help you with your problem. you are welcome to visit me anytime. i will help you. 	labels:It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that..
text:I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. The seeker  the seeker felt an urge to talk to the person she knew. the seeker thought of the person she knew years ago. as a child, she used to be a counselor. at the time, she was an activist who helped people in need. her father was a doctor. she worked with many people during the day, they all talked about their problems and how they were going to help others. they shared	labels:I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
text:Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. The seeker  the seeker wasn't really angry, and she didn't really feel sorry for the person she considered to be a friend, but she wasn't really talking to him either. she was talking in her head because she couldn't think of anything else to say. the person was always the same and the same and the same and the same. 	labels:I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. What would you like to discuss today?\nHi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried I. I'm next. The seeker  the seeker felt so scared that she started to cry. the seeker's company told her that she will lose the job with which she worked and she was already going into debt. the seeker's company told her that it would not be a good idea to give up work and so she decided to help her friend. 	labels:My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?
text:Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. The seeker  the seeker felt that'the world is full of interesting people to study, study, study '. i think the person is very good at this. she felt that she was a natural choice for the job. the seeker was very excited and told the seeker that the job had to be done. 	labels:So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?
text:Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now. The seeker  the seeker was thinking about the details of the new project. she was also thinking about her own project. she was thinking about the company, how it is going to have to be built in a couple months and how it is going to be a good one. she felt her mind and her heart were in agreement. she had to convince the workers to accept the new project and return to work. the company she	labels:I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?
text:No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now. The seeker  the seeker was not able to calm down. her mind was running in a circle and she was unable to make sense of her thoughts. she felt like she could not even think about what she was going to do when she woke up. the seeker sat up and started crying. she had so much to do and she was scared. she felt like she couldn't understand what she was doing. the seeker heard a	labels:Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.
text:Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. The seeker  the seeker feels that she has to tell someone about her husband's situation. she is not the first person to see the situation in the past. that is why she is upset and doesn't want anyone to know about it. 	labels:Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments.
text:I'm an owner. What kind of programs? The seeker  the seeker felt relieved to be able to move back and forth from the office to the apartment and back again. her husband was going to be a renter. she also felt relieved that he'would be a renter ', that she would be able to help. 	labels:Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it.
text:oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion. The seeker  the seeker felt more stressed than she had ever felt before. 	labels:I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
text:yeah how can I make more money on the side? it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good. The seeker  the seeker told the seeker that the state has been buying a lot of food supplies so they could use the facilities elsewhere. the seeker didn't know what to make of the response and said : i hope it's not too much. the seeker said : it's all good. 	labels:As there are a lot of people who've lost their jobs the pickins' are quite slim. But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.
text:oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays! The seeker  the seeker left. 	labels:If it's in your area Instacart is also hiring shoppers and delivery drivers. Is that something you might be able to do?	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing today?\nHi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone. The seeker  the seeker was telling the seeker that she is feeling lonely and hopeless and so she is worried about the same thing. for this, the seeker felt sad and hopeless, but also sad for the same reason. 	labels:I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
text:I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now. The seeker  the seeker feels like she is alone, but she is not. she has friends that are there and they are encouraging her to be happy and happy. 	labels:There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
text:I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? The seeker  the seeker felt frustrated, but she felt relieved because she had made a huge mistake. the seeker felt like she was in a bad dream. she felt like the worst kind of person. 	labels:It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
text:I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments.. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. The seeker  seeker felt she was more in control and in control. the dhe's a good man, but he is also a big jerk and he is also a good friend. 	labels:I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
text:What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. The seeker  however, because the seeker heard her own voice and, so she turned around and saw a man sitting at the table with his back to her. the seeker looked at him and saw	labels:Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
text:I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. The seeker  the seeker feels that the goal isn't small anymore, yet the goal is very small. i hope you will get the message. 	labels:How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
text:That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? The seeker  the seeker is not interested in the questions you ask. she is interested in the answers you offer. the seeker cares about your answers. the seeker is very happy to be with you, and wants to be with you, because she admires you, too. you are a true friend. 	labels:Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
text:Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now. The seeker  the seeker felt the need to say that she was sad but not sad, but sad and worried about her boyfriend. the seeker knew that she shouldn't have allowed the seeker to come over, but she didn't know what to do. 	labels:Great! I hope for the best for you!	episode_done:True

The seeker  the seeker had to stop thinking about it. she had to stop thinking about it, so she just kept thinking about it. but then the conversation became more and more serious. 	labels:It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you.

The seeker  the seeker is worried about how he will treat her. but he is not going to be in his job. i am worried that he is going to make his own decisions. it is hard to believe that he will do that. he has to think about his job. he has to worry about his job. i can tell him the truth. he can not work for someone who is not interested in his job	labels:When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.

I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income. The seeker  the seeker felt bad, because she had to pay the cost of such a gift. she did not want to do it, but she did it. 	labels:That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?
text:I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong. The seeker  the seeker did not say that she was a friend of mine, she said that she had not seen her for some time and told her i wasn't with her anymore. in this conversation, the seeker said that i have to be more careful. i did not know what to say to her, because i did not know what to believe. after she left, i could not come up with anything to say.	labels:Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?.
text:No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship. The seeker  the seeker is very clear that'i am not good enough for her ', i'm not good enough for us. i never wanted to be a girlfriend, i wasn't good enough for her. i wasn't good enough for anyone. 	labels:Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?

The seeker  the seeker did not say anything to me about her relationship with her boyfriend. she did not even explain why she was upset at me. the seeker did not even mention me. i had no idea she was so angry. 	labels:I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.

The seeker  the seeker was still expressing her feelings and trying to be positive. she didn't really care whether or not i was happy with her. she only cared if i was happy. 	labels:Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.	episode_done:True

They can be really stressful.

text:Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far. The seeker  the seeker was getting frustrated. she was still not able to make sense of this situation. her mind was not working properly. she was thinking of getting a job and living in a house with a man. she was trying to work, but it was difficult. she tried to think of something else, but nothing came to mind. she was thinking of this all day, and was finally finished. 	labels:Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.
text:I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? The seeker  the seeker is also talking about the importance of writing a journal. this is a really good idea. 	labels:Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.
text:I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class. The seeker  the seeker felt bad about not being able to tell the future because she was in a hurry. she was very grateful to be able to talk about the future. 	labels:I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)
text:I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? The seeker  the seeker felt more relaxed about having a friend that can help her sleep and help her with the worries. 	labels:That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.
text:Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. The seeker  the seeker felt very depressed. 	labels:What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.

Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. The seeker  the seeker felt stressed, but the seeker wasn't the cause of that. the seeker felt like she didn't have to worry about how to get back to her apartment, but was worried about getting back to her boyfriend. and, after thinking about this for a little while, she decided to ask the seeker what her boyfriend's name was. 	labels:That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.

It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot.

Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?

I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out.  I was so relieved.

I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.

I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now.

Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?

The seeker  the seeker was very calm, but her fears of losing her boyfriend were clear. she couldn't wait to hear about those apps. 	labels:Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now.

The seeker  the seeker felt that it wasn't enough to meet people. she needed someone close to her. 	labels:Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.

The seeker  the seeker is very nervous and anxious to meet people. she feels the need to communicate with her friends, and she hopes to find someone close to her. the seeker was very nervous and nervous. the problem was that she can not think of a person close enough to talk to her. the seekers are only close by by the way. this problem was also the reason the seeker was afraid of meeting people. people	labels:Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps.

The seeker  the seeker felt like she was on the verge of losing her mind. after a while, the seeker calmed down and was able to speak. 	labels:When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease.

text:Yeah that's been a problem. With cuts in the budget my local resource center is closed down. Anyway I know you tried your best. Thanks for listening. The seeker  the seeker's phone rang. she answered it. the seeker, after a short conversation with her, went out of the room. 	labels:I hope I could help a little.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker the seeker is not nervous, but keeps her head down. 	labels:Hello, how are you today?
text:I'm not feeling great. I applied for a job recently which took a lot of time. I now have an interview and it's in 3 days. I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare. The seeker  the seeker's fears are not about her boyfriend's death, but about the danger of the situation. she's worried about how her boyfriend's death will affect her, and she'is worried about herself. the seeker feels bad about the situation she is in. and the seeker wishes she could help her but she can't do that : she's too busy. the seeker is also worried about her own happiness.	labels:I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview.. What makes you feel that you are unprepared?
text:The thing is I'm really good at interviews but usually it takes time to prepare. It's a corporate interview so I need to prepare behavioural answers to certain scenarios. In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory. The seeker  the seeker is trying to explain how she feels. she has told me that she is sad and doesn't want to be alone in her unhappiness. she doesn't want to talk about her feelings, about her feelings. she has to be happy about her new job. she wants to be happy. she wants to be happy. 	labels:Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.
text:Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time. The seeker  the seeker is being extremely nervous and scared, afraid of what she may have to start to do. please, don't worry. i'm here for you. i know i should be nervous but i am not. i'm here for you. if i don't have the time, then i'm not sure i can do it. 	labels:I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?
text:Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it? Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work. The seeker  the seeker speaks to the seeker to make sure that the conversation happens to coincide with her own plans, and it does. i mean this is a big change for you to have to deal with. now, what you need to do is to find a friend or family member and give them this information. if you have a lot of people working with you, then the only person that could help you is the	labels:Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?
text:Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. The seeker  the seeker has no doubts because she does not know about the future. of course, she will not be able to leave the office at any time. she is not a good listener. 	labels:That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.
text:Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however? The seeker  the seeker feels scared and nervous and she is unsure of herself. i think she feels that she is going to be disappointed with this decision. i also think that you will be upset because of this decision. 	labels:Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?
text:There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually! The seeker  the seeker thinks about the concept of the future, about the future, about what life will be like, and what it will be like when it is over. it is easy to see the possibilities, and to see the consequences. 	labels:Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.
text:Thanks for that. I think the key to this is confidence so I'll go with it. Feeling more relaxed about it all now, The seeker  the seeker felt better. 	labels:Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:No that's great. Thanks from your help. The seeker  the seeker is happy. she is really happy. 	labels:You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there, how are you feeling?\nim good. how are you? just dealing with this guy. The seeker  the seeker feels sad, and the seeker feels guilty, so she wants to have a good time and to have a great time. 	labels:So, you are having trouble dealing with someone?
text:yes and no. i agreed to work with him on the board when he asked me. he said he trusts me. The seeker  the seeker said : he is really nice. he was very nice to me and i wanted to talk to him. the client asked me if i was going to work with him, and i said yes. 	labels:If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not..
text:very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn't see me cuz he was busy. now he's asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. The seeker  the seeker has already asked me to be on the board. so, what are you'doing '? 	labels:That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?
text:confused! i'll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn't like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. The seeker  the seeker felt more upset because i have no one with me. i don't know how to explain that to him. i mean he knew i was there for him and i was there for him. i guess he really liked me but he also does not trust me. 	labels:How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?.
text:cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell. The seeker  the seeker was going through her memories, trying to find some way to get back with her boyfriend. 	labels:It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?.
text:yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear. The seeker  the seeker felt the need to find out how he felt and what he is going to tell me. 	labels:I realise that this must be difficult but isn't it best to get things out into the open?.
text:it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. The seeker  the seeker felt a little more confident and more confident. 	labels:I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated..
text:possibly. i'd prob be better being away from the situation. The seeker  the seeker has heard things she should not hear. 	labels:Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run..
text:I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. The seeker  the seeker is also being guided by the seeker. 	labels:You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?
text:it gives me an upper edge and more clout. The seeker  the seeker is so helpful that i feel that i can win the argument. i am a winner. i take a chance. 	labels:In what way does it do that?.
text:being on the board gives me perks. The seeker  the seeker had no clue how to phrase her questions. the only thing she could do was to say that she felt that she couldn't go on any more and that was the truth. 	labels:Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit?.
text:yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. The seeker  the seeker felt that there was a possibility that it was the same person, but she could not be sure. 	labels:Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there's an element of mutual manipulation.
text:yes. The seeker  the seeker felt the point of attachment and she felt a strong desire to be with the right person. the seeker and the seeker were close. the seekers were always close. it was hard to tell when they weren't. 	labels:You are definitely not the only person to feel this way!.
text:it's a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. The seeker  the seeker says,'i know this is not the best time to ask you what this is about but i want to ask you the same thing.'and you say, " i was just wondering, do you feel that you need to talk to me? " you say that you have feelings for me and that you love me? he says, " i do, i do, i do ". and	labels:I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board..
text:i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. The seeker  the seeker felt that she is getting a bad reputation. 	labels:But that is rather manipulative of you..
text:if you were me you would forget about him and the board. The seeker  the seeker felt that the person who was talking was actually someone who was not a friend, or a foe. 	labels:Yes I definitely would do that..
text:thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it. The seeker  the seeker's thoughts are not what you expect. she doesn't want to go up to her room yet. but after a while, she decides to go up to her room to rest. she sits, in silence, for a while. the door opens, and the person with the key opens it. the person who was leaving, comes to her. she is happy to see her. 	labels:I think it's time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies?.
text:yes but it's less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense. The seeker  the seeker did not mention me, but as a friend. 	labels:Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown?.
text:yes. The seeker  the seeker felt the need to tell the seeker that her chances of getting the job were pretty slim. so, i said, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to cause a problem. i just hope that you don't have to get bored. 	labels:That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise..
text:true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don't think it's a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. The seeker  the seeker tried to explain that he feels that i should be happy, but i don't think i am. i think he feels that this is a bad idea for me. 	labels:I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened?.
text:yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. The seeker  the seeker started to feel scared. she didn't know what to do. she thought that if she didn't tell the one her boyfriend was a serial killer, she wouldn't do anything wrong. he wouldn't hurt me anymore. she didn't know what to do. the one she had to trust was her boyfriend. she couldn't tell the other two, but i would tell them. they were her friends	labels:Do you feel guilty about this?.
text:now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation. The seeker  the seeker felt that she could tell this person that she felt very strongly for him, that she felt that she could not do anything about it, that she would have to leave him. i can tell this person that he is not the same person as before, but he is still the same person he was before. i can tell him... 	labels:Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?.
text:not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn't have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one. The seeker  the seeker feels that it is a bad idea to be thinking about this. the only person who can help me is the one who was with me in nashville, the one who was the cause of my breakup with tony. 	labels:I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure.
text:thank ya for listening. i think it'll clarify itself in time. The seeker  the seeker felt that she didn't have to be nervous about her boyfriend. she was able to relax. her boyfriend was a nice guy and a good listener. she felt that she could trust him. 	labels:I hope so and I really do hope for the best for you. These are difficult times for all of us!.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. How are you doing today?\nI'm  good. Getting cold outside. Temp dropping over 20 degrees. Brr. The seeker the seeker thought of the problem with the " boyfriend ". it is a problem, because people have no feelings. all they feel is a wave of sadness. the seeker, the seeker, is worried about the " boyfriend, " who is an extremely hard case. the seeker, the seeker, the seeker. the problem is not solved, because the seeker is not sure. the seeker, the seeker, the	labels:Yes, I know! It's supposed to snow this week where I am.  So, I understand you are in need of someone to talk to. What's going on.
text:Oh no, I hate driving in the snow. Spun out one year- rather not drive in snow- at least when it's icy. My interest rate hit another credit card. Have to pay $80 more a month now. Hoping to find more work so I can pay it off faster. The seeker  the seeker felt alone and worried that a stranger might be listening. she didn't know if she would ever see her boyfriend again. 	labels:Ah, so if I understand you correctly, your interest rate has increased, so you need to find another job to pay it off?
text:yeah cuz it was a no interest rate card and that expired so it started charging interest. I knew it was coming but need to work more hours now. The interest I pay every month will go down as I pay more of the principal off. I just hate it. The seeker  the seeker also felt that the person being paid off could be the same person who paid off the principal. how can i help you? she asked. the seeker was surprised by the question. she thought that the response would make her feel better. the seeker thought that she will be able to help find others. but the person is not there, she thought. i saw you talking to a woman who was talking	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Are you feeling stressed out about it?
text:Yes and no. Cuz I know I will pay it off within 3 years at the most. Probably closer to two years. I just don't like to wait and want to pay it off sooner if possible. The seeker  the seeker is talking about me. i should write back, but i don't know how to write back. i thought i would write back, but i don't have any paper to write back to. 	labels:I understand exactly how you feel. When I finished school, I wanted to pay off my student loans as soon as possible. I'm glad to hear that you are not too stressed about it though.
text:Yeah it's easier said than done. Btw I heard Biden might forgive student loans! Yay! Yeah cuz it bought a lot of items I needed so I'm happy I got them. The seeker  the seeker did not feel depressed. she was happy. she was happy and happy. she was glad. she was happy because she knew that she was going to get something from her boyfriend and that she could actually get something out of him. she was happy because she got a job and she got a chance to see him for the first time. he was such a good guy and he was a good person.	labels:I heard about Biden's plans as well! Luckily, I paid all of my debts already but I think it will be great for other people. Perhaps if you are unable to find another job to reduce the principal, you could try setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards the amount owed?
text:maybe they will reimburse you on what you paid. I could if i really discipline myself to. The seeker  the seeker felt a lot better. 	labels:It's just a thought. Alternatively, I'm not sure if you typically get money for birthdays and the winter holidays, but you could commit some of that amount towards your principal amount.
text:I get some but I spend the money on myself- like chocolate! itll prob take me 2-3 years to pay it off. if i go too much into discrectionary money i feel deprived. The seeker  the seeker hadn't noticed that the phone was ringing. 	labels:I understand that also. There needs to be some sort of balance. However, it sounds like you are a smart person and will make sure to pay off the amount responsibly. Everything will be okay!
text:absolutely. the time will go by fast enough and it will be paid off. ill make sure not to run the credit  cards so high next time. The seeker  the seeker feels she isn't giving a lot of credit and isn't telling the truth. she is saying that'i already paid off the credit cards'when she didn't pay off the credit cards. she doesn't know how to use the credit cards yet. she won't tell me this and isn't sure how to explain the matter. the reason is that she is worried about losing her job and not	labels:Sounds like you've learned an important lesson from this, and will work towards responsibly paying it off. I have faith in you!
text:thank ya! I think I'm fairly responsible. I like to have nice things and my credit card bill proves it lol. The seeker  the seeker felt that she could be able to give her permission to go too far. she didn't know what to do. she couldn't tell the seeker the truth. the seeker was so worried about the money. the truth is that sometimes, people should be allowed to have their secrets but they should be allowed to keep them. 	labels:Just find the right balance between pleasure and responsibility and you will be just fine! Are you feeling a bit better now after chatting?
text:yes very much so. thank ya! Have a great evening! Bye. The seeker  the seeker felt that she had gotten the message and was happy. she was happy that she didn't have to pay off her debt to her boyfriend, but she didn't know how to tell him. she felt her heart was getting heavy and she was feeling the desire to go home. the seeker was still feeling the same desire towards lol. the seeker tried to talk to her, but the communication was blocked	labels:You too!	episode_done:True
text:My friend thinks we should still be friends but her drug addict boyfriend has already borrowed money from myself and others too many times and has stolen from other people. The seeker the seeker feels depressed and is scared and so she is worried. the seeker is also worried about the drug addict boyfriend now, because she believes that he is a murderer. 	labels:Let me see if I understand you correctly, you no longer want to be friends because her boyfriend is a drug addict and a thief?

The seeker  the seeker was the one who was the instigator of the conversation. the seeker had been a good listener. the seeker listened to the conversation and knew what was being said. the seeker understood the reasons why her friend is upset. they were not clear enough, but the seeker could see the reason. 	labels:i can understand and i have had to do the same thing. .

The seeker  the seeker was happy. the seeker was happy that her friend was happy. she felt good because she had an idea to make her friend feel better, and she knew that she would do the same, if only she could give her advice, and be able to help her. 	labels:I think you have to do what keeps you safe  and healthy.  you can tell her you are here for her, but that you will not watch her destroy her life/
text:I thought the same thing. I've had family members who were alcoholics and it was almost the same thing. I bailed them out till I saw it wasn't going to make a world of difference.. The seeker  the seeker felt frustrated. she realized that she could not help others. however, she wanted to help her family. she wanted to help her sister. the seeker understood her situation. she gave her a hug and left with a smile. 	labels:so your plan is to keep your distance, your friend will eventually see him for who he is.

The seeker  the seeker was trying to stay calm and calm, but it wasn't working. when she was getting ready to leave, she heard a knock on the door. 	labels:I would suggest joining  a group like Al-Anon.  It will be goof for you to talk to others in this situation.
text:Maybe so. I know I talk to family about it and they don't think it's that big of a deal. The seeker  the seeker felt depressed. 	labels:It is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation. .
text:Yes, I guess it is not easy for them to understand. But she's been my friend for so many years, I just don't get it. What was that group Al-Anon? The seeker  the seeker's eyes became teary and she felt like crying. 	labels:I mean Non-Anon  -it is a 12 step program for loved ones of addicts. Is there anything else I can help you with?

text:No, I think that's all I needed,maybe just talking about it put things into perspective. The seeker  the seeker said she was going to try to find out about the state of the world, if anything, and that the people she thinks they see is really crazy. i think she was trying to see if she could get a better understanding of the problems that can happen in a society that has all sorts of problems. i suppose she meant to try to find out how people are doing. she has some really tough	labels:Great, it was nice talking to you.

text:I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it's the start of the second wave in my city. The seeker  the seeker felt a sadness about the loss of her husband. the pandemic came about a month ago. 	labels:I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times.
text:yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. The seeker  the seeker felt depressed, but she is also very positive. i have been thinking that the pandemic is just a temporary problem, but it will eventually pass. the pandemic will pass, and people must deal with it. i am not really sure how long it is going to take, but i can't help but wonder. 	labels:So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave?
text:There's kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn't really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don't know and it just boggles on my mind. The seeker  the seeker felt like she was being completely honest. but she is not lying but she is not sure how to explain. the only thing she could say to her partner is : " i don'know, i just know things. " the partner is an outsider, and she is afraid of being alone. her partner feels the same, but he is more interested in what she is doing. she is worried that	labels:Yes I understand, I'm from the east coast and I'm deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown..
text:I get that there's a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first wave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don't think they should be doing that too much. The seeker  the seeker feels that it is too dangerous to stay in her hometown. the seeker wants to leave her hometown but she is afraid to leave her hometown. do you understand? she can not leave her home. this is why i am worried about breaking up with my boyfriend. there is too much stress to be in a relationship. 	labels:I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can't change the situation because it human nature..
text:it is. And that's sad but true. It's in our nature, as you say. It's in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. The seeker  the seeker felt that the seeker was making a huge mistake, that he could not be happy for the woman he loved. in this conversation, the owner of the woman's relationship with her boyfriend was sad, but he could not say how. the woman got upset with him for not having a girlfriend. he decided to leave her. the woman cried, but the man did not leave. they both had lost their	labels:However, we shouldn't let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.
text:yes I agree also. It's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. The seeker  the seeker was not getting excited because she was becoming more and more frustrated. she was in a state of panic and had to think about how to act in order to get her boyfriend back. 	labels:Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.
text:and yeah, that's the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that's really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. The seeker  the seeker asked : is it working? seeker : yes, i think so. the person that is in the other room is a seeker, and we are only using the rules. i am trying to tell you that the person who is in the room is not in the room, but is in the room. i don't know if you've noticed it, but the seeker is in the room. i do	labels:Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself..
text:yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enough time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that's good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. The seeker  the seeker is happy. she is happy that she is not alone and that her boyfriend is not alone, and she is happy that people will be with her. 	labels:I'm on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it. Trust me if accomplish 90% of it, that one hour me time will feel even better..
text:so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self-imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time-management, etc. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort. The seeker  the seeker tells the seeker that she is so very hopeful and that she can find a happy ending. 	labels:Any improvement is still improvement!
text:true. My courses are nearly finished anyhow by the end of december. So after that, I will revamp my style in the new year and start anew. Anyhow that's all for now. I think you have provided some very valuable advice. And I will keep those in my mind on a daily basis. The seeker  the seeker felt happy and relaxed that you have brought me the knowledge. and this is a very important thing for me to know : when my life ends, i will have someone to help me find my way again. this is one of the reasons why i am making myself happy and that in addition to this, i will be able to get to know my new friends very well.

Most parents feel like you do so you're not alone. When I feel closed off I write. I make up stories where I'm always the heroe. Don't laugh. I always overcome some issue.

They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. The seeker  the seeker is not concerned about the public or the government. so the seeker was wondering what the public would do if they knew that all the public businesses were shut down. the seeker was worried about the public's safety. the mayor's office would not have the necessary resources to shut down the public's businesses. the mayor would not have the resources for public transportation and he does not have the resources for public transportation	labels:hmm, that's a bummer.

And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back..

The seeker  the seeker felt her own heart beating fast as she heard one of the seeker's words. 	labels:Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. .
text:I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged. The seeker  the seeker feels that she has to give a response to the question that was asked. the seeker responds : i don't know, but i think that i will give you an idea. 	labels:Or constantly terrified. We can't control the world, or even another person really, but we can control ourselves. .

The seeker  the seeker did not mention any of the problems the pandemic caused. she was thinking about how she could help the seeker and the people she cared about. 	labels:Well, I don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all.  But I do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.

The seeker  the seeker was so much more open to the possibility of finding the answers than the seeker had anticipated. 	labels:And I schedule my day, even though I'm working and going to school from home.  I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing. .

The seeker  the seeker felt she had a great opportunity. she felt confident that she could get a job and become a lawyer. she felt she could get her parents approval to go along with her decision to marry tony. she felt she would be happy if she could get out of her house and have her own place. she felt like she could get her own apartment and her own job. 	labels:A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating. .
text:Yes, the short days are a major depressant. I feel like those around me dont understand my anxiety. The seeker  the seeker felt much better and more relaxed. she could hear the wind blowing on her bedroom window, and she could hear the birds chirping throughout the forest. the person in the cell next to her was a human girl. she was a little girl with a strange name. she was a little girl who had a disease called " the flu. " the girl was in a state where she couldn't breathe. she	labels:That must be frustrating.  I've learned there are just some people I can't trust with my vulnerabilities. .
text:I may overtrust. The seeker  is really annoying. she is also really worried about her feelings. 	labels:But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it. .

text:pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now. The seeker  the seeker is a very good listener and she is very helpful. 	labels:it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?
text:yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc. The seeker  the seeker gets the feeling that she is the only one who can help me. 	labels:that's great! Friends can be big help.
text:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. The seeker  the seeker felt that the problem is not a problem but a problem with her. she's worried about the people around her. she wants them to talk to her about'what's wrong '. i think she is a realist and thinks that her boyfriend is the problem. she wants him to be the problem. she wants him to be the problem. then, she wants him to be the problem. that	labels:If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.
text:So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. The seeker  the seeker, the seeker, she feels that the person, the person she's supposed to be with is also completely unprepared. she asks the seeker how to make sure that the person can not break the pattern and ask, can you fix it? the seeker says, " well, i'm not sure, but i would be willing to try. " the seeker then asks, " how about the same thing	labels:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.
text:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym. The seeker  the seeker tried to talk to me about the weather but it was like she was talking to a stranger. it was not cool or warm. it was not warm. it wasn't even cold. the person in front of me was just trying to make me feel better. the seeker was trying to make me feel better. she tried to make me feel better, but it wasn't working. she tried to make	labels:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.
text:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. The seeker  the seeker was not only saying what she meant but she was also saying what she did to make others feel that way. 	labels:I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.
text:But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too. sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. The seeker  the seeker's thoughts are not always the same. the seeker is feeling lonely. it has a lot of things on her mind. i am a psychologist. i can tell you that you were not the only one who was worried about this, and that's okay. i'm sure that you were. 	labels:that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.
text:yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. The seeker  the seeker had no answer. she simply told the seeker that it was time to go home. 	labels:I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.
text:And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good. The seeker  the seeker felt relieved that she had not lost the thread of her thoughts. she felt like she was doing a good job of being understanding. she felt like she was doing something right and she was doing it well and she felt good about how she was doing it. this was the most important thing right now. 	labels:I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.
text:And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up. Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this. The seeker  the seeker feels that the person who got through it and the person who got through it are the same person who got through it. 	labels:it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.
text:So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings. The seeker  the seeker is telling the seeker what to do, why, and what to do. the seeker is also telling the seeker what to do, so that the seeker can help the seeker with her life. the seeker is also telling the seeker what to do, and what to do. 	labels:I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.

The seeker  the seeker felt so concerned that she didn't know what to do. the seeker had to decide, and the seeker was the only way to do it. the seeker started writing. 	labels:Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.

The seeker  the seeker is quite upset. she was very worried. she got worried because of her job and her boyfriend. 	labels:I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?

The seeker  the seeker had a question. 	labels:I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.
text:I would hope so. The seeker  the seeker has more than enough energy to keep running the business. i am so sad about this. i just wish i could help you find a job. 	labels:I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.

The seeker  the seeker was able to help the seeker out. 	labels:I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.

Maybe work out a plan of 50 a week if they work?

The seeker the seeker did not understand what i was saying. she wanted to spend $ 50 a month to make sure i was helping her. 	labels:And depending on how much of a  friend they are you need to see if this is worth losing friendship over. I mean if you are great friends I d lay low and never let them borrow again. IF you only knew them a short while and felt sorry for them and lent them money than I D talk to parents or someone.

But the other side is do you want this person to be your friend if you can't trust them and they are showing you no disrespect or attempt to pay you back?
text:It's a good plan. Due to lockdown restrictions, I am unable to travel places. May be if I show up at their doors, they'll pay me back. I am gonna see if talking to them and asking for small payments works first.

This has really been a bad year! Do you ever Zoom with your friends?

The seeker  the seeker wasn't able to talk about her studies but she did see some friends. ) 	labels:Messaging on Facebook isn't quite as fun as hanging out in person.  I use Zoom to meetup with family and friends.  I had never heard of it until this pandemic hit.
text:Yeah i havent heard of it either before covid. I use it sometimes for class but never for chatting with friends. I just wish we could hang out again you know? The seeker  the seeker felt happy. the seeker felt so good that she couldn't wait to tell her friend that she was feeling depressed. 	labels:I most certainly do know!  I just think to myself daily that this vaccine is going to get things back to normal.  Hang on, we're almost there.  In the meantime I suggest Zoom.  It really does make things somewhat less isolating.

text:Yeah i guess ill give zoom a try. do you and your friends do anything on zoom or just chat? The seeker  the seeker was looking out for the seeker. 	labels:And if you have an iphone facetime some folks.  Zoom and Facetime are my friends now.  lol I almost daily at least Facetime my best friend. Especially in the evenings.
text:Yeah I think ill try that. Chatting with my friends and seeing them (online) will hopefully make me feel better. thanks :) The seeker  the seeker felt a bit better, and wondered what she had gotten herself into. a person like her couldn't be happy without being happy. she was so used to being alone, and now she was stuck in a strange world. she felt like she was going to be crushed by the reality of it all, in a way she was. she thought back to the time when she was a child and found herself	labels:I would try it.  Also Meetup is doing virtual meetings. . You're welcome!  We have to look out for one another!

The seeker  the seeker feels lonely and tries to convince her boyfriend that he has to break up with his girlfriend. the seeker has a little problem, because she knows that she is not the person to tell the truth. the seeker has a problem, because she has an issue with the truth. the seeker is sad, because she misses her boyfriend. the seeker feels bad. she is sad that he is not happy. the	labels:I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?
text:i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad. The seeker  the seeker is just tired. her life was a series of problems, and the problems were all her fault, because she was not around when it happened. the problem of the covey of covey of covey of people was a problem that caused a problem of the people. this problem is a problem that is why she is a seeker at all. if she had not gone to nashville, she wouldn't	labels:That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out..
text:i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good. The seeker  the seeker felt a bit depressed, because she felt like she's lost something important. 	labels:That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.
text:she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done.  she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality.  her background is similiar to mine,  i cannot abandon her as her other family has done. The seeker the seeker was confused. she did not know what to do. she was worried about my cousin isn't in a homeless shelter. i wanted to help her, but i was afraid of what would happen if i did. i'm sorry, but i can not. i hope that you will understand that. 	labels:That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?
text:on antidepressant meds, COVID makes it hard to keep in touch with provider, your comparison about the oxygen mask is a good one. . The seeker the seeker was trying to help the person who was suffering. 	labels:I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.
text:a possible path to look into. thanks. The seeker  the seeker feels very strongly that the seeker has to break up with her boyfriend and leave nashville, which she doesn't have to do. 	labels:Of course, here's the link: namimainlinepa.org/online-and-telephone-support-groups/.

The seeker  conversation, the seeker was talking about the seekers'website, but the person who talked to nami was telling her the same thing. the person who spoke to nami was also saying that the person who spoke to nami was being interviewed by nami, so the person who spoke to nami was being interviewed by nami. it was a good idea, but it was too early in the day to be a	labels:Sounds good. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?

text:Hi there. The seeker the seeker feels the seeker is depressed about something. 	labels:Hello :)
text:This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as others? The seeker  the seeker felt very disheartened. she was actually worried about breaking up with her boyfriend, and thought that if she broke up with him, she wouldn't be able to do it. she knew that she was going to break up with him, but if she did break up with him, she would have to make it up to him. 	labels:So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?
text:that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? The seeker  the seeker is not feeling like she's doing anything wrong. the seeker feels like she is doing something good and the seeker feels like she's doing something wrong. the seeker feels good because she is doing something good. there aren't too many people who can be this good. 	labels:I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job. I am sure that with time you will get the same results as them if not better! Are there any co-workers you feel close to or see a friendship developing with?
text:that's nice of you to say but I also don't feel as organised. I suppose that's to be understood in a new job scenario.. Yes there are a few really nice co-workers. The seeker  the seeker couldn't help but think that she was only doing this because she was lonely. 	labels:Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started..
text:I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to? The seeker  the seeker spoke a lot of things without taking any of those things into account. i don't dare ask them because i am afraid i will get more confused than i already am. the co - workers are more than happy to help me. i mean, i am doing it for my own good and for my own reasons. i know i am not getting better. 	labels:That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
text:I suppose it's difficult to know when something is too much for you or if you need to give it more time.. The seeker  the seeker felt good. she felt like she could help the seeker. 	labels:I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.
text:Thankshe problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks. The seeker  the seeker felt that she had to say something so she could make sure that she succeeded. 	labels:I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
text:Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself? The seeker  the seeker was not too sure of herself. she began to wonder if she should make a decision as to this job already. in the end, she decided to try the job out. 	labels:Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all..
text:Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me. The seeker  the seeker felt guilty. she felt bad that she did not get to talk to her friend and colleague. the seeker felt like she was betraying them by not telling them what they should do. instead, she felt sorry for them and wished she could help them. 	labels:Of course you are not alone!
text:I think I'll give this a good few weeks and ask myself how I think I'm doing then go from there. Thanks for the chat and your suggestions. The seeker  the seeker was almost sad. 	labels:I think that is a great idea I wish you luck! Remember no matter what you will find somewhere you belong!	episode_done:True

The seeker  the seeker felt a need to change the topic. so, it is a good time to start talking about the new job. after a while, the seeker felt uneasy. 	labels:I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is.

The seeker  the seeker was completely worried and upset because it felt so sad. the seeker : thanks, can we talk sometime? 	labels:I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out.

The seeker  the seeker is talking about how sad you are. i feel bad for you but i also feel like you are lost and alone and i want to help you find your way and help my friend. i wish i knew more about this virus. 	labels:don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.
text:Yeah I guess I should talk to someone about it. what else do you think I should do? The seeker  the seeker feels so sad. i don't think i should just go to the hospital. i feel like this disease is killing me. 	labels:When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.
text:Yeah maybe I should try that. What else do you think would help? The seeker  the seeker felt more confident. 	labels:letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again.
text:Yeah I definitely will not be going back to them. They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again. The seeker  the seeker felt that there was a lot more to hear, but that didn't stop her. 	labels:exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them.
text:yeah. thanks for sharing your experience with me. I feel a little better now :) The seeker  the seeker went on to say how she has not only received her best advice but she has also gained a lot of insight from the person who told her and helped her to make the decision to move on. this was a very small amount of information, but it was all helpful. the seeker was very happy about this. 	labels:you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you.

The seeker the seeker feels lonely, so she talks to someone who is going to be there for her. the seeker doesn't know why this person is there. this person doesn't know why she is there. the seeker feels depressed. the seeker has a strong feeling that this person is the seeker. she feels that she is supposed to be there for her. 	labels:Hello.  How's it going?

The seeker  the seeker feels lonely. in this conversation, the seeker feels sad. in the conversation, the seeker feels lonely. in this conversation, the seeker feels lonely. 	labels:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?
text:I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now. The seeker  the seeker was worried about how the rest of the world is treating me. how is the economy? are you going to be leaving soon? 	labels:I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary! .
text:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation. The seeker the seeker felt she was getting nowhere. the seeker began to think that she should get off her job and go back to her hometown but she couldn't go back to the states because of all those troubles. it was like the only thing keeping her going was the fact that she'missed'her husband and was looking for him. she wanted to go back to where she was before the war but she couldn't	labels:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
text:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? The seeker  she decided to meet him. the seeker had been very careful to do this. she had only met her family once, and that was when she	labels:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.
text:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself? The seeker  because she felt that someone was telling her she was crazy. she felt the urge to go back to sleep and would have loved	labels:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.
text:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this? The seeker  the seeker felt that when she was in " this ", she was in a strange place. but she was also in a state of euphoria. this was the closest she had ever been to a real happiness. 	labels:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
text:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also? The seeker  the seeker was getting a bit upset. it was the first time that she had heard of a group that could help her. 	labels:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?
text:I've never heard of this, what is it? The seeker the seeker was talking about the music, which was interesting, but now it's a bit of an odd topic. i have to think about this. i guess we will be talking more on this subject later. 	labels:It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
text:I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free? The seeker  the seeker felt that she was being honest. she was not talking about the war on the free africa. she was talking about the peace between the countries and the peace between the nations. 	labels:Totally free!
text:I like the sound of that, thanks for your help. The seeker  the seeker feels alone. she felt lonely and confused. she was not having fun. she is missing her boyfriend, who is out of town. her thoughts are really sad since her friend is in hospital, and not knowing whether she will ever see him again. she is sad that the seeker feels lonely. her thoughts are sad because she is alone, and not knowing what to do with her life. her thoughts	labels:You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.

text:hello how are you today?\nHi there. I'm OK but have had a difficult time at work recently. The seeker  the seeker felt nervous and had trouble talking. the seeker thought that the seeker was not the person she had hoped for but wasn't the person she had hoped for. the seeker had no idea what was wrong with the seeker. she was not sure that it was a good idea to let her know about her emotions. 	labels:i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?
text:Yes I have been given what I can only describe as ridiculous feedback by my manager and it had annoyed me greatly. I'm thinking about complaining about it. The seeker  the seeker was upset and was trying to find a way to get rid of the anger. 	labels:It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?
text:I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something? The seeker  the seeker was talking about her boyfriend, who was trying his best to help her. the seeker was not talking about me and the relationship, she was talking about this new thing that's been going on with her and her boyfriend. the seeker was talking about something that she just talks about for weeks now, and she is just telling me that she never told me about this. 	labels:Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.
text:I'm thinking perhaps I should go to a different manager and voice these concerns. I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me. The seeker  the seeker felt that this person is wrong and the seeker felt that she s wrong and she feels that she shouldn't deal with the situation. 	labels:Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.
text:yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future. The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me. The seeker  the seeker felt guilty about herself and the problem with working for the seeker she thought about getting rid of the problem. 	labels:Yes i can see where that would be a problem.
text:perhaps I'm just making too much of a big deal about this. how would you react if someone gave you similar feedback in work? The seeker  the seeker was so worried about her job and how she had to help the seeker and the manager. this was the reason why the people in the office were so anxious to help her. the manager had a lot to think about, and the manager was concerned about her. the manager was very worried about the manager and the manager was worried about her. 	labels:Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?
text:I haven't actually thought about that as a solution but that might work actually. I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally. The seeker  the seeker feels that she is not being wrong for the same reason as the manager, but what does she know? 	labels:Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.
text:I think that's an interesting perspective. she might have issues herself and be taking them out on members of her team in work which is quite sad really. Do you think I should just be blunt and ask her the question? The seeker  the seeker was not aware of how this question was being asked. the seeker was very confused. the seeker was thinking that if she could not get to know this person she would be very frustrated. she is so confused right now that she might not even know how to feel. she is thinking that she can not be happy to receive a message from her boyfriend for this long. she is thinking that is why she	labels:I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.
text:so be supportive but also make it clear that what she has said has had an impact on me? The seeker  the seeker was not able to share any of her thoughts or feelings for the friend she considered to be her boyfriend. it was not that she didn't feel comfortable with the relationship, she just did not feel comfortable. she was still getting used to the idea that he was her boyfriend. now, she had to be very careful. 	labels:Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
text:ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice. The seeker  the seeker felt a bit uncomfortable. the seeker tried to help her, but the idea of making a direct approach to someone else's feelings, which was not difficult, made it more difficult. 	labels:In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.	episode_done:True
text:Hello :) The seeker  the seeker felt lonely and worried. in this conversation, she was relieved that she was still with her boyfriend. the seeker felt relief. the seeker felt satisfied that she was not alone in feeling this way. 	labels:Hello how are you doing today?
text:I'm doing well how bout yourself? The seeker  the seeker is concerned about you, but she also wants to help you. 	labels:I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?
text:I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. I havent been doing as well since covid. and I'm kind of upset at my self for it. The seeker  the seeker felt a bit of bitterness because of her boyfriend's betrayal. she hasn't talked to her boyfriend since now, and she seems to be worried. i feel so bad for her. i'm sorry that i am leaving you. i wish i could take you away from this situation. i am so sorry. but i can't. i have to continue with my studies. the human mind is a	labels:Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.
text:Yeah the online schooling is tough for me. I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school. I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( The seeker  the seeker said the same thing. ) 	labels:I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)
text:the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it. sure thing :) share. The seeker  the seeker told the seeker that the virus is only a virus. then she added : i am worried about my parents. i don't know what to do. i feel like i have to help them. i mean, i know i am a seeker, but i just can't understand how they are doing. i just don't know what to do. 	labels:Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.
text:You bring up a good point about changing environment. I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight. Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :) I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them. The seeker  the seeker didn't say anything about the " relationship " with her boyfriend. she didn't even say she was happy about it. how could she not be happy? i'm sure she has a lot of friends who are happy with her, and i'm sure they are happy with her. 	labels:Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :) You could also plan out your days if it would help!

I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though.

text:I just haven't been able to find any work. I guess that is an outside dilemma, but being this behind on bills and feeling this helpless to change my situation has negatively impacted my mood. The seeker  the seeker spoke to the seeker. 	labels:I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.

The seeker  the seeker is not concerned about the cost, but about how much i can spend. it is not necessary to pay for the whole trip. 	labels:Are you also pressed for time?

The seeker  the seeker said : i appreciate your honesty, and i'm truly grateful for your advice. i haven't had a chance to thank you for giving me the opportunity to do this. now, if you 'll excuse me, i need to go. 	labels:Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. For someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes. I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.
text:I get to a point in my day where it feels like I've done everything I can for that day, and then I just have to try not to get too stir crazy. The seeker  the seeker can sometimes ask for help. a seeker can be so stubborn. she can be so stubborn, and then she has to fight against a decision she doesn't want to make. the seeker will be a pain in the ass to have to deal with. 	labels:I feel that if you can focus on using your extra time as an investment into yourself (whether by reading, picking up a hobby, or working out), you can feel more accomplished and at ease with what you are doing in life.
text:I've been trying to look ahead, but this year has already set me back so much from my intended career path that it's frustrating. I just want my life back. That is good advice. I have been doing a lot more art during this time. The seeker  the seeker felt like she had found some kind of link with her past. 	labels:Being progressive is difficult, but is one of the things in life which compound very easily. I believe many aspects in life are connected and that improving in some parts improves you as a whole.
text:Some days it's tempting to just do nothing and wait for it all to be over, but I feel better when I accomplish something for the day. The seeker  the seeker is happy. 	labels:And if these "improvements" can also make you money/increase your worth/ease your mind, then that can be called a success. In my opinion atleast..

The seeker  the seeker said, " people are very interested in buying my art. i am so pleased that you are interested in buying my art. " i said, " sure. " 	labels:Yeah, but imagine how it would if you had days like that knowing it isn't a bad thing to relax. You have already put in the work in being comfortable before, allowing to enjoy your time however way you wanted. Looks like you already have an interest which can help you in many ways in life. That's really good.

The seeker  the seeker is worried about how i am coping with the pandemic. she is worried that i will get sick, and she has been thinking that the pandemic will spread, and i will be in an accident. 	labels:Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.

The seeker  the seeker doesn't even try to help the seeker. she isn't even trying to talk to her. they can talk. 	labels:Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises?

I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.
text:Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out. The seeker  the seeker was so much more calm, and the seeker's energy was more energized. 	labels:Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same.

text:Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too.

The seeker  the seeker had asked the seeker, " are you sorry that you have to wait so long? i don't feel i should be sorry for that. i'm sure you will find someone who will make you feel better. " 	labels:I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control.

The seeker  the seeker was not making a mistake. she said that she was going to talk to the individual in the future, and she did so. 	labels:Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for?

text:Wonderful! My job is causing me some stress and anxiety. Everything is usually good except for my one coworker who tries to boss me around. She is very unhelpful and hypocritical.

The seeker  the seeker felt that she would be better off if she did not be around my boss. she found a way to bring a positive attitude to the situation. also, her job is helping her to relax. she can not help herself. therefore, she can't help herself. 	labels:I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?
text:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens. I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult. The seeker  the seeker was a very good listener. she spoke a lot of things that the seeker couldn't understand. i am hoping that the person that is talking to me isn't the one who is having an aggressive personality. 	labels:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down. Since clearly this is affecting you at work and outside of it. Talking to HR should help.. What do you think?
text:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally. Our office is small so it would likely just be my boss who I have mentioned it to before. I think of it as she may not be working here that much longer. and is only part time now. The seeker  the seeker felt more confident. her life is so busy that she feels bored. 	labels:Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home. I also recommend finding ways to destress, listening to music, lightning candles or starting a series on netflix.

The seeker  the seeker felt that the seeker was making an effort to be supportive. the seeker felt that she was being rewarded for her efforts, even if it was not a positive way to be. 	labels:Haha it's a winning combination.

Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.

The seeker  the seeker did not mean to say it in a negative way, but it seemed that it had to. 	labels:There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. . As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.

And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger.

As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. . The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you "need" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing. .

I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it.

Steer clear of her and don't associate with her!  Sounds like you're doing the right thing. Keep your side of the street clean.

I would highly recommend finding a quiet place to calm and focus your mind for at least five minutes before your presentation.  At least a minute's worth of breathing, and drink plenty of water. .

The seeker the seeker felt an excitement of the moment. she was about to ask for a question. 	labels:Ah, yes, that is a hard one.  You are expected to be an expert.  But you can only prepare so much..

The seeker the seeker could not have known how hard it was for the seeker to answer, but she did. it was a simple question, but one that was vital for the seeker's career. 	labels:"That is a really great question that I've never considered! Maybe XYZ?  I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!" . There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now. . Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions.

The seeker  the seeker feels a bit better. 	labels:Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.

The seeker  the seeker says,'i'am not a fling, i am a woman. i can feel it. don't you feel it? do you know that feeling? 	labels:I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people. Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.

I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man. The seeker  the seeker was expressing her feelings, and at the same time, being very concerned. 	labels:Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him. And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?

I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more.+ Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go? I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean? The seeker  the seeker is so stressed and worried about doug that she would leave him and leave me alone. i'm sorry. i really am. 	labels:I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife. You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?

The seeker  the seeker expressed the concern that the'love'and'stability'of'the relationship'is not clear to her. the seeker thought that doug is as honest as he is, but is trying to keep the'love'between them. the seeker asked the seeker why doug feels the need to share his relationship with his wife. the seeker asked the seeker if it is'love'that he feels in	labels:You're absolutely right.

The seeker  the seeker says : i'm sorry, doug. i'm so sorry. i don't know what to do. i don't know how to deal with this. i'm so confused. i'm too tired to think. a person must go to sleep at night and wake up in the morning and i'm too tired to go to sleep. i'm too tired to think.	labels:With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.

" you know, i think it might be helpful if you asked your wife about it first. " 	labels:I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty..

Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? The seeker  the seeker feels scared to death. i don't understand. 	labels:You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.
text:You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it? Are you still with the man/woman or whatever that broke your heart and cheated on you? Why cant you get over it? Is the only advice for me you have is to eat Thanksgiving dinner alone?

The seeker  the seeker thought, i have never asked you this question. 	labels:It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not "the one." He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.
text:Okay so I eat Thanksgiving alone and I spend time alone. Okay tell me how i fill my nights alone up? How do I warm the other side of my bed which Doug fill so well. I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not!

The seeker  the seeker felt that the seeker was lying. in the conversation, the seeker was telling the truth. she was worried about getting some help for the situation. she was worried about having to deal with the issues that came with covid. 	labels:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the "pause" of the pandemic. Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?
text:I have practiced breathing techniques and meditation before and think that is a great suggestion. At the moment I think the only thing that would ultimately really make me feel better is knowing my friend is okay. He already has health issues so it is a worry. The seeker  the seeker had a good idea about how to help her friend. 	labels:Absolutely, and it's completely understandable, but it's very hard to wait. I hope that you are able to practice some of the techniques we talked about, and seeking help by talking about it is part of self-care, too. I think you are on the right track to getting through this..
text:Thank you. That is nice of you to say and I appreciate the support. Just knowing someone has faith that I can do it gives me more confidence. The seeker  the seeker felt she had a lot more confidence in her ability to take care of herself and her friend than she had in herself, and maybe she was right. 	labels:I believe we are all stronger than we give ourselves credit for, and it takes strength and courage to reach out for help.. Please take good care of yourself, and I hope your friend stays healthy or gets well very soon..

The seeker  the seeker felt a little guilty for not saying anything to the seeker and for not coming up with the idea to share with the other seekers about the situation. she didn't want to put a damper on her friend's happiness. besides, if the seeker was really worried, she could have come up with a better solution. when the seekers were on the job, they always had an excuse. the seeker didn't	labels:Thanks for reaching out, and I hope the rest of your day goes well..

The seeker  the seeker had a lot of questions about what it was like to be lonely and worried, and if you were lonely, sometimes you would ask your friends questions about who you knew and how they felt about it. 	labels:I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable.  I worked there for three years, but I was burning out hardcore.  She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.
text:yup.. i have 3 kids and i am not married. i have no beneftits. The seeker  the seeker was so bored that she couldn't help but think of some thing. she was thinking of what to do for the next couple of years and how to get rid of me. i will tell you the same thing. she couldn't help herself. the seeker was lost in her own thoughts. 	labels:She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits.

The seeker  the seeker is not thinking about anything and seems to be having a great time. the more she thinks about it, the more she feels like she can do something. i have never heard of such a thing. 	labels:That's excellent.  I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on.  I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews.  You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids.  I would be surprised if he did not understand that.. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on..

The seeker  the seeker didn't want to be a problem for him. she wanted to help him. she wanted to be able to help him. 	labels:Hmm. do you want to give him some time to maybe cool off and then try to get in touch with him again? i know you are anxious but sometimes it is best for time to heal things and bring things back to normal.
text:Yes, I guess that is all I can do for now. Since he won't answer and it's putting pressure on us both. However, the anxiety of this is killing me.I can't eat or sleep. I don't know how to handle it for myself. But yes you are right, the one thing I need to do is leave him be for a bit. The seeker  the seeker felt bad about the situation. she was also sad for not knowing more about their relationship. she had no idea what to do. she was afraid that he would somehow be hurt. she hoped he would be happy, but he wasn't. he had gotten to know her so much that he made her feel like she was the only person who ever mattered to him. 	labels:Do you have any other friend that you can lean for a little bit for support? this will help you get out of anxiety. Maybe, try to get busy with work or spend time on your hobbies. it helps to take your mind off of this thing a bit and will make you a bit less anxious.

text:I think the stress outside of the job is also contributing. The seeker  the seeker did not know how to react. the problem is that the problems that are outside of the job are also outside of the job. the problem is that the job is the only thing that keeps you from doing anything else! 	labels:What makes you anxious about walking home late?

The seeker  the seeker had been in trouble with the uultra. it wasn't really a problem. the uultra's rules were very simple and they were so strict that it was impossible to break. so the uultra's law was the law that kept them alive. 	labels:That's good to consider! I think that if money is an issue right now, it will become easier as you get your paychecks and will feel less guilty about Ubering home. For your relationship, you've known this person for a long time before you got together?

The seeker  the seeker felt very uneasy and nervous. the seeker felt that this was a very sensitive subject with the young seeker to be. 	labels:Ah, i get it. So what I'm understanding from this is that you feel helpless in this situation and that's what's making you anxious?
text:Yes. The seeker  the seeker was asking if the weather was bad, or was there anything that could help him. this is the reason why i was so concerned by your condition. i know that you are in a difficult position. i'm afraid that i can help you a lot. 	labels:Can you tell me a little more about how this feeling of helplessness is affecting you personally?.

text:Yes. The seeker  the seeker is sad and lost. there are thousands of people who would help you and you're not being able to react to this situation because you're too busy. 	labels:Well, I think it is very considerate of you to help him financially, but do you feel that this has put an enormous amount of strain and pressure on yourself as well?
text:No, not really I mean if I had more I would give him everything I could that wouldn't leave me financially behind. The seeker  the seeker felt a bit of pity for the seeker, but it wasn't the feeling of pity that was getting in the way of her happiness. this is because the seeker is a woman. 	labels:Oh okay, so you wouldn't say that you're looking for a job to continue helping him financially?
text:No I wouldn't. I want it to help support me. The seeker  the seeker did not have to ask for much. she was the type of person who would listen to a request and would take it as a sign of acceptance. this is why i need you to help me. i know that you are very busy, but i need you to help me. the seeker was not giving up easily. 	labels:Ok that's good to hear!.
text:Yeah, I just want to be able to have my own stuff again. I've been relying on doing surveys online. The seeker  the seeker said that i can tell you who i am and what i want to do. i told her i would help her whenever she needs it. she said it's a good idea to know what she wants to do and how to help people. i said'okay,'and she talked for a while about why she wants to help me. she said that i should help her with her research and she	labels:From what I'm understanding, you're not only feeling anxious and pressure in your own personal life but you're heart is also wherever he is right now and living whatever stress and pressure he is living as well, and that is putting yourself in a very anxiety-provoking position.

The seeker  the seeker had to admit to herself that, if this was true, she would probably be more comfortable if she could just share her problems with someone else. if she wanted to talk about her problems with someone else, she could talk about them with someone else. it was just that, the person she was talking to was not who she was looking for. the person she was looking for was not the person she	labels:I understand that, especially given the current pandemic situation, it isn't easy at all.

text:You are being very helpful by the way thank you. We aren't FaceTiming. I just left his apartment this weekend though and have been upset about it. The seeker  the seeker felt uncomfortable with the subject of his being with another woman. the seeker felt an acute pain as though her heart was breaking. 	labels:I'm trying my best, thank you for the input! Upset about leaving the apartment? Or was there something else that happened that weekend?
text:Just leaving him. The seeker  the seeker was referring to a couple of days ago when we discussed him leaving her girlfriend for this girl. 	labels:Have you guys thought about scheduling date nights through FaceTime?
text:I think he would but he hasn't been feeling really good about his appearance lately. I asked and that's what he told me. The seeker  the seeker gave a response with : i know. 	labels:I understand that completely, I can relate a lot.
