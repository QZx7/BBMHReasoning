text:Good Evening.\nHello. The seeker has spent a lot of time to find their relationship. The seeker can tell he feels more alone. For now, the seeker is focusing on the goal.	labels:How are you?
text:I'm pretty stressed out actually. The seeker feels stressed and worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?
text:Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates. The seeker feels worried and worried about not getting laid. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation needs to be handled.	labels:Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?
text:Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75% The seeker feels stressed. The supporter told the seeker that her job is not done yet, and that she can get a job before it happens.	labels:What was you're score?
text:I got a 62% on the test. The seeker feels overwhelmed by his anxiety. The supporter could tell the seeker the test was not his best. The seeker did not feel well.	labels:That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed. .
text:Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class. The seeker felt scared of losing his jobs. The supporter could not help but feel as though the seeker is in danger and in need of help.	labels:Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?
text:Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions. The seeker receives a message about what the seeker wants to do. He or she can start talking about how they want to do it.	labels:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise....
text:Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The supporter would like to know how they can help the seeker.	labels:OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!.
text:Yeahhh. Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice. made me feel ebtter. The seeker feels extremely emotional about the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker was concerned about going through this.	labels:If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a "Can-Do" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns! You're so very welcome!.	episode_done:True

text:Im not sure. why would my friend let it happen, and why would my boyfriend choose to disrespect me in that manner. The seeker felt scared. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:you've had some time to sit with this, i understand completely that you are disgusted, but how have your felings changed since you found out?
text:Changed in what aspect? I still detest both of them. and to think he tried to emotionally blackmail me with it. The seeker felt anxious. It's scary to think about the person who hurt him.	labels:are you spending time with them like you did before, have you talked to them>
text:No im not. I cant stand either of them. The seeker feels anxious about being with his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that he needs to move on from the relationship with the person he loves.	labels:even though it doesn't feel like it, affairs have little to nothing to do with the people who get hurt the most. it's not about you even though you got hurt the most.
text:Okay. The seeker feels angry at the person for breaking up with him. The supporter should try to help the seeker get back to work.	labels:the anger and betrayal are natural feelings.
text:So you think i should have a conversation with them? The seeker felt upset and scared about breaking up with his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is very serious.	labels:if you want to maintain relationships, then you woudl have further converstations, but if you are ready to move on, nothing they can say will change what you need to do - move on.
text:I am not interesting in either relationship anymore. The seeker feels depressed and disheartened about the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is changing.	labels:it sounds like you have moved on if you aren't talking to them, is that right?
text:and i also havent spoken to no one about it. The seeker feels frustrated and frustrated about how his life is going.	labels:so i'd spend my energy working on myself.

The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is going smoothly.	labels:are there friends you can talk to about this? your parents? siblings? seek out a support group, people you know who can and will take care of you when youare feeling low.
text:Siblings yes. Nut i didnt go into full details. yesss. thank you so much for listening and advicing. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that they shouldn't have to worry about their relationship with their friends or family.	labels:people who care about you often don't need the details, just that you need them.
text:Right. I just told them it didnt work out. and i am not giving details about reasons neither am i talking about my friend. The seeker feels frustrated and the supporter could tell the seeker that if they don't give the support, the seeker will lose his job.	labels:and that's enough. until you are ready, you don't need to elaborate.
text:yes you are right. The seeker feels that the support group isnt helping him. The support group isnt helping him. The support group is not helping him.	labels:it's really nobody ele's business.
text:yeaa you know people sometimes wana mind your own business. The seeker felt afraid of losing her job. The supporter could not help but feel scared.	labels:it's easier to see where others are going than it is ourselves sometimes. because there's not the emotion clouding the way.
text:yes. you have been of tremendous help in helping me move around my thoughts. The seeker feels depressed and scared about not being able to move around my thoughts.	labels:once you get the raw emotion out of a situation, it's easier to see things like they really are.
text:i guess so. The seeker felt relieved with his job. In this conversation, the seeker felt relieved with his job. In this conversation, the seeker felt relieved with his job. In this conversation, the seeker felt relieved with his job.	labels:i'm glad. plesae stay safe.	episode_done:True

text:My girlfriend and I recently broke up so it has got me a little down. I'm glad that you're having a good weekend so far. The seeker feels frustrated and depressed. The support and support is not mentioned.	labels:Sorry to hear that.  Breakups are rough I can say as I've been through a couple myself. How long were you two together?
text:We were together for two years. It's been a pretty tough week but I've been trying to go on walks with my dog & whatnot to keep my mind off thigns. things* The seeker feels stressed and depressed.	labels:Fur babies are definitely good in bad times.  It's good that you're taking the time out for yourself. That takes strength!
text:That's one of the things that I am trying to focus on - being mindful of myself. It's been helpful that my city is on Lockdown so I'm able to go on walks & spend some time by myself. The seeker feels anxious about her job and she can tell the seeker that she will feel anxious and stressed that days are not as good as days.	labels:Oh that's awesome - despite the circumstances.  Are you in the US?
text:No, thank heavens. My government is handling things a bit better here in Canada. Being out of work is tough, but at the same time I get a bunch of time to myself.. The seeker is stressed and worried about staying positive. The supporter could tell us what's going on and how he can help.	labels:I'm jealous.  hehe I often wonder what our friends to the north are going through.  I'm glad to see you reaching out too.   That's awesome!
text:It feels good to reach out and at least talk to someone about something to be honest. The seeker meets the supporter. The supporter has the support of the seeker.	labels:I know the feeling and especially in these times.  It seems things are looking up though with a vaccine coming soon.  Getting outside and reaching out is definitely the right thing to do.  Soon things will be back to normal!
text:That's what I'm hoping for... It looks like there is finally light at the end of the tunnel. The seeker feels happy and has a good time. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is good news.	labels:It's been a very long tunnel.  lol I can see the light!
text:Likewise! I appreciate you taking your time to talk to me. Thank you for making my day just a little bit better haha. The seeker is worried about not being able to live through a difficult life. The supporter could tell the seeker the best way to stay positive is to stay in the mindset of being someone who loves you.	labels:oh it's been my pleasure!!  Give the doggie a hug for me.
text:Haha I will do, take care and thank you for the chat! The seeker gets excited about his or her career. He or she thinks they have the opportunity to be some great people in their community.	labels:You're certainly welcome.  Take care of yourself!	episode_done:True
text:hi! how's your day going?\nHi there, I really need someone to talk to. My partner has been cheating on me and I feel totally worthless.. The seeker feels scared at the current situation. The supporter should help the seeker to understand the situation.	labels:oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that. when did you find out?
text:Only very recently. I answered his phone and it was her! When I confronted him he admitted it.. The seeker feels depressed and scared. The supporter could tell the seeker the reason he feels depressed is because he is not feeling well.	labels:that's a hard way to find out. are you still in the same house?
text:Yes because for financial reasons we have to be. Our relationship is really strained though and we are sleeping in separate bedrooms.. The seeker 's fear of losing his job is lifted. The seeker is still worried about this as well as his partner.	labels:i can't imagine what you are going through, but separate spaces sounds like a very good idea to me..
text:It is made worse by the fact that we are in lockdown and so can't really see other people at the moment. Do you think I should try and break away for good?. The seeker is in the middle of his morning break. The support is still watching him.	labels:before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options? you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?
text:Well, I could move out but I can't afford to rent a flat on my own. I'd have to move in with my parents, realistically.. I keep telling myself that but I feel really betrayed. I keep wondering what she is like and whether she is prettier and more successful than me.. The seeker feels sad. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay positive, but the seeker could also ask the seeker for help.	labels:are your parents supportive of that idea?.
text:I have not really talked to them about it. I feel a bit ashamed having to admit to them that my relationship has not worked out.. The seeker is worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:it's not about her or you. it's about him..
text:But I can't help thinking that perhaps I did something wrong that made him stray?. The seeker feels scared. The supporter could share the same experience, and suggest the seeker to stay negative.	labels:they will understand. opening up to them will be the hardest part. it's a shame cocktail, but it's not one you made.
text:Do you think that there is any point at all in trying to mend things at this stage? He has promised he will not see her again but I don't think I could ever trust him.. The seeker felt anxious and hurt for a few minutes. After a long silence, the seeker could let go of his thoughts and focus on the things he had missed.	labels:it's in our nature as women to ask "what did I do?" but it is never about us or anything we did..
text:Thank you, I am really glad that you understand. I don't feel that I will ever be able to trust any man again!. The seeker is confused and uncomfortable. The seeker should give a thought to how to deal with this situation.	labels:trust and vunerability is huge in a relationship. i'd look for professional help if you wan tot try and work on it.
text:I can't really afford professional help. And I don't want to be a burden on my friends. I worry that I am already annoying them.. The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could ask some questions.	labels:do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps.also, sharing your burden with someone does NOT add to their burden.
text:I do have a friend who has been through the same though ironically it is a male friend whose wife cheated on him!. The seeker feels frustrated and sad about the loss of his job. The supporter should take a hint from the seeker and explain what is going on.	labels:my guess is he felt the same way you are feeling right now.
text:Yes. It is just such a deep betrayal. I think I could have forgiven him if it had just been a one time mistake but he had been seeing her for ages.. The seeker feels scared about what he will do next. The supporter could tell the seeker he may have an issue with his wife but he is not sure. The supporter could also tell the seeker he does not want to give into the loneliness.	labels:watch the brene brown video on youtube with the cartoon animal about empathy - it should help when looking for friends to rely upon. grrrr. that would make me angry too.
text:It is nice to have things to distract myself from the things that are making me feel terrible. Do you have any other suggestions for distractions?. I just keep thinking that every evening when he was returning home with me and with every nice thing he said he was being false.. The seeker felt depressed. He could not concentrate and his attention was focused on his emotions and his job.	labels:i'm totally into the podcasts "a slob comes clean" basically it's about getting your poop in a group.
text:Hmm that sounds .. interesting :D. Is that a metaphor?. The seeker felt a lot of loneliness but was not sure what to do with it.	labels:that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!
text:I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship. The seeker can see that there are people around the place to try and break up with. I think he can relate to the fact that some people who have been on the receiving end of their emotional abuse and have had to cope with it as well.	labels:yes! LOL but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive.
text:Anything that will help me with my anxiety is worth trying at the moment.. The seeker feels scared and confused and he feels very sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that he could have died.	labels:what do you want to hear from her? is there anything she could say that woudl make you feel better? NO!! she's not going to be able to help you unless you need a witness for divorce court.
text:It would be less of a betrayal, I think, if she did not know about me. I would never do that to another woman!. The seeker felt depressed and worried over losing his job. The supporter could speak to her about how she needed her job to be fulfilled and what she will do about it.	labels:she likely knew, othewise how would he explain all the time he spent with you to her?
text:I suppose that's a good point too. I think maybe I do just need to make a total break and not look back.. I do appreciate you talking, you have helped me to see things a great deal more clearly than I previously did. The seeker felt frustrated. The supporter should ask for help and perhaps he should move on.	labels:glad i could help. please stay safe and no matter what you decide to do, you will be fine.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker is scared. The supporter could give more details.	labels:Hello how are you feeling today?
text:Well. Not so good i just broke up with my girlfriend and she is packing her stuff to leave. How are you doing? The seeker feels scared. But the support would help him to cope with it.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that. Breakups can be rough. I'm great! Thanks for asking. Was this a mutual agreement?
text:Well technically it was a mutual agreement but i feel like I dont want this to happen. So what are you up to? Hello? Are you there? The seeker tries to explain the issues of the relationship. The supporter could tell the seeker it is a problem for her because she has been a relationship killer for so long.	labels:Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.
text:Well. Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same.. She doesnt trust me. The seeker felt anxious and discouraged. He might think he has to be a better person. The seeker could also ask the supporter to tell him, as he is in need of help and help. It would be better to share some information with the seeker.	labels:I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with..
text:I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out. The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter should also share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.
text:We were together for two years. Im trying my best to go through this. I hope so. Thanks for all those words. It really helps. The seeker felt afraid of losing his job. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.
text:Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word. Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later. The seeker is sad because they have been together for two years. They think there might be a problem. Seeker: I don't know what to say to her.	labels:Absolutely! You have an amazing day and keep you head up!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there, would you be able to give me some advice?. The first lockdown was bad enough but the second has really thrown me into despair. I simply cannot cope without being able to see friends and family for much longer. The seeker feels anxious. He could tell he is afraid and anxious.	labels:I would be glad to. What is troubling you?
text:I have run out of coping mechanisms! The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experiences and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I completely understand and had similar experiences. What were some ways you tried to interact with people last shut down?
text:I use facebook quite a lot and it helps but it cannot compensate for face to face contact. I really need to be able to see people.. The seeker is worried that he is breaking up with his boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around him to make him feel at ease.	labels:Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?
text:Well, part of the problem with that is that I am not sure what the rules are any more! We have been told so many different things that I am out of the loop.. The seeker feels scared of losing his job and he would love to be able to contact people in the future but it is such an unrealistic expectation that he cannot.	labels:I understand. Try sticking to the basics to make it less stressful. Wear a mask outside at a distance..
text:I always do wear a mask.. I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again.. The seeker feels anxious about losing her job. The supporter could tell the seeker about the situation. Even though she was told about the situation last time, she still can't believe it.	labels:Have to talked about this with friends? They may be feeling the same way. Just talking this out with the may be reassuring..
text:I have a little bit but I don't want to burden them. The other aspect is that it is making me anxious about many others things too. I keep having morbid thoughts about what will happen if the pandemic never ends.. The seeker feels anxious to know what is going on, and the seeker can help to help.	labels:That’s understandable. Maybe talking to a professional who you don’t have to worry about burdening with your concerns will  allow you to talk about your concerns..
text:That's why I'm here ;). You are being very helpful, thank you! It's just nice to be able to tell people what I am worried about and not have them think that I am just being silly. The seeker feels scared and unsure about his or her identity anymore. The supporter could tell the seeker the feeling of being alone and scared is not as dangerous as it used to be.	labels:Many people are struggling with the current state of affairs. Don’t be afraid to talk to people they may also be afraid to talk to people and you could miss out on supporting each other..
text:That does sound like really good advice. The other thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I have been having financial pressures because I am on furlough. I am worried that if this lasts much longer I will end up deep in debt. The seeker felt anxious and worried over the loss of his job. The supporter can also share some similar experience and suggestions for the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:I am sorry that wasn’t helpful.. Have you tried looking into local recourses in your city?
text:I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched.. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is about anxiety, lack of focus, lack of self-esteem etc..	labels:That is true it has been hard for many people..
text:I do feel better for having been able to talk to you about this - thank you very much!. I think I will be able to carry on for a bit now. Thanks again and best wishes! The seeker felt depressed and lonely.	labels:I’m glad I could provide you some support.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, is there anything you would like to talk about today? Take your time I will be right here.\nJust can not seem to get out of this funk. The seeker feels a sense of rest and peace. He can talk about being happy, happy and still feel happy.	labels:What kind of a funk is it? Do you have to go to work or school? Please tell me more about how you are feeling so I can understand better.
text:Nothing seems to be fun and I work from home. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is not fun to be alone. However, the seeker might not care about their job.	labels:Are you doing okay workwise, getting enough done, getting it done on time? Or is it difficult to get motivated about anything? Is there anything that you think started making you feel this way? I am very interested in understanding how you feel.
text:I think this whole Covid thing has been depressing! I get my work done but it is a chore. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip..
text:I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out.. The seeker feels excited about the new job. The supporter can tell the seeker to not take any chances and to not take chances.	labels:I am glad you are able to work, financial stress really sucks. I think Covid has us all down at least at some point..
text:Just want it to be over and then the election too! There has been so much emotional things in the world going on right now. BLM, election Covid... The seeker felt depressed, but the supporter could help the seeker cope.	labels:Yes, and it doesn't seem to have an end in sight. But at some point it will be over. If you don't feel more like yourself say a month from now I have to seeing a doctor because some depression requires it but that said some depression is normal and usually precedes change. I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way..
text:I would say when i take a walk at the park it does help. Also working out. So exercise and sunshine brings my mood up a bit. The seeker feels anxious about getting married. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is pregnant.	labels:You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.
text:good advice. I will try. The seeker was scared about losing his job. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?
text:Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude. The seeker felt stressed and worried because of the news from Nashville. They can explain that it is Christmas in Nashville, so they need to be out by Christmas.	labels:Positive attitudes are never bad, slightly annoying to some first thing in the morning but in a good way. lol.
text:Yes, I need coffee first! Thank you for your advice! The seeker feels anxious. The supporter did not say anything and was trying to explain.	labels:Coffee sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for sharing!
text:Happy Thanksgiving:) The seeker felt very stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker is stressed and worried about losing his job. The supporter should also ask for more details.	labels:Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels depressed and doesn't like to be alone.	labels:Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?
text:I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it. The seeker feels anxious about not being able to go out with his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has a problem with her.	labels:Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through..
text:Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. The seeker feels stressed and worried about doing something about his problem. The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is his wife's cheating.	labels:I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
text:What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? The seeker was in the bathroom at the toilet and was suddenly startled by a voice. The seeker answered the voice with a question.	labels:Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.
text:I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
text:I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. The seeker feels anxious about the possibility that the meeting will end. The organizer is not aware of what she's talking about and is not sure about her motivation. Maybe her goal is to stop being so worried about the meeting? The organizer's goal is to make sure that the day is over and the meeting is over.	labels:Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
text:That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way! The seeker hopes that she will find love and help her with the situation. The supporter can also share some negative experiences of the situation by asking her to help the seeker in their situation. She can also discuss how she's feeling and how she's feeling about the situation and they can help each other.	labels:Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
text:very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? The seeker is so worried about the situation, she doesn't look for help. The supporter could explain the situation and explain what the problem is.	labels:Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
text:not at all. I appreciate your candour. The seeker is worried about a life outside of marriage. The sponsor should explain the issue. The supporter should also tell the seeker that they need to talk to their spouse at least once to talk about it.	labels:But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
text:All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. The seeker feels nervous about her life. The supporter could tell the seeker that she doesn't want to live happily ever after, as she has not been having any family or friends. They should keep this in mind as they will not be able to take care of the child and the child's family.	labels:I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you feeling today?.\nHello. I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible? The seeker feels depressed. It has a long day and this is a long day. This is the reason why I am so stressed. I'm not happy but I'm still worried about this.	labels:Of course! What sort of issue is it?.
text:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could help him in some way.	labels:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?.
text:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! The seeker feels lonely. The supporter would like to know how to fix it. The seeker should also share the experience of his work.	labels:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?.
text:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament? The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!.
text:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one. The seeker felt very depressed but at the same time she felt that she had been left behind.	labels:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that..
text:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser. The seeker was scared about the loss of his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is with the old job but the seeker would be afraid of losing his job.	labels:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing..
text:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal? The seeker feels worried and worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker the future is going to be bad for them, but he still has his job at hand.	labels:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?.
text:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years. The seeker feels anxious about a job offer. The supporter could tell the seeker that they were only interested in the skills required to find a job and the person has no qualifications for that job. The supporter could tell the seeker that they do not have any experience in a field where they are not employed. The supporter could tell the seeker that a job offer makes them feel uncomfortable, and that it is very sad to	labels:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?.
text:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-) The seeker feels relieved by the news from Nashville. The supporter is happy to hear that the news is good and happy with the job as well.	labels:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!.
text:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things. The seeker would like to learn a lot from his experiences. What did his life have to offer him? He would like to learn from his experiences. What would he have done differently? He may not have been successful but he was an excellent person.	labels:No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!.
text:Yes true thanks for your understanding. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.
text:You have indeed, thanks for this conversation. The seeker is concerned about his or her future. The seeker could tell the seeker that he or she has a life, that it is not worth it.	labels:Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!.
text:Will do, thanks again! The seeker feels happy and happy. He has now found a job and is now happy with the job he is doing. The seeker feels happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy and happy	labels:Erm .. cup of coffee?.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon how may I help you today?\nHello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why. The seeker felt depressed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
text:No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker who is scared is the one who loses his job. This could be any of the following:	labels:These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
text:I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. The seeker feels paranoid about being in the house. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is a threat to his life.	labels:Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?.
text:Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker about his job situation.	labels:It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
text:What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. The seeker felt so alone. The support group wasn't an option. The support group doesn't help.	labels:Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app..
text:I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. The seeker felt depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she could have an important role for her. The seeker could also ask the seeker for more information.	labels:There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
text:I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? The seeker was worried about finding a therapist. The supporter could tell the seeker the therapist is available.	labels:After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it..
text:That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. The seeker feels very sad, and is in great pain. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is in need of help and that she needs to feel better.	labels:It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that..
text:I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. The seeker is worried about her loss of her job. The supporter could tell the seeker that if they keep their job they will lose their job. The seeker could tell the seeker that they are not good enough so they need to leave.	labels:I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
text:Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. The seeker felt sad and sad. The supporter should be able to answer a few questions. She should also ask about her boyfriend. She should also tell her story. She should be able to explain what she wanted to be with her boyfriend. She should also have a very clear vision of what she wants to be.	labels:I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. What would you like to discuss today?\nHi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried I. I'm next. The seeker feels anxiety about finding work. The supporter can tell the seeker that there is something going on with him and that he needs a job so they can move on.	labels:My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?
text:Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. The seeker felt anxious that he didn't get a job in his lifetime.	labels:So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?
text:Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?
text:No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now. The seeker feels anxious about his job. The supporter could tell him that his career is in danger. The seeker could tell the seeker that his career is in danger.	labels:Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.
text:Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments.
text:I'm an owner. What kind of programs? The seeker feels that they are living in a better situation. The supporter could help the seeker feel more comfortable about living in a better place.	labels:Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it.
text:oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion. The seeker feels hopeless because he has no idea. He doesn't have the skills in the field and he can't figure out how to deal with people.	labels:I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
text:yeah how can I make more money on the side? it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good. The seeker is being asked questions such as "What is the worst situation for you?" "What is the worst situation for the country?"<|endoftext|>	labels:As there are a lot of people who've lost their jobs the pickins' are quite slim. But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.
text:oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays! The seeker is happy as possible. I appreciate the support and hope you get some help and help with all the other tasks. I need a job for a few months, this is where I work. I need some help with some things. I need some money.	labels:If it's in your area Instacart is also hiring shoppers and delivery drivers. Is that something you might be able to do?	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing today?\nHi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone. The seeker does not feel like he is being asked to do anything.	labels:I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
text:I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the feelings can be overwhelming.	labels:There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
text:I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? The seeker feels pressured to ask for more information about their situation. The supporter does not want anyone to know the truth and the seeker does not want to disappoint anyone.	labels:It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
text:I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments.. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. The seeker feels stressed about not being able to get his job back. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggestion that he or she can get a job back and do the basics.	labels:I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
text:What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The sponsor could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
text:I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. The seeker feels scared about being in the same situation as he is. The supporter could tell the seeker that he should focus on his goal and not worrying about it.	labels:How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
text:That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? The seeker is scared. The supporter could tell the seeker the person is afraid of losing her job. They could tell the seeker that they are scared of losing their job and the seeker could talk about the fear.	labels:Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
text:Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now. The seeker feels afraid of letting go of his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has to cut off his life. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Great! I hope for the best for you!	episode_done:True
text:hi how's it going today?\nHello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. The seeker feels sad and depressed. The supporter could add support and offer some advice.	labels:i hear you. it has been a hard year. what's been the biggest challenge for you?
text:Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over.. The seeker tries to find a way to find happiness. The supporter could explain to the seeker that the situation is unbearable for him and the seeker will find a solution.	labels:it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future?
text:Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. The seeker is scared about losing his job. The supporter could share another experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:it's true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?
text:Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could share details about his experience on how he is coping, and suggested to the seeker to stay positive.	labels:it is like there's a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.
text:How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? The seeker feels scared about his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the other person is taking his job seriously. The seeker could also tell the seeker that if he is in the position of being a good friend or a strong friend to the other person, he will always be the friend he always will be.	labels:the "little black rain cloud" people? LOLI try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it's our first.
text:Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could also share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s.
text:I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. The seeker feels more stressed. The supporter should also think about their own fears.	labels:The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012.
text:I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. The seeker was in a room with a nice supporter. The supporter said he knew about the new year and had a chance to look into his future. The seeker said he would try to see if his life would end at any point this year.	labels:are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?
text:No but I did love that show as a kid. The seeker felt scared. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are dealing with a problem.	labels:Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren't always helpful. anyone in particular for you?
text:My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things. The seeker is worried that he is being watched. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.
text:Yes. I also don't feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. The seeker felt depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the things are really bad and the reason for that is because people are scared and afraid.	labels:oooh, that's hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways.
text:No but near him and take care of him. The seeker is scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:that's really nice of you. i'm 800+ miles away from my parents.
text:That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. The seeker feels like she is experiencing a traumatic event. The supporter could tell the seeker the event of their life will come back to haunt them.	labels:if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy.
text:Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help. The seeker feels sad.	labels:those help me focus on how hard it is for everyone around me and that i should be kinder to them. everyone has their own crap.
text:Indeed. it helps to have people to talk to right? The seeker is looking for someone to help him or her. The supporter could tell the seeker that he or she needs help.	labels:true. stay safe.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. How are you feeling today?\nHi, I'm feeling really anxious today. The seeker feels anxious, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:What has made you feel anxious?
text:Yesterday my company laid off 10% of the workforce and another 10% got furloughed. I'm afraid I might be in the next round. The seeker feels afraid about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that. I am currently in a situation where furloughs are greatly affecting my family as well.
text:Oh no that's terrible. The problem is, I am right now the only breadwinner in the family. My wife was laid off three months ago. The seeker feels afraid about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he could lose that job.	labels:Are you given specifics on time of furlough?
text:No, it's basically until things get better. The seeker is worried, but the supporter could tell the seeker the issue is not due to job loss. After all, if you find yourself being laid off, your family will be sad.	labels:I know that's very difficult. And no doubt why you're here working for crumbs. It's why I'm here as well.
text:Yeah, trying to make ends meet wherever I can. I've been also trying to do uber as well but everyone is doing it also. The seeker does not feel as scared as he did last night. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not as scared as he was last night. The seeker can also tell the seeker that he will feel better over the next few days.	labels:I know it's a difficult time. Yes Uber is definitely overrun right now. Have you taken any time out to address your anxiety so it doesn't become more serious?.
text:I don't know what I can do. I've been trying to keep busy. And I can't afford a therapist or anything like that. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Yes, that's definitely an expense you can't afford right now. But are you familiar with the concept of controlled breathing to help reduce or relieve anxiety?
text:Like meditation? What am I supposed to do? Just breathe in and out a lot? The seeker feels scared of becoming an Uber driver. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Not exactly. Controlled breathing is more of getting yourself into a quiet room. Closing your eyes, and purposely and intently focusing on your breathing. Slowly breathe in for a count of 5, then slowly exhale for a count of 5. Repeat this process for approximately 10 minute. It will help your stress levels and help regulate your heart rate!
text:Oh I didn't know that. No, I haven't tried that. Does it really work? The seeker does a slow breathing, then slowly gets back into quiet mode.	labels:I've been using it myself over the past 3 months and it most definitely helps! But it's absolutely imperative to clear your mind and have complete quiet.
text:ok I can try it I guess. thanks for that tip. The seeker feels very relaxed. The supporter could tell the seeker that his job could be a life of happiness. The seeker could also ask for advice on how to deal with stress.	labels:No problem. I hope this gives you some relief! Stay strong!
text:yeah, thanks. same to you. The seeker feels nervous about getting a job. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is serious. The seeker must be able to handle all kinds of work and he shouldn't be worried about being laid off.	labels:My final piece of advice would be to set aside time that is specified where nothing negative is discussed. No politics, no bills, nothing anxiety producing for you. It's probably best if this time is within an hour of your bedtime becuase anxiety is not conducive to a good night's sleep.
text:That's helpful. Thanks. The seeker feels stressed and worried about being called out. The seeker could tell the seeker the anxiety is not from the event, but the person has been called out.	labels:No problem. Take care. Wishing you well on your situation.	episode_done:True
text:hi.\nOnline learning is not seems easy, Seems I am going to fail this year. The seeker feels anxious about this. The supporter could tell the seeker the fear of losing his job is probably related to his depression and anxiety.	labels:chill my dear friend, nothing of that sort will happen.
text:In-class learning was way better and I learned a lot but now its so confusing. The seeker feels a lot of frustration with his loss of job. The supporter could tell the seeker is feeling frustrated and she should take care of her own.	labels:everything you need is a little peace of mind, patience and little more effort.
text:Even working with online tools is hard. The seeker feels anxious and scared about breaking up with his boyfriend. The supporter should ask the seeker to stay on their online learning path.	labels:i understand, but just think everyone else like us are doing the same and facing the same difficulties.

text:Thank you for the encouragement. The seeker as worried about what to say to the supporters. The supporters should say it was not in their best interest.	labels:You are very welcome.  Is there anything else I can help you with?	episode_done:True
text:How can I help you today?\nHi there. I'm seeking some support, maybe some advice in dealing with a situation at my work. I've got a new supervisor who is so different from my last one. The seeker feels scared to leave his job and his life. The supporter could tell the seeker that he will be left to make a choice that will help him.	labels:Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one. What kinds of things are troubling to you?
text:Yes. They have a Military background and bark orders, and change the way I'm working without being open to conversation. When I ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they "Don't have to explain themselves!" as they are my supervisor. The seeker feels scared of losing his job and feeling like he is taking away his opportunity. The supporter could tell the seeker that the candidate has to be a good supervisor and not be a burden.	labels:Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant.  Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?
text:Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also Military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great.. But my other co-worker is like me. Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to.. Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived. The seeker felt scared about being forced to leave his job because of the military background and it was easy for him to leave. He could say he would be more helpful to a co-worker or a co-worker since they are so different, but he was already on his own.	labels:That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.
text:Yea. But when he threatens and calls my insubordinate, I worry he might be making a case to remove me. I wonder if I should talk to the person above him, about it. But I worry they might just think I'm complaining because its different. But it really is uncomfortable. The seeker can tell the seeker what they need to do and what to do, which is to get a job. In this conversation, the seeker is about to be laid off from his job and his friends.	labels:It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you.  Talking to someone above your supervisor may be a good solution. .
text:Its been 3 months since he started, I just wonder if its too soon. I'd hate to be seen as a complainer. And the person above him, is the person who hired him. The seeker is afraid that the situation is too serious. The seeker could tell the seeker to ask for more information or to ask the support for helping him.	labels:When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.
text:Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people? The seeker feels worried about being laid off. He needs someone to get him back on track.	labels:I see you really like your job.  Sometimes just taking a deep breath can help to calm stress. .
text:Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress. I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed? The seeker feels more relaxed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Do you think he'll be receptive to your communications if you speak directly to him?
text:I think its worth a try, but I don't want him to think I'm being argumentative. Any suggestions on how to have that conversation? The seeker feels intimidated by his new job. He can tell he is starting to feel discouraged and can point to his social media accounts and ask for advice. This is the same experience he had before his first job interview, but he felt he could never really trust a person like him.	labels:I can see that you worry about your boss seeing you as argumentative, but could you try it from the perspective of making your boss feel like he is in control?
text:Making it his idea. That's a good tactic. I could try that. And maybe giving him time to understand the workplace as it new to him too. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:I think you've given me some good advice. Thank you. I feel a little less anxious than I did. The seeker elt a lot of anxiety. He is not the only person worried.

text:Yes,it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID.. They have been going to temp services also.. The seeker would like to share some details for the supporter to understand.	labels:I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on.

They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it's hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job?
text:No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. The seeker feels nervous about his or her job. He could find a way to help his family, but it will be difficult.	labels:This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid. You should be happy that you have them.
text:I'm so sorry. I feel a little better talking about this. My family tries to help other family members but we can only do so much. That's when I got frustrated (helping them with unemployment) The seeker feels overwhelmed by his situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is his situation but that he will need help from the other family members.	labels:Money is not always a big deal honey.
text:Yes, there is more to life than money. Unfortunately $ is needed for the basics.. Thanks for listening and guidance. The seeker feels a little lonely. The seeker wants to get better. But she feels lonely. She feels lonely. This is the same thing that she is feeling.	labels:Of course but having them by your side is a gift. your welcome. I wish I could help a little.
text:Yes and I wish you a good thanksgiving holiday.. The seeker felt thankful for having the people around him. He felt relieved to return to work, but felt a little lonely. He felt lonely and lonely. At some point he was going to find someone else to help him.	labels:You too.	episode_done:True
text:I am very upset. The seeker feels stressed and feels so lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker the stress is caused by the person who isn't here.	labels:Hello, how are you doing today? Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?
text:A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday. The seeker feels very stressed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?
text:Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has had so much of a bad day and the support of her family.	labels:That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?
text:I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong. The seeker feels more depressed and confused. The supporter would tell the seeker that he may be losing his job because of the depression. The seeker could tell the seeker that he is going to lose his job because of the depression.	labels:Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?.
text:No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship. The seeker feels afraid to take responsibility for herself. As long as she is not abusing anyone, she is okay with taking responsibility for her own well-being.	labels:Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?
text:Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore. The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.
text:That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now. The seeker feels like he feels insecure. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not alone. They could tell that they have a problem with each other and the seeker feels a little bad for losing his job as well.	labels:Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nHello, I'm feeling very anxious about my classes. How are you? The seeker feels anxious, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful.
text:Yeah, especially with the pandemic, it's just been so hard to try and focus. The seeker feels anxious about his job and needs help. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not able to focus on activities as much as he needs to.	labels:I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this.
text:Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far. The seeker feels relieved and happy. He is more confident and has a more positive outlook.	labels:Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.
text:I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? The seeker is worried about being left out in the cold and that he or she needs to be able to help others. The supporter could ask for other ideas to help people make the most of the time they have with their friends.	labels:Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.
text:I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class. The seeker feels anxious about his work. The supporter should help him out by saying that he has been working hard, but that he needs help.	labels:I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)
text:I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? The seeker feels scared and frustrated. He needs his job back and is afraid to go back to work for fear that they will need to use his job again.	labels:That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.
text:Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. The seeker may be scared of losing his job. The supporter can share some similar experiences and ask for ways for the seeker to get a better job.	labels:What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.
text:I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. The seeker feels sad about his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has to do this job to get his dream job and that is not the case. It will not get to him.	labels:That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.
text:Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot. The seeker feels depressed and is worried about missing all of his school classes. The supporter could help to make his school better by giving an explanation for why he feels that way and what he could do to change it.	labels:I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!	episode_done:True

The supporter could tell the seeker how to cope with the loss of his job.	labels:You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her.
text:but think about her mom how could i handle her. The seeker worried but still wants to be with her. The person's feeling is a lot like that of a woman.	labels:Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.
text:yes im going to warn her. The seeker angry and scared. Seeker should be careful what he says.	labels:You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish.
text:yeah i can understand. The seeker scared about losing her job. The supporter should ask the seeker if she feels sorry for her.	labels:And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake , so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy :)
text:sure i will try to solve my problem. The seeker nsecure about his own sexual relationship with her mom. The seeker could tell the seeker that she is a victim and the support group will help him to find a solution.	labels:Thats the spirit :)
text:give any tips to warn her my friend. The seeker uneasy about cheating. The seeker should help the seeker to find any suitable means to resolve his problems.	labels:Just be bold enough, dont get aroused or attracted to her by any way even though she's seducing you, be harsh towards her , because you will have to teach a better lesson to her. Tell her, if she repeats this , then you are either gonna tell it to your girlfriend or either file a complaint against her.
text:yyeah sure my friend i will try this. The seeker s scared and worried about the situation. The supporting agent should do simple things like make sure the support is ready for the seeker.	labels:Yess. Go ahead.	episode_done:True
text:I am worried about being perfect on my job.  I don't want to lose my job. The seeker says there is more to life than meets the eye. He then gets a message from a friend and asks if he could help him with his work. The seeker can say yes.	labels:I hear you are trying to be perfect on your job because you are worried about losing your job.  How long have you been at your job?
text:I have been working for about 4 months, but I just am not as fast at it as everyone else.  I'm trying so hard working late and everything but it's never enough. The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker should talk to the support and ask for help.	labels:That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best.  Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?
text:Maybe I could ask my friend and co-worker for some tips.  I'm a little embarrassed to do so, but don't know where to turn. I don't want to get fired. The seeker experiences many feelings of anxiety.	labels:Asking for help isn't always a bad thing.  I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out.  I was so relieved.
text:That's true maybe it could turn out for the better.  But what if they see me as incompetant? The seeker was worried about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the he is worried about losing his job.	labels:I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.
text:That's a good way to put it. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter should share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.
text:I will have to try that.  That might help. The seeker felt confident that the support would be positive. It was surprising to hear that the support was positive.	labels:Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings?  Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.
text:That sounds great.  Do you think my work would be supportive? The seeker felt really depressed about being depressed. The supporter could ask for a short time to ask for more information.	labels:Work can often pay for trainings or offer suggestions what may improve work strategies.
text:Wow, I hope I can take advantage of that.  I will have to check into that.  Who should I approach at work? The seeker felt that he is over the hill. He would like to know if he can help or not. The seeker is asked if he would like to help.	labels:You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes Human resources for support.
text:I can do that.  I think I'll reach out tomorrow to Human Resources for some help. The seeker feels really depressed about his job and his family. In this conversation, the seeker may mention loneliness, depression and other issues in his life.	labels:That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support.  Is there anything else I can help with?
text:No that should be all.  I am feeling more confident in strategies to use to help me.  Thanks. The seeker feels afraid for his life. The seeker asks questions. The seeker could not answer them.	labels:You are very welcome.	episode_done:True
text:Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don't think I can ever be happy again. The seeker feels sad for his partner. The supporter could tell the seeker the feeling of betrayal was happening to him, the support would ask for more details.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self-esteem is that true?
text:I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work. The seeker felt very anxious about what he was going to do next. The supporter could tell the seeker that the next step is to have a relationship with the person he loves.	labels:do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?
text:Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. The seeker is worried about not being able to be happy. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her who are trying to make her feel happy but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.
text:I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. The seeker is feeling lonely. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.
text:I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't  ever want to feel like this again. The seeker feels the need to try to make an apology to his ex. The supporter could give some explanation for why he felt that way.	labels:relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves.

The seeker believes he has been through a difficult time. The supporter could tell the seeker the other person has been through a similar experience, and also that this person has been through similar experiences.	labels:Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?
text:I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have  a good cry but I almost couldn't stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support. The seeker feels depressed about not having found a new job. The supporter could tell the seeker the person in the contact with the person in the contact with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the person with the	labels:Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.
text:Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take? The seeker felt depressed and scared. The supporter should ask for details.	labels:When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.
text:I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere. The seeker feels worried about breaking up with his boyfriend and his ex is very sad.

text:I don't think I'd want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. The seeker feels depressed about that. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?
text:I've never heard of friendship apps to be honest. The seeker feels extremely isolated. He can't come to a decision to join a group. The seeker feels isolated because he can't come to a decision about what to say and what to say. The seeker is frustrated and needs help making his decision.	labels:Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don't want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it's more than just feeling like you don't have any friends?
text:I'd really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by.
text:I don't know if it's more than that. What do you mean? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people. The seeker felt as though a lot of strangers around her don't know who she is. She needs someone who knows her name. She needs someone who knows her face.	labels:Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.
text:oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person? The seeker feels like he has no friends and feels lonely. The supporter could explain the reasoning behind the fear and how to keep positive feelings to yourself.	labels:Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout :)

text:Yes, I suppose you are right. My aunt is the youngest sister of my mom. We used to see each other at family gatherings. Maybe she won't mind me calling.. The seeker feels anxious. He can tell that the seeker doesn't have the help in place but he will still be able to feel like he is strong.	labels:see you got this, a call is all that it takes to feel better.

text:You have a good point there. I used to think if I had my family then I didn't need anybody else. But we all need somebody to talk to. The seeker felt lonely. The supporter could also tell the seeker that he has to keep on working. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is alone, but the seeker would not know.	labels:exactly you got it, we all need to surround ourselves with good people, im glad that you realize this. I hope that my insight has given you motavation to pursue relationships.
text:Thanks for your help. I'll go now and get my thoughts together to call my aunt. The seeker tries to feel safe and secure, yet he is afraid of being alone.

text:That's true. everything just feels so out of control. The seeker feels stressed and worried about getting out of his job. The supporter could tell the seeker about his job.	labels:When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease. Maybe you can focus on setting up quarantine room, or getting medication and food to last for those weeks just in case. Worst case out of that is that you have some extra food and medicine..
text:i can focus on the things i can control - that's good advice. what have you been doing to stay sane through all of this? The seeker feels afraid of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Well for one my house has never been so spotless ha. I have been exercising more, going for more walks with my dog, having more family nights, just anything really that can take my mind of it.
text:i haven't felt like doing much of anything, my house is wreck. where are you finding motivation. The seeker felt like he is in control. He thought that he is going to be depressed for a long time. He found this to be so good that when he did go to his doctor he said he would have to be on meds for a while. He wanted to focus on the things he could control, but he did not feel that he was going to be depressed for long.	labels:I did not want to let my fears control me. Believe me the first month or so i did just that. I just wanted to feel better. I started small, cleaning one room at a time. Making a small list to get done. Sooner than later the lists got longer, the place got cleaner.
text:did you find a list online or make it yourself? The seeker does not feel it was a list or a piece of paper but rather a list of things he felt would be important to him. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:I made one starting with the easiest jobs first.
text:what should i do when i finish cleaning? The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are going through a difficult time. The seeker could ask for help with the job.	labels:Have you ever wanted to try a new hobby? Knitting, woodworking, anything really?

The seeker felt isolated and isolated.	labels:I was checking 10 times a day. What really helped me was to actually stop checking. Maybe just try to get some local news but dont let it consume you.
text:cleaning, hobbies, anything else good for distraction? got a good podcast recommendation? The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is a problem of focus and focus. The seeker can help the seeker focus.	labels:Ha not at the moment no. I think also trying to include the family in those things as well really helps. I mean if things get heated always good to give everyone space. Well i do love last house on the left, but that is a little dark and i think were trying to steer away from that.
text:thanks for your advice. y'all stay safe. The seeker felt scared. The supporter could also share some similar experiences and suggestions to help them stay calm.	labels:I hope you do too and i hope the results come out in your favor! If not stay strong and prepared!	episode_done:True

The seeker felt depressed and depressed.	labels:Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available..
text:I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. The seeker fears that his job could be gone. The supporter could tell the seeker that he feels he will be unable to continue living.	labels:I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives..
text:I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town . like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual  city is 45 miles away. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker could tell the seeker that he has lost his job because of the loss of his job.	labels:Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city?.

Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
text:Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. The seeker elt worried about being out of a job and not getting a job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the reason why they are out of a job is they are not willing to work.	labels:I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I'm sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all.
text:yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas. The seeker feels relieved.

We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but I believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around! Well, I hope I have encouraged you..
text:Yes, I think walking, changing my thoughts, praying, and taking care of myself will really help. Yes! You've really helped me out. I just turned 64 and my husband is 69. He is really, really healthy because he takes care of himself so well.. He has a handicapped younger sister and he always wanted to be around to take care of her. So he has always taken care of himself! Thanks so much! The seeker feels anxious, worried, scared and worried about the loss of his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss is going to happen to him.	labels:So we are about the same age then!

I suggest making a plan of action, trying to pay at least the minimal balance, and try work out a saving plan to pay it off..
text:Yes I realize that but I have no job. I have minimal balance in a week of 100. The seeker elt worried about not getting paid. The sponsor could tell the seeker to buy groceries or buy food that she needs.	labels:Okay, can you reduce any expenses? Maybe a subscription?
text:I don't have a job and husband pays all the bills and subscriptions.  We live paycheck to paycheck and he said this is my fault i pay. this would be fine if i had an income and had money that i could do that but I told you before I don't have a job so that doesn't help me. The seeker elt anxious and stressed about not paying bills to pay off the debt he has been accumulating. He could tell the seeker that the amount he owes is due. If he is paying off the debt, he could say "I'm not paying off my debt" to say that the debt is due. If he is not paying off the debt, he could say "I'm not paying off my debt"	labels:If you have more free time, you can spend it on Amazon Mturk? It is a good way to earn extra money.

I think we have little in common these days and I don't feel the same way I used to. I don;t want to hurt her feelings but I'm thinking about ending the relationship. The seeker felt afraid that she would be fired. The supporter should ask for more details on the situation and the reasons behind that.	labels:Have you been feeling this way for a while or is it a surprise change?
text:I have felt like this for a while now but I'm thinking about if more nowadays. It doesn't feel right and I don't know who to handle it. The seeker feels scared for the future.

The seeker feels scared and anxious about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the same situation.	labels:I can tell that you are a nice person that cares for your girlfriend and you want the best for her. I think you want to be honest with her which is a good sign of maturity and integrity.
text:Thanks for that. I do care for her which is why I don't want to upset her. The seeker needs to find a way to get a relationship that is loving and satisfying.	labels:Unfortunately this may be upsetting in the short term. I had a friend who had a similar issue. He wanted to end things with his girlfriend and they ended up having an honest conversation, which was upsetting at the time but they are still friends to this day and parted on good terms.
text:It is good that it is possible to do this and still become friends afterwards. I do worry about how this would go and am fearful that she will react badly. How would you go about it? The seeker is worried about the loss of his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I think the best thing to do would just be honest about your feelings and start the conversation with her. I think you could also consider when is the right time to do this so that you minimise the affect that this may have on her.
text:I'm not sure what you mean by the right time. Is there ever a right time to do this? The seeker feels worried about the lack of happiness in their relationship. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:People who have a negative experience at a key point in their lives, such as a birthday of Christmas, tend to remember that bad experience the following year. I mean choose an appropriate time to have the discussion.
text:Ok I get it. Don't dump her on her birthday LOL. So I should just start the talk then, may be one evening? The seeker feels anxious about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker the future is coming very soon.	labels:Yes when she is available to have a good talk about this. Do you have my friends that you can talk to about this?
text:I do have some friends that know how I am feeling yes. Maybe they can help me come up with a plan off what to say. The seeker feels very upset. The supporter may be able to show some support but I don't think this is the right thing to do.	labels:I think it's best to be honest and if it comes from the heart then you can at least say you have been honest with yourself and your girlfriend.
text:I think this is going to be hard but thanks for the suggestions. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I think you can do this and have confidence that you will do it in the right way. These things are not easy but I know you can ride to the challenge and do this tactfully and with care.

text:They are swamped with their own bills and we live pay check to pay check. The seeker is worried about his job and his family. The supporter could help, but the seeker needs to find ways to support.	labels:Have you tried contacting the credit card company and explaining your situation?
text:No I haven't but if i don't pay minimum I will get 24% interest penalty. The seeker had the option of contacting a credit card company. They are more reluctant to contact a credit card company because they fear if they don't get the payment they will be charged.	labels:that seems excessive. I had a similar situation happened myself once and what I did was transfer the balance of one of my cards onto another.
text:It is the truth thats why I try to pay off in full but there was such a great deal. but thats a great idea and would give me a little extra time. Thank you . I think Ill go google credit card offers. The seeker elt depressed and worried about closing his credit card account. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss of his job is all coming down to the negative feeling of losing his job.	labels:do you think the credit card company has acted irresponsibly?
text:no I knew the terms when I signed up a year ago. The seeker feels scared.	labels:even so you may be able to refer this situation for review to a financial regulator.
text:I like your idea of transferring to lower interest one. The seeker feels stressed and scared. The supporter can tell the seeker the problem is not in the credit card company.	labels:You can review your rights online as a consumer to see if you are offered any protection under law or legislation.

text:My co-workers feel that this whole pandemic thing is a government conspiracy to lessen the overpopulation in this world. It really hurts me cause I have people who have passed due to this. THIS IS REAL!! The seeker feels frustrated. The supporter can tell the seeker the situation is getting worse and worse.	labels:There are a lot of people who are struggling and it is clearly a very upsetting time for you.. Have you considered whether your colleagues are simply hiding their worry? Have you tried talking to them?
text:Yet it is upsetting and I worry for them. The seeker feels stressed. He feels depressed because he has to stay home with his wife and kids and his wife is with someone he can't find.	labels:That is extremely compassionate of you..

Now I respect their positions in life, but since we work together, we have to protect other feelings as well.. The seeker feels scared to leave his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggested the seeker to stay positive.	labels:There is a lot of concern about, are your work following guidelines?

The supporter could tell the seeker that he is making a difficult decision.	labels:I am also in this situation at work, I have used breathing methods to calm myself down which worked, have you tried anything like this?
text:It is simple, put on mask and work, when you get out of the office then do what you want. I am anxious now and using a breathing exercise as I type. The seeker felt happy. The supporter could tell the seeker that they should be more relaxed and relaxed. The seeker could then tell the seeker that he is not working with them anymore. This will help to explain why the seeker has been in this situation for so long.	labels:So you are frustrated because others are not using masks, have I got that right?
text:It's not that they are not using masks, it is their position and reasons not to wear the masks and that puts others in a scary and anxious position at their workplace where in these times, work is scare. What is your point of view on masks? The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could also share examples and ask for help from other people.	labels:Just from talking to you, I can feel how anxious you are and this is made worse by your colleagues, perhaps they are struggling in different ways with this.
text:Yes they are....we need to make things different for everyone in the workplace but not on peoples health. The seeker feels sad about the loss of his job. The supporter could share some similar experiences and suggestions.	labels:There are guidelines on how work places should be handling the COVID issue. Has your manager gone through any guidelines with the team?
text:Yes he has and is going to go over it on Monday with all of us and we should come to an agreement. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:That seems like a really good time to go through how you feel. Writing how you feel down can help to ensure that you get your feelings across. Do you think that is something you could do?
text:Yes, this is something I can do. You have been a great help listening to my issues. The seeker feels anxious about losing her job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggestion the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:I am glad this is something that can work for you, it is something that could help in different ways..

text:same here, now how do you get out of this.... The seeker feels anxious about not having a job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I believe you press quit.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels lost, uncertain about his or her future. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker has lost his job and the seeker should not worry about losing.	labels:Hi there, how can I help you today?
text:My friend has been quiet and non responsive for some time and I'm starting to worry about them. This is a pretty recent thing, ever since lockdown. The seeker felt scared to talk about a job loss. The supporter could tell the seeker that there will be some hard times ahead.	labels:Is this a close friend of yours that you would normally speak to every day or see on a regular basis?
text:Yes that's correct, however with lockdown I haven't seen any friends for a long time face to face. The seeker is concerned about his job prospects. The seeker may have some experience in the field of business.	labels:Ok so you have are close friend, who you used to engage with regularly and now you are worried because when you try and contact them, they aren't responding.
text:Yes that's the issue. I think lockdown is affecting people in many ways and I want to make sure they are OK. The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could also share the same experience and suggestion to the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I can tell that you feel a lot for your friend and it shows that you care about lot about them.
text:Yes I do. Now what should I do about them as other friends in our peer group are also concerned? The seeker says his friend is upset so he is worried about the issue. The supporter could tell the seeker that his friend wants to stay silent and is scared. The seeker could tell that he is scared.	labels:Ok, I understand. Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?
text:I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm not quite sure how to do that? The seeker felt lonely and worried about the fact that they are not having a strong relationship. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is not a problem related to their own relationship with their boyfriend.	labels:You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch.
text:I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion.. The seeker feels scared about losing their job and their family. The supporter could tell the seeker the person is worried because a lot of times they have a person that is concerned but it is not for them to decide what to do.	labels:I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.
text:Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days. The seeker is scared of being separated from his family. The supporter could tell the seeker the family is being affected by COVID isolation because of the lack of family ties. The supporter could tell that the family is a bad and isolated place and that this is NOT their home. The supporter could also tell that the family is not being treated very well. The supporter could tell that the family is not being treated poorly	labels:That is true. Mental health issues have increased  significantly since lockdowns began. As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.
text:That is true. I think they are probably very busy at the moment but as they are typically so outgoing it did strike me as odd. What else would you suggest? The seeker said he does not want to get stuck at work and he is worried about getting locked out. The seeker could say there are other friends of his in the community and he has their support. I suggest you try contacting the person who is going through the same situation.	labels:You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in.
text:I think I'll give that a try. Maybe they don't have time but a fun relaxing group chat might be the way forward. Thanks for this suggestion. I'll give this a go. The seeker feels anxious about what they are going through. In the previous conversation with the supporter, he was anxious about the emotional state of the seeker. In that conversation, the seeker felt anxious and worried about losing his job.	labels:No problem happy to help..	episode_done:True
text:Hi, how can I help you?\nHi, is someone there? I need some help. I'm feeling really bad. The seeker asks the supporter for help. The supporter can tell the seeker that the seeker is feeling negative about his job.	labels:What's the problem?
text:My company just laid off 10% of the workforce and furloughed another 10%. I'm worried I'm going to be in the next round. The seeker feels sad about losing his job. The sponsor can help the seeker find a job.	labels:Why do you think you are the next round? Do you know how did they choose them?
text:Just based on their tenure and job experience. I'm around the same level. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell him that the seeker is not comfortable with his current job.	labels:I know, this year was stressful for everyone in our planet, so you are not alone. What's the worst scenario do you think will happen?
text:I know, but I am the only one in the family making money and we need this job. My wife was laid off earlier this year. If I'm laid off, we can't afford our home. We are already dipping into savings because my wife lost her job. The seeker feels anxious. At this point he knows he will not be able to do a good job. The supporter may say what he doesn't want to say.	labels:Did you try searching for new jobs?
text:I tried and had a couple of interviews but the response was pretty much "you're too experienced" or "we have cheaper applicants than you". Obviously not that direct but reading between the lines you know? The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Hmmmm, First of all stop being panicked, You still have your job.
text:I guess so. I can't help feeling a sense of dread though like I'm next. The seeker gets worried about finding the job. The support was not mentioned.	labels:The good thing is you anticipate losing your job, so you have the advantage here.
text:How so? The seeker feels scared that he or she will never be able to find a job again. The supporter should ask about the job that they are looking for.	labels:You can prepare yourself for that! yes, as simple as this. Search for new jobs, get help from your wife and friends.
text:What kind of help? The seeker feels afraid about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and advise the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Search locally and online, If you try enough you will see the results soon.
text:I've been searching for the past month. It's just been so hard trying to break through to an interview. The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could reveal some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Help in searching for jobs and supporting you emotionally.
text:It's been frustrating. I've sent out 50 resumes and got 3 interviews. The seeker feels like he has a job to fill. He is a young man, but his job isn't yet ready.	labels:Let me be straight ok? you somehow don't have any other options but searching. You can do it! who knows! maybe you will get a better job.
text:Do you have any tips? It just seems I can't find a thng. thing. The seeker feels anxious or worried. The seeker could tell the seeker the anxiety is getting stronger.	labels:Look at this situation as an opportunity, you still have your job and you can search for even a better job.
text:Yes, that's what I've been trying to do. I just can't find anything. Or get my foot in the door anywhere. The seeker feels scared. The supporter should ask for information on the job description and how to get help.	labels:Don't get disappointed, put effort, seek new methods for searching, research online.
text:Do you know any new methods for searching? The seeker felt that he is in a better position to seek a new job because of his experience with the online search.	labels:Ask around locally, maybe there is an organization locally for support in this pandemic situation.
text:Yeah that's been a problem. With cuts in the budget my local resource center is closed down. Anyway I know you tried your best. Thanks for listening. The seeker is worried about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker a situation is coming to an end, but it is not over yet.	labels:I hope I could help a little.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker is happy. The seeker is happy. It is a good feeling for him but the seeker is not happy.	labels:Hello, how are you today?
text:I'm not feeling great. I applied for a job recently which took a lot of time. I now have an interview and it's in 3 days. I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare. The seeker feels anxious about getting out of the house. The seeker could also share some information about his job.	labels:I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview.. What makes you feel that you are unprepared?
text:The thing is I'm really good at interviews but usually it takes time to prepare. It's a corporate interview so I need to prepare behavioural answers to certain scenarios. In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory. The seeker feels happy. The supporter could tell the seeker the fear is over.	labels:Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.
text:Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time. The seeker feels more stressed about making a new start. The follower could ask for more information about what it feels like to have a new job.	labels:I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?
text:Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it? Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work. The seeker feels overwhelmed and stressed. The supporter should ask to see the seeker.	labels:Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?
text:Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. The seeker could ask any other question that he or she can think of to help him or her prepare for the job interview. If these were the questions he or she would ask the seeker.	labels:That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.
text:Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however? The seeker is worried about the stress. The supporter could ask for tips on how to get more information to the seeker.	labels:Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?
text:There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually! The seeker felt like he could not lose his job if he were to do something to get help. The supporter could tell him the issue is not very serious, but the seeker is worried about losing his job. The supporter may have already taken the action.	labels:Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.
text:Thanks for that. I think the key to this is confidence so I'll go with it. Feeling more relaxed about it all now, The seeker felt anxious about getting an interview. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not sure what to get her for the job, but she would feel confident that she will be able to fit in.	labels:Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:No that's great. Thanks from your help. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.	episode_done:True

The seeker feels very lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker she is sad and sad.	labels:How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?.

The seeker feels very anxious about falling ill. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is worried about falling ill. The seeker could tell the seeker that he is worried about being ill.	labels:It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?.
text:yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear. The seeker says he knows what he wants to do.	labels:I realise that this must be difficult but isn't it best to get things out into the open?.
text:it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. The seeker feels anxious about finding a job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is worried about making money.	labels:I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated..
text:possibly. i'd prob be better being away from the situation. The seeker felt the need to be careful with any feelings he may have. The supporter would say the same thing.	labels:Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run..
text:I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. The seeker feels angry and concerned about his job. The supporter could tell that the seeker is not doing much work and seems to be not doing so well.	labels:You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?
text:it gives me an upper edge and more clout. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that he's worried. The believer could tell the seeker how he feels and how he feels. It can be difficult to communicate with the seeker.	labels:In what way does it do that?.

The seeker is confused and scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss was real.	labels:I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board..

text:thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that he feels stressed. The person should have a conversation with the seeker.	labels:I think it's time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies?.
text:yes but it's less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense. The seeker feels scared and stressed about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown?.

text:true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don't think it's a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. The seeker felt his friends were too scared to come to him. The supporter could tell the seeker she is worried about his safety.	labels:I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened?.
text:yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. The seeker is worrying about his career and his career will end. It is hard to see how this will work out for him.	labels:Do you feel guilty about this?.
text:now that im talking to him i do a little. it felt good at the time like i was getting back at him. you can tell this is a very twisted situation. The seeker felt guilty.	labels:Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?.
text:not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn't have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one. The seeker feels relieved that he has found a good job. This is not the first time he felt that way. He felt that he was getting laid but he is not the first.	labels:I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure.
text:thank ya for listening. i think it'll clarify itself in time. The seeker feels he was wronged. He feels he is being bullied.

text:Hi there. How are you doing today?\nI'm  good. Getting cold outside. Temp dropping over 20 degrees. Brr. The seeker feels uncomfortable. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has to be careful and to do the right thing.	labels:Yes, I know! It's supposed to snow this week where I am.  So, I understand you are in need of someone to talk to. What's going on.
text:Oh no, I hate driving in the snow. Spun out one year- rather not drive in snow- at least when it's icy. My interest rate hit another credit card. Have to pay $80 more a month now. Hoping to find more work so I can pay it off faster. The seeker is afraid to leave his job. The supporter could inform the seeker of the potential job.	labels:Ah, so if I understand you correctly, your interest rate has increased, so you need to find another job to pay it off?
text:yeah cuz it was a no interest rate card and that expired so it started charging interest. I knew it was coming but need to work more hours now. The interest I pay every month will go down as I pay more of the principal off. I just hate it. The seeker feels nervous about work. The supporter could tell that the seeker has to work a long time to earn the money to pay off his loan.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Are you feeling stressed out about it?
text:Yes and no. Cuz I know I will pay it off within 3 years at the most. Probably closer to two years. I just don't like to wait and want to pay it off sooner if possible.

The seeker could tell the seeker that she may have to change her job to make a loan again. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is a jobless and that she needs to be helped. The seeker could also tell the seeker that she has a financial need to get the job	labels:I understand exactly how you feel. When I finished school, I wanted to pay off my student loans as soon as possible. I'm glad to hear that you are not too stressed about it though.
text:Yeah it's easier said than done. Btw I heard Biden might forgive student loans! Yay! Yeah cuz it bought a lot of items I needed so I'm happy I got them. The seeker asks if the seeker should ask for more details.	labels:I heard about Biden's plans as well! Luckily, I paid all of my debts already but I think it will be great for other people. Perhaps if you are unable to find another job to reduce the principal, you could try setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards the amount owed?
text:maybe they will reimburse you on what you paid. I could if i really discipline myself to. The seeker feels stressed and worries about his or her job. The supporter could tell the seeker the amount he or she would be paid for if he or she paid off his or her student loans.	labels:It's just a thought. Alternatively, I'm not sure if you typically get money for birthdays and the winter holidays, but you could commit some of that amount towards your principal amount.
text:I get some but I spend the money on myself- like chocolate! itll prob take me 2-3 years to pay it off. if i go too much into discrectionary money i feel deprived. The seeker felt stressed about the decision to leave home, the decision to change jobs, the decision to leave home or not leave home at all. The seeker could tell the seeker that they can pay back those debts to the principal and that the person in charge of the job will help him or her get in the car and get home.	labels:I understand that also. There needs to be some sort of balance. However, it sounds like you are a smart person and will make sure to pay off the amount responsibly. Everything will be okay!
text:absolutely. the time will go by fast enough and it will be paid off. ill make sure not to run the credit  cards so high next time. The seeker feels very stressed and is worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Sounds like you've learned an important lesson from this, and will work towards responsibly paying it off. I have faith in you!
text:thank ya! I think I'm fairly responsible. I like to have nice things and my credit card bill proves it lol. The seeker feels nervous and worries about paying off the loan. The supporter could tell the seeker the loan has been paid off (maybe for a few months). The supporter could suggest that they make a loan to cover any debt.	labels:Just find the right balance between pleasure and responsibility and you will be just fine! Are you feeling a bit better now after chatting?
text:yes very much so. thank ya! Have a great evening! Bye. The seeker feels afraid of losing her job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:You too!	episode_done:True

The supporter could tell the seeker that they would be so happy with her and how she will be a part of her life.	labels:i can understand and i have had to do the same thing. .

The supporter should provide support.	labels:I think you have to do what keeps you safe  and healthy.  you can tell her you are here for her, but that you will not watch her destroy her life/
text:I thought the same thing. I've had family members who were alcoholics and it was almost the same thing. I bailed them out till I saw it wasn't going to make a world of difference.. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not a big guy and he hates to lose his job because he is too strong.	labels:so your plan is to keep your distance, your friend will eventually see him for who he is.
text:How do I deal with the sadness of all this? The seeker does not feel sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can't trust his story.	labels:I would suggest joining  a group like Al-Anon.  It will be goof for you to talk to others in this situation.
text:Maybe so. I know I talk to family about it and they don't think it's that big of a deal. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss of his job is a big deal.	labels:It is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation. .
text:Yes, I guess it is not easy for them to understand. But she's been my friend for so many years, I just don't get it. What was that group Al-Anon? The seeker feels like he has been caught up in the wrong situation. He is worried about being out of control, he is worried about losing his job, he is worried about a job he didn't even want.	labels:I mean Non-Anon  -it is a 12 step program for loved ones of addicts. Is there anything else I can help you with?
text:I'll have to look into it.. The seeker feels afraid of losing her job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:okay.

text:Nice talking to you too. The seeker feels happy with her life and is happy with her job. She is in a position where she can have many friends.	labels:Bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter should talk about how scary he is and make the seeker feel scared.	labels:Hey, how are you today?
text:I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic. And it's the start of the second wave in my city. The seeker felt happy and relaxed.	labels:I completely understand what you are going though, indeed it is tough times.
text:yeah it sure has been since March this year for my city. The seeker felt scared. The supporter could tell the seeker the pandemic is coming, and that the pandemic has been started.	labels:So tell me, what are you going through your mind regarding the pandemic and the second wave?
text:There's kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn't really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don't know and it just boggles on my mind. The seeker is feeling scared. He is afraid to go out to a party, especially not for my friends, because he likes to stay out.	labels:Yes I understand, I'm from the east coast and I'm deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown..
text:I get that there's a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first wave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don't think they should be doing that too much. The seeker feels anxious and worried about the pandemic. The organizer asked if the organizer was worried about the situation, the organizer said "yeah I'm not worried" and they did not have enough information to speak to the organizer. The organizer then asked if the organizer would be there to meet in person with the organizer's office. The organizer did not say "yes" or "no" and they did not	labels:I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can't change the situation because it human nature..
text:it is. And that's sad but true. It's in our nature, as you say. It's in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. The seeker experiences a fear and a fear of not getting help. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the situation is difficult and that they should follow the rules, which it is not.	labels:However, we shouldn't let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.
text:yes I agree also. It's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. The seeker felt happy and well connected with her new life. She was also in a bad mood. She felt lonely and depressed. She feels the need for help.	labels:Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.
text:and yeah, that's the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that's really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. The seeker felt tired, tired, tired. In a way, this is my biggest fear. I want to go back to work and get my health back. Even if you have a good job and a good job. It is good for us, but it is not good enough to do something that is so important for us.	labels:Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself..
text:yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enough time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that's good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. The seeker feels confused and confused. The supporter should also be aware that he may be affected by his own inner turmoil and may want to help him adjust.	labels:I'm on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it. Trust me if accomplish 90% of it, that one hour me time will feel even better..
text:so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self-imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time-management, etc. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort. The seeker feels frustrated. The supporter needs to focus on making sense of the situation and keep themselves focused on their goals.	labels:Any improvement is still improvement!
text:true. My courses are nearly finished anyhow by the end of december. So after that, I will revamp my style in the new year and start anew. Anyhow that's all for now. I think you have provided some very valuable advice. And I will keep those in my mind on a daily basis. The seeker feels relieved.

text:I can't seem to connect with friends much anymore. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:That must be hard to not be with friends so much. Being social is human.

text:That could possibly work.  My friend is so much more receptive to my other friend in hearing her out.  Maybe she could assist. The seeker feels lonely. He feels very alone. The supporter could tell the seeker the friend is so lonely.	labels:That sounds like a great idea. It sounds like you are thinking of alternate paths to work through the friendship.  Your friend will appreciate all the efforts you are making to show you care.
text:Yes, I'm trying my best. The seeker feels stressed and scared. The supporter can tell the seeker it is not normal that people will think of you as a partner.

text:Not really, we were talking recently and she just didn't really want to hear my opinion and talked over me. Normally she's pretty good at listening. The seeker does not feel intimidated. The supporter could tell the seeker what to do about her, but it will be more important for the seeker to have experience.	labels:Well, everyone, including yourself, is entitled to an off day. Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how.
text:I guess that could be the case. What should I do then? The seeker feels a little guilty by not sharing his feeling. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is too anxious or anxious.	labels:Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.
text:So I should just ask her if something is going on? The seeker is angry but not afraid. The supporter can tell the seeker not to worry about getting rid of her boyfriend. The seeker would rather do the same thing.	labels:I would remember though, its ok for people to want to be left alone though if things are bad, sometimes they just need their space.
text:Ok, that makes sense, I can get like that. What if something isn't wrong though? The seeker feels afraid to go outside. The supporter should ask the seeker what's going on.	labels:I would just say something along the lines of: Hey, youre not acting like yourself today, anything you want to talk about? I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can.
text:Ok, that sounds like a good plan. I'm just a little worried that it won't work because she was acting really rude. So I feel like I don't really want to talk to her right now. The seeker feels frustrated and angry. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Well, youre own health and well being does come first. If you feel it wont get anywhere, give her some space and come back to it at another date if you think you both would be comfortable with it.
text:Okay. I think that sounds good. I'll give myself and hopefully her some time to calm down and then maybe ask if she want's to talk? The seeker feels confident and secure. The supporter could tell the seeker the circumstances are bad.	labels:That sounds like a solid plan.

Yeah, everyone including me, forgets that each individual has their own sets of things going on each day. Always good to look at it through their eyes a bit.
text:Yeah, I think it's hard to do that when you're upset too. The seeker tries to convince the supporter that she does want to be with her boyfriend. The supporter would say that everything is going well, but that nothing is really going well. The seeker would think that she is just a person.	labels:It definitely is. I guess thats what makes us human though. Take care!	episode_done:True

text:My friends want to go out all the time.  How can we connect during a Skype? The seeker 's friend asked about the events of the previous day in Nashville.	labels:Pick a time you'll both be available, and you'll both need the program. It's quite easy to use and there will be youtube videos that'll help you set it up, should you need it.
text:Do you do any activities together over Skype? The seeker feels anxious and anxious about staying with them.	labels:We usually just chat about our week or get advice on normal things, sometimes we'll play a drinking game and be goofy together..

The supporter can tell the seeker that he should not get close to his partner.	labels:I can understand that and it's definitely frustrating.

text:I've been out of work since Covid closed down the live event industry in March. the unemployment system still hasn't processed any of my claims, and I have been surviving off of what I can make driving for doordash, which hasn't been a lot. The seeker is trying to figure out which job he is going to have to accept the offer from his employer and which job he does not.	labels:That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren't making a lot that is still something!
text:ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can't really go out after dark, and I'm worried I'm driving it too much and it's going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I've applied for would hire me to do something form home. The seeker feels worried about losing his job because of the unemployment system. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I completely understand.

The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX (which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing.

I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop, you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible. Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee.

text:what alternative? the police are so backed up everywhere they can't respond fast enough. they should be our first line of defense here in the us against bad guys but that doesnt happen or they ccant always be trusted to respond quickly and efficiently so i feel we have to take it upon ourselves. if someone were to break in and has a gun.... i mean.. criminals dont get guns the legal way anyway you know. what should i do...throw a knife at them? lol. The seeker feels anxious about being in the business of protecting his family.

text:Thank you, very sorry for yours. I do think of the good times and I had a lot of those with her but she was also the person who was there for me when I was sad. I was closest to her in my family. Hard when I remember that I can. Cannot call her. The seeker feels helpless and is unsure. The supporter could ask the seeker for advice on the situation.	labels:Yeah i get that, something will happen with my kid and i think, man dad would love to hear that. What i take from that is happiness knowing that i had him there before, knowing that he was there for me.

Did you try to explain to him that his thoughts were not true?
text:yeah but how should i start because he misjudged me and his girlfriend its a sensitive issue. The seeker felt depressed and confused about how he was going to communicate his feelings. He could say he was feeling depressed and that he was trying to hide some feelings. However, he also felt his feelings were being suppressed.	labels:I would  start off by telling him that you were sorry that he had those thoughts but there is no truth to it and the fact that he does not trust you enough to know that is hurtful to you and her. If that does not work then you might need to take some time to reflect and figure out if that is a friendship worth trying to save, you may find yourself better off without a friend who shows no trust in you.
text:please give me some suggegtion that what should i do now. The seeker feels depressed and sad and is worried about losing his job. It is not clear if the seeker is concerned about his situation or not.	labels:I would continue trying to reach out to him and until you can get in touch with him maybe find some thing to do to occupy your mind as to where it does not bother you so much. do you have any hobbies?

The sponsor could tell the seeker that it is not the job, but that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:You feel left out out. Is that what you're saying?
text:Maybe not so much left out but moreso left behind. I really feel like everyone else is where they're supposed to be in life and I'm just floundering here without a clue what to do next.

The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is not with her and that she needs help to understand what is going on.	labels:I see. You know if you get a mirror and look in it you'll see you are a natural leader. Here's the proof; You realized there's a problem. 2. You reached out for help. 3. You are aware of issues that are bigger than yourself. those are qualities of a leader. Have you thought about starting an online support group for parents? You would be good at it I bet.
text:I really appreciate you saying that. I used to be in a bunch of online support groups for single parents but life kind of got in the way and I didn't have a lot of time to focus on myself. I always had to be there for my son. The seeker gives a short talk about how to start a support group for single parents. The supporter could tell the seeker the support group is for single parents but it can be a little scary.	labels:That's understandable. Most parents feel like you do so you're not alone. When I feel closed off I write. I make up stories where I'm always the heroe. Don't laugh. I always overcome some issue. I also write letters just to get out what I'm feeling. It helps and you should try it. Start a diary or write letters to your son so you can share them with him one . Are these activities you might like to try? Friend are you still there? Hello?
text:I do think I would like to try those activities! Sometimes I don't want to bother my kid with my problems but he's like the best friend I have.

The seeker feels scared about their future and that of their family. The supporter could tell the seeker what happened to their parents.	labels:Sorry to hear that.  I absolutely understand, it's been hard on most people having to deal with the current state of affairs and losing people. . Do you think things will improve?

I lost a teacher some time ago and I've been thinking a lot about when things might improve.  A year seems plausible.. Since it's so hard, are there things you think you can do to cheer yourself up?

The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell him that everything is so bad and he has to think about what he can do to help the seeker.	labels:Sorry to hear that.

The supporter could tell the seeker there are other job opportunities that she should consider.	labels:Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering?  I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her.
text:Yes, I do, but I can't talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng  tough time.  I don't feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering.  We may need to help him financially.  I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. The seeker asked if he can meet the person who needs help. The seeker does not answer.	labels:That is reasonable.  And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe?  Or perhaps provide your son financial support?
text: I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don't get too down and depressed. The seeker ks for some guidance. To find some information on what's going on with her, the seeker needs to make sure his or her goals are met.	labels:You are doing everything you can.  Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings.

text:yeah I am okay. Just daily stresses such as disrupted life routines from the pandemic and growing anxiety as my city is facing the beginning of the second wave. The seeker can report a person feels anxiety to the counsellor, the counsellor tries to find the person who feels the same.	labels:i surely understand you. this pandemic has been really stressful..
text:yeah you bet. for example, I only go out once or twice a week for my job, and once every two weeks for groceries. And that's it. But even then, when I have to be in close quarters with coworkers and even to go out for groceries, that scares me. The seeker feels anxious and worried about the need to stay positive. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not feeling well, and that he is not ready to move on.	labels:yeah, people are not social distancing enough.. but wearing a mask and then using sanitizer should at least give us a bit of a confidence.
text:like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks! it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar story and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:at least now i hope the city will put in more restrictions and mandate mask wearing.
text:yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope. well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5. The seeker had a lot of time to explain to the supporter. The seeker can explain the situation at work and explain what he is feeling like.	labels:have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something.
text:too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. The seeker feels uneasy about the change to public transportation. The supporter could tell the seeker that they will have to change the laws to allow more public transportation. The seeker could also point out that there is no new law or regulation on transportation.	labels:hmm, that's a bummer.
text:yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say. The seeker felt sad about being forced to go through a social event with his employer. He would often get angry at his employees and they would tell him they couldn't trust him.	labels:okay.
text:but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support. But thanks for that advice, it's a good idea. The seeker feels relieved and content, he is happy that he is not the center of attention and that his job is being handled properly. The supporter could tell the seeker not to hide or don't talk.	labels:that's great. having a supportive friend/family is so much a blessing during this pandemic.

It is better now but my fear is coming back due to the rising cases. The seeker feels a sense of hope, but he is worried about the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation has gotten worse and that it is time to move on.	labels:yeah, i can understand.. do you have any hobbies or interests that you can work on to help you put your mind away for sometime?
text:yeah thanks for listening. And this does impact my daily routines, from my workout patterns, sleep patterns, and diet. yeah somewhat. but not productive energy. I tend to be lethargic, immobile at my computer for long times, surfing the net aimlessly when I should be studying, and just distracted. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details, but it has to be something that will help out the seeker.	labels:there are a good number of online forums for most of the hobbies/interests.. that'll help you share your work and also get some additional ideas.
text:and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated. okay yeah good idea. I can look for more videos too on such resources. like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project. The seeker feels depressed about his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:putting away my phone has helped me a lot. also, i have designed a daily routine to include more of the tasks that i like.

And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way. ok yeah great ideas. The seeker feels anxious and worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:yeah, try to start learning a new musical instrument of your choice. maybe just 30-60 mins everyday.
text:I have started to put away my phone. as I realize that I use it a lot too. The seeker does not have any other hobbies or interests besides going to the gym. The seeker does not have any other hobbies or interests except doing a little bit of cooking.	labels:nice.
text:So I put it at the opposite end of my room for example. started doing that lately and so the screen time has reduced somewhat. so just trying to channel my productive energy into finishing school deadlines. The seeker feels frustrated and depressed and has been so depressed that he has been in denial about the time he is going to have to get on the computer for a while.	labels:social media and then this relentless flow of covid news/info is also stressful.
text:yeah for sure, especially following up news from around the world and in the states. just stressful loads of news just catching up to daily events. and as for daily schedule, yes I have kind of more control on that too as I try to write down what I should do now and set an alarm to start doing this at this time etc, especially in juggling my school work. but yeah your ideas are great and match my thinking exactly. The seeker felt it was important to focus on the problem. In this conversation, the seeker felt they needed to be more active.	labels:yepp. i read a book - 'atomic habits'. and kind of designed a daily routine. this helping me a lot and reducing stress as well..

Thanks a lot for that. The seeker is stressed. The supporter should explain how to avoid or manage stress in the future.	labels:yepp. and if you try to remove or avoid those triggers, it will really help.

The supporter could tell the seeker that he has a good job and that he can improve his skills.	labels:oh no that is terrible, are you able to support yourself financially without him?

I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it. The seeker feels hopeless. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is hopeless because he has lost his job and that he would not be able to support himself financially again.	labels:That is cruel, I am sure you are in shock, to leave without an explanation, or a real one is terrible. So you have no contact withim what so ever?
text:No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone. The seeker feels that he will be able to secure the job.	labels:Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back..
text:I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens. The seeker feels a sense of relief, not guilt, but also the sense of knowing that they are still with him. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are in love with each other.	labels:Well I am sure it sucks and feels a bit lonely. But if you dont want him back have a glass of wine and celebrate the you, you deserve the best and nothing less.

And you can pet it and it is happy to see you any time,
text:Thanks for listening to me gripe about this, I was just shocked, you know? Like ten years gone down the drain but I guess that's life. A kitten definitely sounds like a good idea. The seeker feels fearful about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Sometimes it just is, but out of all the bad things something good comes out of it you might not just see it now.

I personally have been trying to get up a little earlier in the morning and enjoy my coffee with the sunrise and a scroll through Instagram. I also already have to schedule and routinize my day because I work and go to school from home, so I make sure to give myself breaks where I literally must get up and leave my desk, be in another room for a little while. .
text:Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it's time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle.

The seeker s some experience with the flu and the influenza virus.	labels:Yeah they have kicked the can down to local governments, local governments kick the can down to the citizens.  It's absurd. No on wants to take responsibility for taking responsibility. . It's a very uncertain situation and it's a psychological reality that when we don't have physical or metnal security, it's extremely hard for a human being to progress through stages in life or learn new skill as well or at all.
text:I guess it's like you said before, we can only change ourselves. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:So everyone's plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit's going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable. .

The supporter could tell the seeker the supporter is happy for her to be with the seeker.	labels:You can master it within in a month, you are already getting a head start.
text:yeah this is my third go through the entire course, the third round of studying. So that the knowledge would be fresh in my mind. just the entire next week is all I have left to get through like 6 units of readings. The seeker feels very stressed after his first reading. The supporter could tell the seeker that no matter what he read, it is not going to change. The seeker could tell the seeker that this is not a normal world and that his own experience is different.	labels:Yes the pandemic has created a lot of challenges for routines and schedules.
text:plus finish up the assignment and I have a part-time job, and plus doing some catching with the other course which is all due next month after this course. yeah it sure has. I can go on and on about that too. The seeker feels stressed and worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that they lose their job and then it is a real pain.	labels:I am confident you can succeed, it sounds like you have a plan and dedication.
text:And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate. So just a pattern of that going on lately. thanks just gonna do my very best and be mature and catch up because my marks have been good but have been procrastinating, lazy, and slow with everything since the pandemic. The seeker felt anxious about not being able to get the assignments and that would not be easy. The supporter could tell the seeker that her problem was not with her task but with the other course.	labels:That is a tough cycle to break..
text:yeah it's stupid. Once I am done with these two courses, I can finally stop sleeping so late. Because regardless of the courses, I have been sleeping at around the same time, which is late almost every night, since the pandemic started. The seeker feels overwhelmed with the work and the challenges he has to cope with. The supporter could tell the seeker that if he is in a situation and he is doing something like this, then he should do it.	labels:I think you're saying you will have go put your nose to the grind.
text:so it will be a good time for me to take a breather and reset my bad bad habits and circadian rhythm after these two courses. and get back to some normalcy in my life routines. it will literally be a fresh start, next january. The seeker feels depressed and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker to work on the skills of the seeker.	labels:Yes, definitely allow yourself time to breathe.
text:yeah exactly, nose to the grind. yeah too many bad habits from the pandemic and social isolation. Excessive procrastination, not working out much, eating pattern is bad, sleep pattern is bad, etc. The seeker feels frustrated about all the pasts that he has experienced. He feels like the situation is too difficult for him to do anything about.	labels:I think you sound very capable, despite the amount of stress you're under.
text:its all linked and most of it is due to the pandemic and the studies is just a reinforcement of this loop, fuels it actually. The seeker felt that he should have said a word and a prayer. He was scared of being called a liar. He felt scared of being called a liar because he is afraid of getting cheated and being lied to.	labels:You can get back on track with those healthy behaviors.
text:Thank you. I am getting better as each day brings me closer to the first exam. I am actually catching up and I feel guilty of myself for the bad habits and not doing the courses as well as I should but just at the end, I feel like I am getting a grip on it again. Thank you for your advice. I hope I can break my bad cycles like I said. The seeker can tell the seeker that he is getting better.	labels:You are welcome. I definitely relate to how you feel.
text:Thanks. Yeah I can see that you understand. That's good. The seeker feels anxious. He tries to keep things calm and keeps going.	labels:I believe in you!
text:thank you very much! I will continue to study after we chat. I am just taking a break. this has been a good refresher break. So thank you for your kind words and your trust in me. The seeker felt depressed but happy. The supporter could tell the seeker the feeling is not bad at all.	labels:Same, have a good night and get some rest.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how can I help you this evening? .\nI am really worried about the future. The seeker feels scared to break up with his boyfriend because he is afraid that he could break up with her.	labels:That's a very understandable worry to have, and I'm sorry you're dealing with that right now. .
text:The pandemic and economic downturn keep me up at night. The seeker feels relieved to find things are going good.<|endoftext|>	labels:Is there a specific path or event in the future that you are worried about? .
text:Yes, how the pandemic will play out mostly. The seeker feels worried about the future. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Things are very uncertain these days.  I certainly have never experienced anything like it. .
text:I guess we are all in the same boat. The seeker feels upset by his job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to stay focused and stay positive.	labels:Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. .
text:I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged. The seeker s stressed and worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that the world is going to collapse.	labels:Or constantly terrified. We can't control the world, or even another person really, but we can control ourselves. .
text:How do you comfort yourself that it's not that bad? The seeker lonely and worries about the negative aspects of life. The supporter could tell the seeker the negative aspects of life and how they can be avoided.	labels:Well, I don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all.  But I do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.
text:Thanks for your insights. It is helpful to talk it out. The seeker anxious about the future. The supporter could also share similar experience and suggest the seeker to keep positive.	labels:And I schedule my day, even though I'm working and going to school from home.  I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing. .
text:Now is the time to focus and be disciplined.. I will take your advice. The seeker be stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating. .
text:Yes, the short days are a major depressant. I feel like those around me dont understand my anxiety. The seeker feeling that there is nothing much to be done about his anxiety. The support should help to calm down and focus on what the situation is about.	labels:That must be frustrating.  I've learned there are just some people I can't trust with my vulnerabilities. .
text:I may overtrust. The seeker depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the negative feelings or negative emotions that were in some way associated with that person.	labels:But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it. .
text:You're good at this. Thanks for your support. Ending chat when timer allows. The seeker look at the situation and ask: Are you feeling stressed?  What is going on?  What do you think will happen?  And the seeker may respond: What do you think will happen?  What will happen to you?  	labels:Sure thing, I wish you luck, and thank you for the compliment :-) .	episode_done:True
text:Hello I would like to talk to you regarding my daily stresses. The seeker feels fearful about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:sure, please go ahead and share your story.
text:pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now. The seeker is worried about his physical and mental health as well as his physical and mental health in general. In this conversation, the seeker gets worried about his mental health and his physical and mental health in general.	labels:it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?
text:yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:that's great! Friends can be big help.
text:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. The seeker feels sad and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the feeling is not being normal and the real reason is that the person is in a difficult situation.	labels:If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.
text:So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. The seeker feels stressed by the situation he or she is in. The supporter could ask the seeker to let go of his or her worries and just let go of any problems that could be caused by the pandemic.	labels:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.
text:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym. The seeker doesn't see anything wrong with keeping up with his work. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is in the right place and that he is still in a good place.	labels:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.
text:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. The seeker felt anxious and worried. He is not afraid of having to work hard to make the next step and he feels he needs to work harder to get that thing done.	labels:I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.
text:But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too. sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. The seeker felt scared. The supporter could say he feels scared because he was alone with his girlfriend. The seeker could say he is worried that he will lose his job. The supporter could say it is not really possible to get a job at a business. He could say he is afraid of being lost or lost by the business. The seeker could also say he feels scared because it is not something he has the	labels:that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.
text:yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. The seeker felt stressed. The seeker felt frustrated, depressed, and depressed. In this conversation, the seeker thought of the reasons why he felt stressed, and the reasons why he was depressed.	labels:I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.
text:And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good. The seeker feels very lonely and worried about the loss of his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss of his job is hard for him and it's not going to be that easy. The seeker could also tell the seeker that there are people in the organization that she can rely on. And the supporter could tell the seeker that he needs to make the sacrifices to stay in the club and that this is	labels:I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.
text:And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up. Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this. The seeker was in a moment by moment interview with the person he is thinking about. The seeker did not speak any words.	labels:it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.
text:So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings. The seeker feels a sense of hope, but his fears are gone. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.
text:So thank you for that and for listening and understanding. Yes will continue to do that. The seeker is afraid. The supporter could ask for more details about his/her condition.	labels:It was nice talking to you too.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker is worried about the loss of his job. There are no options. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people with special needs who would help the seeker.	labels:Hello, how are you doing?
text:I am hanging in there as well as I can be. The seeker feels uneasy about losing his job. The supporter can share some similar experiences and suggest the seeker to stay positive.<|endoftext|>	labels:What's been going on?
text:I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous. The seeker asks the support for him to be more positive about how he feels. The support could help him in a positive way.	labels:It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.
text:It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that. The seeker feels anxious about lost work. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss of job is a serious problem and that it will need to be dealt with quickly.	labels:Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.
text:Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability. The seeker is worried about falling out of the job market. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her that can help her.	labels:I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?
text:Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.. The seeker feels worried about being left alone. The supporter could tell the seeker that the person around her is not safe.	labels:I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.
text:I would hope so. The seeker felt depressed. The sponsor could tell the seeker that there are many people around him to make him feel better.	labels:I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.
text:Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away. The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.
text:For the record, you are doing a really really good job. I really appreciate your time and kind words. Thank you for empathizing and relating. I appreciate your assistance. I feel a lot better about this now :). The seeker feels anxious, worried, depressed and depressed. They are all feeling it.	labels:You are very welcome. (: It's my pleasure to help in any way I can.	episode_done:True

text:I've been feeling really sad lately. I think I have depression. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter should ask for more details about the problem.	labels:Is there any reason that triggered  your sadness?
text:It's 2020 so there's been a lot going on, but I've been struggling with this before all of that. 2020 has made it much worse though. The seeker feels depressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker the need to stay positive while experiencing positive emotions.	labels:I am sorry you feel this way. Do you live with friends or family?
text:I live on my own... well at least as the only human. I have a dog. The seeker is afraid of losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is leaving his job because he has a problem.	labels:That is great that you at least have your dog. They're great companion.
text:She is amazing and my love and joy. On days I feel I cannot get out of bed and I don't have work, I get up for her. The seeker feels discouraged and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are working on the problem of their own and that they need to move on.	labels:How about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?
text:I wish. We haven't had the time recently to connect due to being so busy. Do you have any tips or ticks for things I can do by myself? The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could say that he is not a good fit. The seeker could say that he has a bad attitude and that he needs to improve.	labels:Of course. Now that covid is closing everything. You can use that time to take a course online for free. Or you can pursue your hobbies.
text:Right. Online courses are fun. The seeker felt tired. The supporter should start a course for him to focus on at home.	labels:Have you tried seeking therapist?
text:I need to. I just haven't had the money to see one. They're expensive. The seeker feels scared and worried about the future. The supporter could ask if there are any others who could help.	labels:I think there are quite a few hotline for free, obviously not as good as your personal one, however you can use that when you need to talk to an expert.
text:Yeah.... The seeker gives a list of therapists, but he doesn't have any suggestions on how to get one.	labels:I understand how you feel, I also find myself more depressed this year than ever.
text:2020 has not been fun to say the least. I am hoping 2021 is a much better year. Thank you for listening to me. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could explain the reason why.	labels:Me too, I have been trying to teach myself the "one day at a time" mindset to not being paranoid about the future.	episode_done:True
text:hi. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the job is not good, bad, or bad.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:im good. getting tired. had a long day. hola? The seeker feels very anxious about his job. The supporter could ask the seeker to go with him to his room next to his desk.	labels:It sounds like you worked really hard today. How are you taking care of yourself?
text:im good. just talked to my friend who is going in for heart surgery next week. The seeker feels depressed but is able to feel more confident and he feels more comfortable and happy.	labels:That must be really hard. I'm glad that you were able to make time for your friend who is going through a difficult time.
text:thank ya. yeah it's important im there for him right now. he has to be nervous. they're going to open 4 or 5 valves. The seeker worries that there could be an issue. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around him to make her feel good.	labels:It sounds like you are handling the situation well, given the stressful circumstance. What are some things you are doing to cope with this difficult situation?
text:thank ya. nothing that much different. i told my sister about it. she seems understanding about it. The seeker felt that they are not going to be able to care for their friend right now. The supporter could suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:It's wonderful that you have a support network that you trust and that you can talk with about this. I know that talking through things is really helpful for me too. Have you considered seeking professional help during this time?
text:nope. i feel that i get enough support from family. it might've been an option if I didn't have a strong support system. The seeker felt depressed about not getting support because of the job loss. The sponsor could give something back to the seeker for the money he lost. The sponsor could help the seeker make money.	labels:That's fantastic. Having family around during a tough season like this must be such a blessing. It's great that you can be there for your friend, almost as if they were part of your family, too.
text:yeah they feel like part of the family. i've known them since i was in college 20 years ago. we haven't always talked the whole time but.... The seeker feels that he and his friends are not going to be able to get through this situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay positive.	labels:20 years is a long time! It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!
text:thank ya. him and I are there for each other. We dated briefly at first but have been friends ever since. He said I was the one who got away. But he was the one who ended it lol. The seeker feels very lonely and worried about being alone. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:It sounds like you and him have had quite the history, but your friendship has proven to remain strong through thick and thin (20 years!). I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be for him to be waiting for surgery, and I'm sure it means the world to him that you are by his side. How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?
text:It's been good. We've been talking about Covid and the election too. I know I'd be nervous to go in for heart surgery. The seeker feels insecure about going through this time without him. He feels that, like I told him, getting help in the future is a good thing.	labels:That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other?
text:just being there for each other as a listening ear. The seeker feels stressed and nervous. The supporter could tell the seeker that it will be hard for him to be with his girlfriend and to stay with her.	labels:It's so easy to feel alone these days. Sometimes being present is all you can do, but it's the absolute best thing that you can do. Keep going, you're doing great!
text:thank ya! nity nite. The seeker feels alone and insecure. The supporter could tell the seeker that he feels safe.	labels:You're welcome! Thank you for being a wonderful friend, the world needs more people like you. Take care of yourself :)	episode_done:True
text:Hi. I am looking for support for depression.  My fiance died four years ago today and I am very sad. The seeker feels depressed and anxious about his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the reason for his depression is because of the loss of support for his co-worker.	labels:I am sorry to hear about your loss. How do you feel throughout the day?
text:Very sad.  I think about him often. The seeker feels very sad. The supporter should share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay optimistic.	labels:It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.
text:Yes but how much time? The seeker feels very sad and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the problem will not end.	labels:Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.
text:I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him. The seeker feels stressed. The seeker needs to be physically and emotionally strong to cope with this loss.	labels:I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.
text:Yes, I do try.  Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward? The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the feelings are trying to escape her.	labels:I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?
text:Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle. The seeker feels happy for his boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker about his experience.	labels:That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?
text:actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you. i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well. The seeker feels relieved. The supporter should ask if the seeker has changed his or her thinking and do some kind of emotional counseling.	labels:Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.
text:i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself. I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals. The seeker feels excited about his new hobby and his future. The supporter could tell the seeker the only thing he will need now is something to have fun.	labels:I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?
text:hmmm.  i love tacos.  and stews.  cheesecake. i used to bake ... but i'm diabetic so that's probably not such a good idea any more.  and since we're working at home now i can't bake and take it into the office for people to enjoy. The seeker feels excited about having a new hobby.  he also feels like the goal should be to have a new occupation.  he likes to be able to stay in touch with his family, work, and be involved in the local community. 	labels:Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.
text:oh my yes, the Cheesecake Factory has amazing cheesecake. I am going to go now. Thank you very much for your support. It helps to have an "ear" ... just to be able to talk about it and be reminded that it's all going to be okay.  Plus, that there's cheesecake in the world, so it can't all be bad, right? The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.	episode_done:True

text:Ive been feeling like other people dont like me. The seeker is worried about the loss of work. The supporter can tell the seeker to avoid working every day.	labels:If I understand you correctly, do you assume people dislike you even if you can't tell for sure?

Have you explained just how much of an issue it is to them and flat out tell them you saw them spending money on junk etc when they could have given to you . Something is better than nothing . Maybe work out a plan of 50 a week if they work?

The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is not his own money.	labels:And depending on how much of a  friend they are you need to see if this is worth losing friendship over.

But the other side is do you want this person to be your friend if you can't trust them and they are showing you no disrespect or attempt to pay you back?
text:It's a good plan. Due to lockdown restrictions, I am unable to travel places. May be if I show up at their doors, they'll pay me back. I am gonna see if talking to them and asking for small payments works first. The seeker feels scared about what is coming. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:Awesome!  Good luck! If that doesn't work we can chat again and try something else. Keep safe and Keep the faith .  Personally I would recommend praying if you believe as I do!!!

I use Zoom to meetup with family and friends.  I had never heard of it until this pandemic hit.
text:Yeah i havent heard of it either before covid. I use it sometimes for class but never for chatting with friends. I just wish we could hang out again you know? The seeker feels afraid for his life and his job. The supporter could be asked about his job and what he is going through during the time he is away.	labels:I most certainly do know!  I just think to myself daily that this vaccine is going to get things back to normal.  Hang on, we're almost there.  In the meantime I suggest Zoom.  It really does make things somewhat less isolating.
text:Thank goodness the vaccine is being developed. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask the seeker questions like "Are you feeling better?" "What do you think about your daily life?" and "What does it mean to you to be alive today?"	labels:We're almost there!
text:Yeah i guess ill give zoom a try. do you and your friends do anything on zoom or just chat? The seeker feels afraid about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:And if you have an iphone facetime some folks.  Zoom and Facetime are my friends now.  lol I almost daily at least Facetime my best friend. Especially in the evenings.
text:Yeah I think ill try that. Chatting with my friends and seeing them (online) will hopefully make me feel better. thanks :) The seeker feels that some people are scared of not knowing their doctor. In this conversation, the seeker feels worried about not knowing his or her doctor. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I would try it.  Also Meetup is doing virtual meetings. . You're welcome!  We have to look out for one another!
text:Ill give them a shot :) thanks for your time. have  a good day. The seeker feels very worried about losing his job and the potential for him to lose it. The supporter could also tell the seeker about the job situation.	labels:Sounds good! You're more than welcome.  You do the same.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, how are you today?\nokay right now. The seeker feels positive and happy. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is time to start looking for work.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?
text:i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out..
text:i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good. The seeker feels upset about not having a wife, but the supporter would tell him she could have her own.	labels:That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.
text:she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done.  she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality.  her background is similiar to mine,  i cannot abandon her as her other family has done. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to be with someone for a long time, so they will be together a lot of times.  she doesn't know that she will be back home with her boyfriend and will need support.	labels:That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?
text:on antidepressant meds, COVID makes it hard to keep in touch with provider, your comparison about the oxygen mask is a good one. . The seeker felt uncomfortable with the way COVID is treating him. The supporter could tell the seeker that he can't take his medication with him, unless they let him take his medication.	labels:I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.
text:a possible path to look into. thanks. The seeker feels like he can't leave his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that he cannot leave her. She should tell the seeker that he doesn't want to move back to her.	labels:Of course, here's the link: namimainlinepa.org/online-and-telephone-support-groups/.
text:thanks. may be a good time to close on a positive note.  like suggestions. The seeker feels anxious about the change in the situation. The friend of the seeker or the supporter is asking about her own problems. If you know the person, you can tell them to talk to the person.	labels:Sounds good. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?
text:not right now but thanks for your concern. The seeker feels depressed and worried about losing his job. Most of the support groups provided by NAMI are not suitable for the seeker and his situation.	labels:Alright. You're welcome, it's what I'm here for. I hope you have a good rest of your day!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker feels uneasy about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the job is at risk of closure.	labels:Hello :)
text:This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as others? The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?
text:that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? The seeker feels insecure, confused and is unsure of what to do. The supporter could tell the seeker the co-workers are not getting the same results as the seeker. She could also tell the seeker that she has to be more creative to make the co-workers feel better.	labels:I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job. I am sure that with time you will get the same results as them if not better! Are there any co-workers you feel close to or see a friendship developing with?
text:that's nice of you to say but I also don't feel as organised. I suppose that's to be understood in a new job scenario.. Yes there are a few really nice co-workers. The seeker feels anxious as he looks for the right people for the job. The supporter could answer the seeker's questions and provide some help to the seeker. The seeker can be expected to have fun and be a good listener. The seeker should also ask the seeker for some background information.	labels:Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started..
text:I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to? The seeker feels stressed by the news from Nashville. The supporter can tell the seeker what the seeker is feeling. If the seeker is feeling stressed, she can tell the seeker the reason the seeker is stressed is because she feels scared. If the seeker is feeling depressed, she can tell the seeker that she is worried about losing her job. The seeker could also tell the seeker that she is worried about losing her job	labels:That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
text:I suppose it's difficult to know when something is too much for you or if you need to give it more time.. The seeker feels frustrated. He feels frustrated with his job and the situation he is in. The seeker may feel that he feels left out in the world and needs to do more.	labels:I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.
text:Thankshe problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks. The seeker feels frustrated with his work and in that moment he wants more. The supporter can share some of their experiences. The seeker is looking for a way to get paid.	labels:I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
text:Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself? The seeker felt very stressed about giving up his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he really is afraid of losing his job.	labels:Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all..
text:Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me. The seeker felt great about the job. After a few months, the seeker feels great about the job. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is normal. The seeker could be able to say that it was normal.	labels:Of course you are not alone!
text:I think I'll give this a good few weeks and ask myself how I think I'm doing then go from there. Thanks for the chat and your suggestions. The seeker is afraid of dying. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I think that is a great idea I wish you luck! Remember no matter what you will find somewhere you belong!	episode_done:True
text:Hi. The seeker is worried about leaving his job. The supporter should ask the seeker to stay positive. The seeker should also ask about his future.	labels:hello, how are you?
text:Honestly I'm not doing too great. hbu. The seeker feels anxious about what he is going to do. The supporter might ask about the need to be more active in the community.	labels:I'm doing ok, Is there anything you would like to chat about?
text:Yeah my long time partner cheated on me recently and I just found out. I havent been able to see them in awhile because of lock down and now they tell me this :( The seeker notices a young woman in the middle of the road who is pregnant. She is very tired, and is looking for a place to go. The seeker can tell that the woman has been to her house and was given some food. He can also tell that the woman is pregnant and is looking for a new place to stay.	labels:That is horrible I am so sorry they done that to you.
text:thanks. its just been such a hard couple of months because of the virus. And now with this I just dont know what to do. The seeker feels depressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that they have to stay positive and keep improving.	labels:I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is.
text:Yeah its an awful feeling and I just feel really sad. The seeker felt so happy and happy for the couple. The supporter could tell the seeker that the couple have a lot of hope because of their friend and support from their company.	labels:I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out.
text:I haven't spoken to anyone yet I dont want to bother anyone. The seeker feels anxious about getting married and getting a job. The supporter could tell the seeker the love life is tough. A seeker may want to think about getting married.	labels:don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.
text:Yeah I guess I should talk to someone about it. what else do you think I should do? The seeker is asking for more information. He has an amazing relationship with his partner.	labels:When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.
text:Yeah maybe I should try that. What else do you think would help? The seeker feels sad about his loss. The supporter could give a brief but positive answer to his question.	labels:letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again.
text:Yeah I definitely will not be going back to them. They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again. The seeker feels very depressed about his past. The supporter could tell the seeker he loves her very much and that will go away with him. In this conversation, the seeker feels very sad about the past. The supporter could also help the seeker to heal from his past.	labels:exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them.
text:yeah. thanks for sharing your experience with me. I feel a little better now :) The seeker felt happy and relaxed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is improving.	labels:you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you. you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you.
text:Thank you :) Thank you for spending the time to chat with me I hope you have a great day. The seeker feels sad about the loss of his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Anytime, I hope you have a great day as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker is feeling stressed. If you were to ask him that he would be more relaxed. The seeker could tell the seeker that he is happy now, but he is in a lot of pain.	labels:Hello.  How's it going?
text:I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions. The seeker feels scared. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions.	labels:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?
text:I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now. The seeker feels worried about leaving his job. The supporter could tell the seeker about the place he lives in.	labels:I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary! .
text:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation. The seeker felt worried about losing his job and he wanted to stay positive.	labels:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
text:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? The seeker feels like he is in a difficult position.	labels:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.
text:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself? The seeker feels depressed.	labels:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.
text:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this? The seeker feels depressed about his job.	labels:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
text:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also? The seeker feels anxious about the news. The supporter could tell about the news and some information about the family members.	labels:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?
text:I've never heard of this, what is it? The seeker felt depressed. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
text:I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free? The seeker felt like he was being "choked", but did not feel like he was being trapped. The supporter could tell that the person is being trapped. The seeker can tell that he is being treated a bit too well.	labels:Totally free!
text:I like the sound of that, thanks for your help. The seeker could tell the seeker that she is experiencing a significant emotional problem. It could also be that she is in a state of depression. The seeker would feel less or less depressed.	labels:You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.
text:thank you for the vote of confidence. The seeker does not know if the support group will work for the seeker.  Maybe even more importantly, they could offer some words of encouragement. 	labels:Very welcome!	episode_done:True
text:hello how are you today?\nHi there. I'm OK but have had a difficult time at work recently. The seeker feels angry at his job. The supporter could tell the seeker a job is not what it is.	labels:i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?
text:Yes I have been given what I can only describe as ridiculous feedback by my manager and it had annoyed me greatly. I'm thinking about complaining about it. The seeker feels afraid about working hard. The supporter could tell the seeker that he or she can't feel love.	labels:It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?
text:I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something? The seeker feels scared that he will lose his job and will have to go back to work.	labels:Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.
text:I'm thinking perhaps I should go to a different manager and voice these concerns. I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me. The seeker feels stressed and worried about being laid off from his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is so horrible he should be worried, or he should take a break from work and get some rest.	labels:Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.
text:yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future. The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me. The seeker felt scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Yes i can see where that would be a problem.
text:perhaps I'm just making too much of a big deal about this. how would you react if someone gave you similar feedback in work? The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?
text:I haven't actually thought about that as a solution but that might work actually. I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally. The seeker feels frustrated and depressed about not getting a job. The supporter could tell the seeker the only way to get a job is to quit.	labels:Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.
text:I think that's an interesting perspective. she might have issues herself and be taking them out on members of her team in work which is quite sad really. Do you think I should just be blunt and ask her the question? The seeker feels anxious about leaving his job. He is concerned about his own life, his job and what he is feeling.	labels:I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.
text:so be supportive but also make it clear that what she has said has had an impact on me? The seeker feels a sense of uncertainty. The supporter could tell the seeker the information she needs to make a decision about her job could be difficult. The seeker could say that the situation is not right so she needs to be more supportive.	labels:Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
text:ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice. The seeker feels scared about going to work. The supporter could tell the seeker the problem is there and the seeker would like to know more about it.	labels:In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.	episode_done:True
text:Hello :) The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The sponsor should share his thoughts about how to improve his life.	labels:Hello how are you doing today?
text:I'm doing well how bout yourself? The seeker feels anxious and worried about his job. The support should ask for more information.	labels:I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?
text:I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. I havent been doing as well since covid. and I'm kind of upset at my self for it. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker has been seeing a lot of other young women who are not in the same situation.	labels:Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.
text:Yeah the online schooling is tough for me. I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school. I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( The seeker feels lonely. He is feeling lonely.	labels:I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)
text:the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it. sure thing :) share. The seeker feels that it is really hard to be happy. He has been feeling this way for about three times now.	labels:Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.
text:You bring up a good point about changing environment. I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight. Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :) I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter should ask his fellow seeker about the different ways in which he is feeling depressed.	labels:Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :) You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around.
text:Yeah maybe I should do that. The seeker feels a bit depressed. He is worried about his work and how it is affecting him. The seeker might be able to relate to his girlfriend and tell her about his work.	labels:And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!
text:gotta switch things up. Yeah I should chat with my friends more too. Its hard to fine time but I should try. The seeker feels depressed and unsure about the future. The supporter could help him to know that at some point he will be moving to the living room and not be able to rest.	labels:It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)
text:very very true especially in these difficult times. Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap. and everythiung can go back to normal. The seeker looks at his surroundings.	labels:Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then.
text:Yeah thank you for your advice ill try implementing them in my life more. I feel much better now :) thank you for your time. The seeker feels uneasy. The supporter should explain why he feels uncomfortable.	labels:Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Are you there? The seeker knows the seeker is worried about the loss of his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:goodness  i am so sorry! my browser did not make a noise. how are you doing? sorry i kept you waiting!
text:That is okay! I'm glad you're here. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Awww, thanks. How are things going in your world today?
text:I'm doing alright I suppose, just trying to do a few mturk tasks to feel like I'm accomplishing something. Waiting to hear back from unemployment and not hearing back from any job applications makes it hard to ever really relax. The seeker felt depressed and scared. The supporter could tell the seeker that it's a pain to have to live with. The seeker could tell the seeker that it's something that she needs to deal with. The seeker could tell the seeker that the seeker needs her.	labels:Ah, i hear you. The lack of response makes it really easy for me to make up stories in my head and fear the worst.
text:I've never done any computer based jobs before, I did live audio and carpentry before this, so I just feel like I don't qualify for anything, but I'm immune compromised so until this is over i don't know what other work I can safely do besides for something from my computer.... I just feel so terribly stuck. The seeker felt scared for his life because he is a computer expert and he is very stressed out. He should find a way to stay calm.	labels:I'm sorry. I know the feeling of not knowing where I fit in. Its a whole world shift, too.
text:I haven't received any financial assistance from the government yet, I've been living off of loans from friends and what little of my art I've been able to sell. It's stressful. I just want my life back. I felt like I was on a really good career path at the first of the year, and now I just don't even know what o do. The seeker feels completely lost. The supporter could tell the seeker that things are tough, but it's just that they don't want to move forward, that they don't want to feel comfortable and they just want to go on with their life.	labels:That scattered feeling....trying to put the pieces back together....I've walked the same road this year. Would you be willing to mourn for what you had before? To let it go?
text:I don't want to. If there is a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 then the company I worked for before this will be able to go back to business, and I've been assured my old job back. I'm just in limbo right now, figuring out how to survive until then and keep from going crazy. The seeker felt overwhelmed by the news about his new contract. The supporter could tell the seeker that he was not ready for the new job, but the seeker could also tell the seeker that he was not sure what was going to happen.	labels:you have determination! There is fire within! Tell me, what brings you joy?
text:Music (that's why I was in the music industry before this haha) and art. I paint and do woodburning. I also love my cats, they spark a lot of joy. Thank you for chatting with me, and helping me earn the maximum bonus for this task! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day! Good luck in your own endeavors..

text:Perhaps you could tell me what brings you joy? The seeker felt sad. The supporter could be happy about not being able to live a happy life. The seeker could be sad about the life he had earlier in life but now feels he needs help.	labels:YES! for one, this mturk task is AMAZING  to me. Connection has been a huge boon for me this year. I thrive on helping others realize their strengths.

The supporter could share the same experience of losing his job because he is so afraid of losing it.	labels:Oh I see that was a very long relationship! I actually just got out of a 3 1/2 year one myself, so I understand how hard it is. Are you still currently staying with him until you find your own place? Or are you staying somewhere else?
text:I am currently trying to find a way to get to my mom who lives about 150 miles away. Im staying with my friend for now but she said I can only stay for 2 more days. Yeah break ups are the worst. The seeker feels scared of leaving his job, but he is still happy to be with friends and family.	labels:I'm glad to hear that you are with a friend right now during this hard time, and that you have a place to go! But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there.
text:Yeah she is a good friend im happy that I can stay with her for the time being its just stressful trying to get to my mom. The seeker feels scared for his or her life. The supporter could tell the seeker the the time is right for him to come back to the place he was when he was lonely.	labels:If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time.
text:Yeah I definitely agree. I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though. It does make me feel better to talk about it though and lay it all out it makes it easier to figure my stuff out. The seeker experienced anxiety about leaving his job and the family. The seeker is worried about whether he could ever get back to his job or have a family again.	labels:That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this. It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful.
text:Yeah thanks I appreciate that. I feel a lot better I hope you have an awesome day! I do understand what I need to do for sure. It was just overwhelming thinking about everything and talking it and listing it out makes me feel better for sure. The seeker feels depressed and in need of help.

What type of occupation are you in?
text:I'm studying to be a pharmacist. Really scared of getting sick too since I have to work in hosptials and such. The seeker feels scared about losing his job and how to secure the position. The supporter could also ask the seeker to be a role model and help them, such as making sure they can stay home without having to go to school.	labels:That's great! It is because of front-line workers and people like you that we are at least able to put a fight against the pandemic! My hat tip to you for choosing your line of profession. Major pharma companies have already announced vaccines and they have a success rate of more than 90 -95%. So my friend, this too shall pass..
text:Yeah  I've been reading those research articles recently they look promising. I'm hoping the vaccines get developed early next year and everything can go back to normal.

Modern technology is indistinguishable from magic!. So hang in there, with the US election results and the vaccine announcement, things will surely get better..
text:Yeah it's looking like things will improve. The seeker feels sad about losing his job and his experience. The supporter could tell the seeker the loss is real and he should keep on working on his skills.	labels:If you are in North America, the pandemic rate will go high due to combination with flu season, but at the end of the day, we will develop herd immunity.
text:Yeah not looking forward to flu season. I wish people would just stop throwing parties and getting everyone sick. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason for the stress is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to feel stressed.	labels:Well, nobody is, my friend! But it's part of life. And ya, morons will exist all over the world. Since you are young, even if you contract, you will recover pretty easily. But, God forbid, if you do, please practice social distancing and stay home!
text::( yeah they do don't they. Yeah i'll definitely keep my self isolated if im sick. im worried about all my  friends too because all of us will be out working in hospitals soon. The seeker sees an opportunity for an escape from his loneliness. The supporter should ask the seeker what to do and whether or not to stay home.	labels:I hope you don't get sick. Just follow what your supervisors advise you to and apply your own knowledge into practice. I am sure it will work out great for you and your friends! Friends make life worth living and I am sure you all will do great. Good luck!
text:thanks :) I'll try to take care of my self hopefully I end up helping a person or two. The seeker felt pressured by her employer to take her out of the work.

text:No I think this has been a very productive conversation thank you for your time :) The seeker feels a bit sad. The seeker thinks she has something to lose.

Take care :)	episode_done:True
text:Hey, how are you doing?\nNot the best, but I'm surviving. hello? The seeker feels scared. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:By surviving, it is more of a personal situation or an outside dilemma affecting you. is it*
text:I just haven't been able to find any work. I guess that is an outside dilemma, but being this behind on bills and feeling this helpless to change my situation has negatively impacted my mood. The seeker feels unsure and afraid of what is in store for him. The seeker could tell the seeker that for some reason he is being too pessimistic about his future.	labels:I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.
text:I have already been budgeting extensively, the issue is I can't make enough to cover my basic expenses, no matter how much I cut them. The seeker is scared of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Are you also pressed for time? Time management can be a predicament as well.
text:I have lots of free time, just waiting for unemployment to respond to my claims, applying for jobs online, and trying services like mturk to earn what I can from home in the meantime.. I spend a good portion of my day trying to apply for everything I can and fixating on mturk tasks to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something. The seeker expresses frustration at being unable to meet the money requirement for his job.	labels:Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. For someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes. I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.
text:I get to a point in my day where it feels like I've done everything I can for that day, and then I just have to try not to get too stir crazy. The seeker felt that the support could be important to him. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is a good person. The seeker could then use that support to give other people support, or to help.	labels:I feel that if you can focus on using your extra time as an investment into yourself (whether by reading, picking up a hobby, or working out), you can feel more accomplished and at ease with what you are doing in life.
text:I've been trying to look ahead, but this year has already set me back so much from my intended career path that it's frustrating. I just want my life back. That is good advice. I have been doing a lot more art during this time. The seeker felt depressed that he had to leave work. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has to stop living in the comfort of his home.	labels:Being progressive is difficult, but is one of the things in life which compound very easily. I believe many aspects in life are connected and that improving in some parts improves you as a whole.
text:Some days it's tempting to just do nothing and wait for it all to be over, but I feel better when I accomplish something for the day. The seeker feels stressed and stressed out. He feels stressed for not doing much to help him and feels stressed for not looking up his problems. He wants to know that his job is paying off.	labels:And if these "improvements" can also make you money/increase your worth/ease your mind, then that can be called a success. In my opinion atleast..
text:I wish someone was interested in buying my art! That would be a huge confidence boost. The seeker feels excited and sad about being alone again. The supporter could tell the seeker that they have found their passion for music and art, but it's not in the music that will help them. The supporter should tell the seeker that they are not alone and that they deserve to be with their loved ones.	labels:Yeah, but imagine how it would if you had days like that knowing it isn't a bad thing to relax. You have already put in the work in being comfortable before, allowing to enjoy your time however way you wanted. Looks like you already have an interest which can help you in many ways in life. That's really good.

When you are financially behind it feels like everything is just making it worse. thank you for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task! The seeker tries to stay positive. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing something for the day, and then try to stay positive.	labels:Yes, the tension and pressure only seems to mount on, but there will always be things like that in life. It is important to remember whether such problems are in your control or not. If they are, you know for sure that you can change how you are presently. No problem, this is a very interesting experience for me too.	episode_done:True

The seeker feels sad and scared. The supporter can tell how much the seeker has hurt her. If the seeker is afraid of losing his job the supporter can tell how much the seeker's job has hurt him.	labels:To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile.
text:But my family is away from me in another country. I can't even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying. The seeker feels depressed and scared. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:yeah I could understand your feelings right now.

text:Why are girls like this? The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I don't know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings.
text:I know, right! Should I move on or should I take revenge? The seeker feels very scared. The supporter could tell the seeker to stay hopeful and not look out for the seeker.	labels:I think the best way is to move on.
text:I feel like giving it back to her though! but I may get into trouble ... ya you are right! She is going downhill anyway. my friend just got fired and I actually got a much better job!

The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:revenge her with your success and positive attitude in front of she you need to much more happy.
text:Sure! You got it mate :) thanks for the support. Got a job and life in front of me. Bye now. The seeker feels angry about being cheated on. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:that's great!! happy beginning of new life.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, I have been feeling a bit down lately. My levels of stress and concern have been higher since the pandemic began. The seeker says he wants to stay optimistic. The supporter could tell that he wants to see his friends and family like he has a friend in the family.	labels:Sorry you have been feeling down. What are some strategies you have tried to help you cope?
text:Well, I have tried to get my mind off of it by activities at home. Spending time with my family. The seeker felt lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the the seeker is worried about the loss.	labels:Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.
text:Yes, but I still seem to struggle with feeling a bit more down than I'd like. Not sure what to do. The seeker feels less lonely but is worried about their job as well as their future. There are some strategies that could help the seeker.	labels:Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.
text:I have tried meditation before, but quite a bit back. Do you have any activities you could recommend, without risking my health? Maybe in my own home, so that I can social distance. The seeker feels insecure about the situation and is worrying about losing his job. The supporter could have information on how to cope with that stress.	labels:One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.
text:Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out. The seeker was worried about the loss of his job and his family. The supporter could tell the seeker that the loss of the job is so great, this is a great way to keep hope alive.	labels:Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same. It is harder nowadays with covid but there are many online groups. You could even start your own group!
text:Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too. Maybe I should block the ones that have mostly negative posts? The seeker feels like he has been told some bad news that he can't bear. The seeker tries to find a way to stop it and maybe find some comfort through writing a message to him.	labels:I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control.
text:I wished I had some more ideas on some fun, interesting or things to fill my time at home. I often feel I get in a bit of a rut with the same thing. Since we are home more now. The seeker says she was afraid to talk about the issue for fear of losing her job. I am not sure how many people who have this fear are able to get jobs.	labels:Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?
text:Well, I used to read quite a bit more, but I have slowed down on it. Maybe I should go and grab a few books. Thanks for the idea! The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with his boyfriend.	labels:You are quite welcome. I too find reading to be a most welcome escape. It takes one's mind off of day to day worries.

The supporter could tell the seeker that they are worried about losing their job.

Glad I could be helpful!
text:I will do that! Thanks again. The seeker said that he was tired and tired of his life. He was tired of sitting on his stomach and all of his life. He wanted to try to get out of his life and that was the only way to do it.	labels:You are welcome. I am glad I could help you find some ways to help manage stress levels. Is there anything else you want to talk about?	episode_done:True
text:Hi good afternoon, I am seeking support for my anxiety related to my job. Is this something you can help me with? The seeker feels anxious about losing his job.	labels:Hey there, please do share! I would love to help! Why is your job causing you to have anxiety?
text:Wonderful! My job is causing me some stress and anxiety. Everything is usually good except for my one coworker who tries to boss me around. She is very unhelpful and hypocritical. You cannot even talk to her without her interrupting or being rude. I am trying to find a better way to deal with the situation. The seeker feels nervous about becoming a good friend. The supporter could also tell the seeker to give up his job and get on with his life.	labels:I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?
text:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens. I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult. The seeker is worried about being called out and it seems like her fear of being called out is not working and she has to deal with it.	labels:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down. Since clearly this is affecting you at work and outside of it. Talking to HR should help.. What do you think?
text:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally. Our office is small so it would likely just be my boss who I have mentioned it to before. I think of it as she may not be working here that much longer. and is only part time now. The seeker felt stressed and anxious. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home. I also recommend finding ways to destress, listening to music, lightning candles or starting a series on netflix.
text:Thats true, it is good to put it in that perspective and to have another opinion on the subject. And think of another way to handle everything. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could say that the seeker is anxious and could be getting worried. The seeker would say that he will be fine and that he is in a good place. The seeker could also say that he is anxious and may be feeling depressed in some way. The seeker might say that he has been depressed, but he has not been as depressed as he has been in the past.	labels:Glad to help!
text:Thank you very much! The seeker finds that he has a problem with his co-worker. The supporter could tell him the co-worker has feelings of depression. The seeker could also tell that the co-worker is in the middle of a stressful situation.	labels:No problem, I hope enjoy the rest of your day!
text:Thank you and same to you. I appreciate your support! What do you do to unwind after a stressful day. The seeker felt like he was being held by another person. The supporter could tell him not to get off the job. The seeker would try to stop it, but would need help from an actual person.	labels:Personally, I spend time with family. Then I have a can of seltzer, watch something on netflix and unwind.
text:Netflix and seltzer have solved many of my problems. The seeker felt anxious about her work. The supporter could tell the seeker the work is hard, but it is not the same as being happy. The supporter might wish to try something new but in the end it is a difficult task.	labels:Haha it's a winning combination. Maybe a salty snack or something sweet depending how stressful the day was.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels anxious and worried. The supporter can tell the seeker that he has not been able to work.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:I'm not doing very well unfortunately. I failed my college finals, and now I'm up for Academic Probation. The seeker feels scared about losing his job.

text:I'm almost near gradution too. The seeker feels bad about not being able to get a job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the job is not up and he'd like to quit it.	labels:Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?
text:I learned yesterday. Because of the pandemic the semester is shorter. The seeker feels depressed about his life. The supporter could tell the seeker that you are looking at a long term solution. This is what they think.	labels:And how long do you have until graduation?
text:I should be graduating in June. The seeker gives the supporter a simple question.	labels:I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?
text:You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology. The seeker is worried about the fact that his current job is going to be shut down. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay proactive.	labels:Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?
text:Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \ The seeker is unsure if the seeker is still on probation. The seeker would like to know more about his or her legal status.	labels:Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.
text:That's great advice and likely would be my best option. I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it. The seeker feels scared. The supporter should also ask for more details.	labels:From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do.
text:Yes I am very stressed. I hate taking online courses and this pandemic is wearing me out. Plus I have a 2 year old son. The seeker feels anxious about how much money his earnings could be. The supporter will tell the seeker what they can expect in the future.	labels:You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!
text:Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker the fear of losing his job is unfounded and would make his decision based on his own decision making.	labels:And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once! Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?	episode_done:True
text:hello. The seeker 's feelings and feelings are very strong. The supporter would tell the seeker that he is happy and happy for them.	labels:Hi there.  How's it going?

text:Yes, it is especially hard because I live far away from all of my family and I am unable to visit with them. The seeker feels stressed and worried about being alone. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is different, but still a problem.	labels:Do you have any support in the area you live in?
text:No, I do not really have any support in the area I live. The seeker 's feeling hopeless and worried about ending up in the same situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that they should consider getting help, but would need another job.	labels:I'm glad you reached out.  Having support is something we all need.  Zoom and being far away isn't the ideal support I'm sure.
text:Yes, it's not ideal, but it is nice to have support even if it is over the phone, Zoom, etc.. The seeker feels scared of losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experiences and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:Most definitely.  I'm far away from my family too so Zoom and phone calls have been great despite the long distance.  Have you visited your family since Covid began?
text:I was able to visit them once over the Summer, which was great! The seeker felt isolated. The supporter could see the seeker and support him. However, the seeker also felt isolated on the outside. The supporter could see the seeker and support the seeker. The seeker could see the seeker and support the seeker.	labels:That's awesome!  I'm planning on going to visit mine next Summer.  Are you able to see them before years end?  If not, maybe early next year? Hopefully Covid will be just a memory.
text:I probably won't be able to visit them this year. But, hopefully things will calm down and I can visit them early next year some time! The seeker feels sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is a problem with her and that she won't be able to see them.	labels:What state do they live in?

The seeker should also share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:yeah that's a bad situation it seems.

text:Good afternoon, what can I help you with today? .\nHi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then. Sometimes at night, (and only at night) I get in these super depressive moods and have almost mental breakdowns about everything in my life. But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why. The seeker feels sad, but he can tell the supporter that he is experiencing a lot of negative emotions and has to take care of himself.	labels:That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. .
text:Yeah it is, and I'm not sure why it happens. The seeker feels anxious about not getting the job done. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is losing his job and not getting the job done.	labels:Especially when the sun starts going down sooner, it can seem like we have less time, and as if things are closing in upon us. .
text:Yeah exactly. Where I live, we just had daylight savings so it gets dark around 5:30 PM and it feels like my days are just wasted. The seeker es not feel at home as he felt it. The supporter could tell the seeker the situation is more difficult. The seeker could tell the seeker the situation is not how it should be and the seeker will have to deal with it.	labels:There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. . As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.
text:Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule. And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger. The seeker feels scared about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:That's an understandable fear. .

The supporter could share some information about how to break apart from the situation.	labels:Yes, BetterHelp is one of those I believe. TalkSpace is another one.

The seeker feels anxious about having to deal with the fact that he or she is not able to feel the same feelings as other people.	labels:It may be helpful!  As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. . The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you "need" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing. .
text:Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it. I never thought how that would help me though. I will totally do it more often when I am slumping. The seeker worried about being left out of the conversation. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are not alone and that they are not alone in this situation.

I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!" . There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now. . Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions.

The seeker stressed and worried about the issue of a job loss. The supporter could say that they have heard about the job loss and they are angry with me.	labels:Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.

He has the option of giving away his job at work to the supporter and the supporter could accept some help with the money.	labels:I know how you are feeling! It probably feels as if the world is crashing in all around you, You probably feel like you've wasted time you will never get back, and you are probably feeling just plain exhausted. While I can't say that I have ever been apart of a broken engagement. I can say I felt both Depressed and emotional and like my life was falling apart. I always tried focusing on the positives of the future.

The supporter could tell the seeker this is not the right time to break up with him.	labels:If there was a magical switch you would never know the good from the bad!

IF I were talking to my sister right now I would say "There are much better people out there for you, you will be much happier ending it now then after you are married!" I know it doesn't feel it now, but likely you will be in a much better place because of the break up now. Have you talked this out with your partner? Talking with them might help get you the closure you are aching for!
text:Thank you for your emotional support...I hope in time I will get better. The seeker still feels depressed. The supporter can share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I am Happy to help! I am sure you will start feeling better each day!

The supporter could tell the seeker the there is a problem and that the seeker is not accepting of the problem and needs to stop.	labels:It sounds like you're physically attracted to Doug and had a one-time encounter with him. Is that right? can you tell me more about how you're feeling now?
text:Well, actually this has been going on for 7 months. I hooked up with him after a month of talking. I'm ready to end this situation because I want the more emotional stuff I know Doug can't give. How do I get out? The seeker felt frightened and worried about losing his job. The supporter could tell the seeker that he can't get out of the situation.	labels:I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.
text:I heard of people falling for a fling or one night stand but this has gone on for months. Add to that, I see him at work. He's married and  I don't see this as more than a long term hook up. Have you ever experienced something like this? If you never experienced this do you know of anyone who has? What did they do to get out of this type of relationship if you want to call it that? The seeker feels lonely and worried about falling for a fling. The supporter could tell the seeker the fling is something they want to break up with.	labels:I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people. Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.
text:What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that? You keep saying it's good to reach out. I'm reaching out to you trying to find a way to turn off my emotions for this man. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are trying to find a way to hide their anxiety, which they may not find for themselves.	labels:Sometimes, a good first step is to reach out to friends who can help you fill your time and avoid interactions with him. And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?
text:My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more.+ Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go? I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean? The seeker is excited by Doug's support and he feels safe and happy with his life.	labels:I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife. You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?
text:I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem. The seeker feels a sense of vulnerability and he is starting to feel a little scared. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should be happy for him.	labels:You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.
text:All I want to know from you is to tell me how to get rid of the feelings I have for Doug or how to get rid of his wife since you think she's part of the problem? The seeker 's feelings of guilt and shame are all on display. The supporter can tell the seeker the feeling is that she has to go through the same thing.	labels:With the holidays coming up, maybe you could avoid him for an extended stretch and really do something about what it is you are looking for in a partner.
text:Like what? The media says stay inside with love ones. Doug is my love one. Wouldn't I be putting myself at risk of getting the conrovirus meeting someone new? The seeker feels sad about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and help the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty..
text:Why do you keep focusing on the wife? You make it sound if I just kill her Doug and I could be happy and I wouldn't have to worry about his Philandering as you call it anymore. Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? The seeker feels afraid about losing his wife. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.
text:You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it? Are you still with the man/woman or whatever that broke your heart and cheated on you? Why cant you get over it? Is the only advice for me you have is to eat Thanksgiving dinner alone? The seeker feels worried about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:I absolutely have had my heart broken, yes. And I've spent some holidays alone. I can understand your pain.
text:I'm glad you understand my pain. I've spent and know how to be by myself. What I'm asking you how do I get out being in love with someone? The seeker is not sure what to do. They need to find a good partner or a better one. In this situation, the seeker is feeling stressed and anxious and in need of help.	labels:It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not "the one." He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.
text:Okay so I eat Thanksgiving alone and I spend time alone. Okay tell me how i fill my nights alone up? How do I warm the other side of my bed which Doug fill so well. I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not! Also, I don't think being with Doug is settling! I do however appreciate your time and effort.. The seeker feels sad. He feels sad. He feels confused. He feels depressed. He feels angry. He feels sad. He feels lonely. I know I can help this person feel better. I know I can give him the comfort and support he needs. I don't need to give it to him.	labels:I regret my assumption.

What can you do to feel better?.
text:I can try to keep myself busy and practice self care. It is hard though because I still worry. Sometimes I feel too worried to do the things necessary to stop it all spiraling. The seeker felt very anxious and worried about him. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is too serious to be worried.	labels:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the "pause" of the pandemic. Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?
text:I have practiced breathing techniques and meditation before and think that is a great suggestion. At the moment I think the only thing that would ultimately really make me feel better is knowing my friend is okay. He already has health issues so it is a worry. The seeker felt a lot better about having been able to find a new job, get a new house and get a better job with his family.	labels:Absolutely, and it's completely understandable, but it's very hard to wait. I hope that you are able to practice some of the techniques we talked about, and seeking help by talking about it is part of self-care, too. I think you are on the right track to getting through this..
text:Thank you. That is nice of you to say and I appreciate the support. Just knowing someone has faith that I can do it gives me more confidence.

The sponsor could tell the seeker that he can help the seeker by talking to him after meeting the seeker.	labels:I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable.  I worked there for three years, but I was burning out hardcore.  She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.
text:yup.. i have 3 kids and i am not married. i have no beneftits. The seeker feels more optimistic about his job. The supporter could give a different perspective.	labels:She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits.  Eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than I was receiving from them.  I ended up leaving and going back to school.

text:its tough but i am on the honor role. you should go b ack to school. The seeker feels anxious about losing his job. The supporter could share some similar experience and suggest the seeker to stay positive.	labels:That's excellent.  I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on.  I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews.  You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids.  I would be surprised if he did not understand that.. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on..
text:with us both being veterans it goes beyond a boss relationship hes like family. i feel like id be fucking over the whole nation turning my back on another veteran.

The seeker feels bored and is not sure what to do. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:That's good. at least you found ways to get out of the anxiety.. and social media can cause anxiety too, so staying from your phone also helps :)
text:Well it is not helping much. But I guess it will get better over time. I suppose the second I start to feel better, he'll call. haha. It always works that way, right? The seeker felt nervous. However, he could still communicate something about the situation and could also have a conversation with the seeker.	labels:Yeah. given enough time and when things cool off, people do dwell on their behaviour and often times feel stupid for the way they act. i hope its the same case with your boyfriend as well. I have a feeling he is going to give you a call soon.
text:Thank you very much. I really hope so! :) The seeker feels scared, but the reason for that is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:you bet :).
