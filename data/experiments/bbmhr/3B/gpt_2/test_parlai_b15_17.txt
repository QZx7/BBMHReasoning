The seeker is worried about breaking up with her boyfriend because she does not want to do that.

(in seperate floors of the house) That was two weeks ago. So, yes, he is. Too soon to tell. The seeker could tell the seeker that she is not taking care of herself. She could also tell the seeker that she is being bullied for having not made enough money to support herself.	labels:I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here.

text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\nHi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better.

The seeker should ask if there is anything she could do to help the seeker out.	labels:So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?
text:Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is that the seeker feels lonely and scared. The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved. The supporter should move her to a safe place, calm her down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her	labels:I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?
text:I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about being alone. The supporter should send a message to the seeker that there are people around her.	labels:Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.
text:Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. The seeker tries to keep in touch with her freinds. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should be able to connect with her freinds. They should be able to talk about what she has been through with her freinds.	labels:Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
text:Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.
text:Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. The seeker feels isolated and isolated. The reason is that the seeker feels alone. The supporter should look into the matter.	labels:Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *
text:I have 6 classes. The seeker feels strong and confident. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask if there are people around her that will help her.	labels:That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart..
text:Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you! Have a great day and thanks again. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today? Hello? Anyone there?\nHi sorry. I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker that she needs to be present and feel she can help.	labels:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?
text:In about a month. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is that the seeker fears breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should be at ease with the seeker, and let the seeker know that she's doing everything right.	labels:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.. Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?
text:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter should ask for help.	labels:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.
text:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper. The seeker feels lonely and worries. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm her down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.
text:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research. The seeker felt lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that. You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.. That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable..
text:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused. The seeker feels lonely and worrying. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should make a list of things she wants to do, and ask for more details, like how she feels about becoming a mom.	labels:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.
text:My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable. The seeker has her feelings and advice from the seeker. The seeker is curious about the reasons people are so lonely. The seeker is in love with her friends.	labels:Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!.
text:I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should start a group call with the seeker to find out how she feels and how that can be helped.	labels:It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!
text:That sounds like a wonderful feeling. But so far away. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards..
text:That's a very poetic way of putting it. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at..
text:I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help. The seeker feels stressed. The seeker worries about feeling stressed. The supporter should also ask for more details.	labels:I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success..

The supporter should help the seeker be at ease and find out if there is anything she can do to help.	labels:yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us.

text:Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online.

I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. The seeker feels discouraged and discouraged. The supporter should call for more information.	labels:Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better.

The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.

It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent..
text:So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? The seeker feels that she has a strong opinion about this and that she should not associate with her current friends.
