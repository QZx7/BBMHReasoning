Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions.

I hate that but will do it.\ The seeker felt very lonely and scared. The reason is that the seeker fears losing her friends.	labels:I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts.

Society tells us we should be able to express our boundaries. Not everyone is comfortable with that and that is ok.
text:we literally just talked about it an hour ago. she says she doesnt know what she wants and she doesnt know how long but she doesnt want to be away from me right now. which i feel just isnt fair. i feel like no one can just pick and choose when they want someone around.

Sounds like you have coping skills for that.

I was with someone who, although we had great fun together, he couldn't be with me as much as I wanted him to. And it made me feel bad. Because it brought up feelings from when I was growing up and neglected. It took a long time, and it ...wasn't a clean break. I just got tired of feeling bad, and the relationship just waned.. Take the time you need, but you can take control, if you want to.

text:My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?

The supporter should tell the seeker that she needs to do something to make sure her new job will be worth it.	labels:That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.

The support should be directed to the support team.	labels:That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background..

I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but  their values are not walked out. I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a "start today" option.

The supporter should talk about how to find her new friend.	labels:shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing.

I have a few minutes left to talk if there's anything else on your mind?. How is life treating you otherwise?.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\nHi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter would like to help the seeker.	labels:So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?
text:Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?
text:I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot. The seeker and the supporter continue to talk.	labels:Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.
text:Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. The seeker feels stressed and nervous. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
text:Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. The seeker is worried about the emotions she has felt. The reason is that the seeker may feel stressed out. The supporter should ask for more detail.<|endoftext|>	labels:Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.
text:Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. The seeker your career. If you want to be a teacher,	labels:Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *
text:Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you! Have a great day and thanks again. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today? Hello? Anyone there?\nHi sorry. I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?
text:In about a month. The seeker was on the receiving end of a lot of requests. The supporter was on the receiving end of a lot of requests. The seeker was on the receiving end of a lot of requests. The seeker was on the receiving end of a lot of requests. The seeker was on the receiving end of a lot	labels:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.. Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?
text:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her. The seeker feels that she is being held accountable because she has a lot of self-esteem issues. The seeker feels that she is being held responsible because she has a lot of self-esteem issues. The supporter should stop doing things she wants to do and say this is not her time to be doing it.	labels:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.
text:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper. The seeker feels tired and frustrated. The reason is that the seeker feels tired and frustrated. The supporter should reassure the seeker that they are not tired.	labels:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.
text:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research. The seeker is busy, so she needs to be in a positive mood. The reason is that the seeker is looking for support. The supporter can tell the seeker that there are people around her that support her. People like to be in support of her and her goals. The seeker can also tell her that there	labels:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that. You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.. That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable..
text:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused. The seeker has worked hard on her goal. The supporter gets to say "I'm done with work."	labels:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.
text:I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success.. You are very welcome. Have a blessed evening!!.	episode_done:True

text:Well I met him on a dating site and he lives in France but he is also turkish i dont know much about turkish men but he says he loves me and he sees something with me but i barely know we only talking for few weeks now. The seeker is nervous and worried. The reason is that the seeker is not sure what to do. Also, the seeker is not sure what to do in this situation. You must be aware that one person can be so much more than another and this is something that has to be made easy on you.	labels:Well, I would recommend not taking things too quickly but relationships online CAN work - I met my fiance of ten years online..
text:oh that is wonderful. The seeker feels lonely and afraid. The reason is she feels isolated and lonely. This is the reason why she is not talking to her friend because she can't find one from the dating site.	labels:But we did take it very slowly and talked for a year before we met in person..
text:i told him i dont want to rush things he fine with taking things slow but he does want me to take a chance with him. im 23 and he is 27 he is a positive sweet guy currently he is battling covid. The seeker is so stressed and scared. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker that she is so worried about leaving her boyfriend.

Where do you live, do you mind me asking?.
text:I live in America and he live in France. The seeker is worried about her feelings but keeps her head down. The supporter will ask for more details.	labels:Ah well definitely do not contemplate meeting him whilst the pandemic is on! But it might be  good excuse to put things off for a bit, do you think?.

The supporter should give the seeker a chance to spend time with her kids.	labels:Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had.

The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should explain to the seeker why she is lonely and explain to the seeker why she is lonely.	labels:I can understand the pain you must feel and the betrayal, that is absolutely awful.
text:I do.  I don't understand why he was fine with my kids for almost a  year and all of a sudden it changed.  I'm completely blindsided. The seeker feels a little sad about the break up.

text:I'm not really sure how to break it to them when I do finally tell them. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do. Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings.

The supporter should give the seeker some words of help.	labels:They should hopefully be young enough not to want details.

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker she needs to calm her feelings. The seeker needs to stop playing the game of the heart and start giving up.	labels:I have a daughter and we have went through something similar in the past so I can relate.

So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?

The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.
text:Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.

The seeker is worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should help her resolve the problem and tell the seeker she is not alone.	labels:Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal.

And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat?
text:I talked about it with one friend. He felt bad but what I couldn't understand why he was secretive about the chat too. If he thought we were close why hide stuff? The seeker felt like she had to make her own plan. I don't know how to deal with this but I know I'd be happier if she wouldn't hide things.	labels:Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already.

The supporter should ask if she can talk about her thoughts and feelings. She should ask for more details.	labels:On the contrary, I think you might not be allowing yourself to ask enough! Sometimes, the people who are closest to us can actually become even more anxious about how something might affect your feelings. It could be the case with him too.
text:Sometimes I question if it is even worth talking to them about it. People often don't want to say what they really think. Instead they just say whatever to avoid confrontation.. The seeker feels a bit anxious.	labels:Some people express themselves best through their actions. Have you tried suggesting a meeting for something you'd usually do to see if they're willing to hang out just as always?	episode_done:True

The supporter should not tell the seeker what she is feeling. It is important to know the seeker, if not the seeker herself.	labels:I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?
text:I tried exercise to see if that would help.  It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The reason is that the seeker worries about the pressure of being in a virtual classroom. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again. Or take a quick break and get some fresh air? Is there anything else that you do in any other situation that would normally help you relax?
text:I could try deep breathing. Fresh air is hard because we're in the middle of a snow storm! I like to go to a spa when I'm really stressed. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!
text:I will try the deep breathing more often. . The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Maybe you could reward yourself with a spa trip ever so often, since you enjoy it?.
text:That's a good idea.  Maybe I could make it a reward for a good grade on a test. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!
text:I think it might too! The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should remind the seeker that there are people around her that are struggling and that is why they want to help.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!	episode_done:True

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it..
text:I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. The seeker does not feel alone and feels like a friend. The seeker is not a stranger. She feels accepted and is not afraid of strangers. The supporter is not afraid of strangers. She feels comfortable with the person she is with.	labels:yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?.
text:Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.
text:Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. The seeker and the supporter ask for more information. They may be unsure how to communicate with each other, or they may not have a comfortable way of communicating. The seeker will probably ask for their own personal information.	labels:Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing..

The seeker felt overwhelmed by the amount of stress.	labels:My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent..
text:So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? The seeker feels isolated.	labels:I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so.
text:Ah, something more casual? The seeker feels anxious. She feels that she needs to work harder. She feels that it is time for people to move on. She feels that she needs to work on her own. It is a bit hard to do when the situation is so bad and she is so stressed and stressed she is unable to work	labels:Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
text:That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually! The seeker felt very relaxed. The reason for this relaxation is that she felt like she was going to be able to stay and get her work done.	labels:Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale..
text:Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season! The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays..	episode_done:True

text:It is very difficult to stay home doing nothing, it is very upsetting. I have started to paint which I have always enjoyed doing but again when I see others close me work and settled it makes me feel sad that I don't have a job. The seeker feels happy and very comfortable with herself. The seeker needs to be open to sharing with her family and friends what she has found out. The seeker's own family and friends need to know and understand what she has found out and to support her.	labels:I think painting more would be very helpful!

That is what i would do.
text:Yea, I guess so. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is that the seeker worries about getting frustrated at work.	labels:I honestly do not think she will get mad just try to talk to her. I would just let it go because to me it's not worth being mad over for a long time you have to just let it go.
text:I think I will. I guess i'm worried because I had already expressed my concern with having multiple people on PTO and she specifically said, "it's okay because I can help cover".

text:I am feeling depression right now. The seeker feels depressed and anxious. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it.. I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want.. One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well.
text:I am really afraid here I don't know what to do. The seeker 's fears are satisfied. The supporter is happy. The seeker is not depressed. The seeker is happy. The seeker is not scared. The seeker is not afraid. This is the same seeker. I am the same seeker.	labels:As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals.. It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong.
text:I don't like the noise of ambulance at all any time I see one I don't feel happy. The seeker is not feeling happy. The organizer is not feeling happy. The seeker is feeling angry. The seeker is feeling stressed. The seeker feels unhappy. The seeker is feeling lonely. To put it in the context of the many pandemic outbreaks that have occurred in our area, the seeker is feeling as if	labels:I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you.. One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>. Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive.

The seeker is looking at a new boyfriend in her life.	labels:That is a defeatist way to talk! Just because a couple of relationships fail does not mean that you will never be able to find happiness..

The reason is that the seeker feels sad. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker that the situation is a little bit better now.	labels:I hear you on that one too! It's horrible to feel that you are losing your self respect but I suspect that we've all done it at some point. Have you considered getting some counselling?.
text:Sigh.. yes. I have seen several. I also take meds from a psychiatrist. The seeker tries to relate. The supporter should be there to help her cope, to help her understand the situation.	labels:I hear  you saying that they are not really effective, is that true?.
text:Well... one told me that I should be put down like a dog to my face. so, yea. The seeker feels frustrated and lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Okay .. I hope you reported him!!.
text:I didn't. I was younger then. who knows. not gonna lie. maybe they're right. Sometimes I think I'm a psycho. My last therapist was always doing deep breathing exercises. It didn't help. I also have a lot of anxiety. A LOT! I even got an emotiona support dog. The seeker feels anxious. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it.

I can't even imagine how happy I would be if i was going to live with a dog.	labels:I think you are probably not anywhere near as bad as you think you are you know :).

The seeker should explain what to do.	labels:I have been feeling a little low too. Would you like to tell me a bit about why you are disgusted with yourself?.
text:well, i'm not disgusted with myself... it's just people in general. everybody.. they're so selfish. any they all care about superifical things. The seeker does feel like it's the people around her. The support should also help the seeker feel like she is being loved.	labels:Ah yes, this has been especially obvious during the pandemic hasn't it? Too many people not following the social distancing rules.
text:well, you could say that. take christmas, for example. people give everyone else gifts out of obligation. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is lack of interest.	labels:Do you feel that the pandemic has made you feel worse? Or have you felt like this for a long time?.
text:a long time. more as i age. i'm actually tired about hearing about the pandemic, really. it is all people ever talk about. more people are probably dying of obesity. eating themselves to death. The seeker feels happy and relaxed. The reason is simply that she already knows the situation.	labels:Well, it is a pretty significant issue this year :). Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?.
text:I think it would be beating a dead horse. Ober half the population is overweight. People would just need to be blind not to see it. That's kind of my point. Everything is consume... consume.. consume.... buy buy buy. The seeker was talking about how she would like to raise awareness about the pandemic. She said she would be more willing if she could get some help from other people. She said she would start having weight loss exercises and try to eat more.	labels:So you feel as though there is no bright side - that everything is just artificial and superficial?.
text:well... you can't really do anything without money. it all kind of rides on it, doesn't it?  what you can buy?

The supporter should also ask for that person's name.	labels:I don't mean to sound twee but there are things out there in life that can be appreciated for free :).
text:Yea, a few things here and there. Nature, let's say. But nature doesn't really give one way or another about you. My friends have a lot of money, though, and none of them are even happy. thats even more saddening. The seeker feels like her boyfriend is doing something wrong. But she is really afraid about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should explain the reasons why.	labels:I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!.
text:Yea, I know, right. I have one friends who has probably about 100k in the bank, and he will complain if he spent 4 cents too much on gas over another gas station. The seeker feels sad, confused and overwhelmed with sadness. The seeker feels like this is really no help either. The seeker feels like she is trying to understand the world around her.	labels:People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them..
text:yea, it's hard, though, because sooner or later it comes out in almost everyone i meet. who knows. maybe even i do it and don't even know it. thats scary, you know. at least your honest. The seeker feels discouraged. The supporter should tell the seeker that they will feel discouraged.	labels:Well, the fact that you can reflect on it indicates to me that you are probably not guilty. Most of those who do this are totally unaware.. It has been really nice chatting to you and I hope that things go your way in 2021. You seem like  good person :).
text:Thanks. Probably true. sometimes when i bring it up they'll just argue about it and defend themselves. i just try to move on but it is always there. ok. yea it is 15 minutes so bye bye. good talking. The seeker I don't know, but I am a big supporter for people like you.	labels:you too :). you need to finish from your end .. I can't :).	episode_done:True

I am sure that with the right strategies you will overcome any obstacles, though. Could you tell me what the issue is in particular?
text:It's just a huge amount of work that I'm struggling with and a ton of exams and they give me a lot of anxiety. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The reason is the seeker is afraid of the emotional stress of her boyfriend. The support should give the seeker time to relax and be relaxed.	labels:It is perfectly fine to feel stressful whenever an important assessment is coming. Make sure that you try to be as prepared as you can. When you feel capable of doing well on said exams, you will feel a lot less pressure.
text:Do you have any recommendations on reducing the stress though? The seeker is not satisfied with the results. The reason is that the seeker is not confident enough. The support has to be in the form of a positive comment on the seeker's work.	labels:Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?
text:yes it's all virtual though. The seeker is very stressed. The reason is that the seeker worries about being stressed.

text:I see, and how were you able to maintain a healthy lifestyle with enough sleep and healthy eating habits during college? The seeker is planning to be at 3:45am or 4:45am and she feels stressed. The supporter should ask her about how she feels about her mood.	labels:I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier. I usually slept around 7 hours each night. I picked most of my classes on the afternoon, worked out in the mornings.
text:okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down? The seeker felt depressed. It is not a problem that can be overcome through the right strategy.	labels:I would suggest talking to the professor or an academic advisor to explore strategies that could help you improve.
text:okay but is it normal to be upset? The seeker feels upset. The reason is that the seeker is upset.	labels:Of course, it is normal to feel upset. However, you should not blame yourself. No one is perfect.
text:Okay that makes me feel better. The seeker feels upset about her situation. The reason is that the seeker has been getting a lot of bad feedback in school. The reason is because they have been judging and judging her.	labels:I am glad it does :D! Anything else I can help you with today?
text:that's it! thank you for your help. The seeker feels sad and worried. The psychologist looks at the seeker and says, "I want to be able to find a way to break up with my boyfriend and make her feel more than just a problem."

The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I am sorry if your partner is cheating. So, your partner denies the charge of cheating? Are you and your partner married?
text:Yes. He says the person who told me is lying.. We are not married but we live together.. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker to be more careful in the future.	labels:How long have you been in a relationship with your man?
text:2 years. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker if she could help with her worries.	labels:So, 2 years should be long enough to know if your partner has been cheating.
text:What do you mean exactly? The seeker asks.	labels:Are you someone who trusts people? I think that most men would fess up about it.
text:I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Does he show affection to you? If he is adamant about loving you, then, it may be false allegations.
text:That is true. He is but, has been distant lately.. The seeker feels unkind towards her partner. She finds herself feeling lonely. The reason is you.	labels:I have had coworkers lie and be jealous that I have a good relationship with my partner.
text:Do you think maybe it was a rumor started by someone who could be jealous? The seeker feels anxious and worry. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker the rumors are false.	labels:Ash your partner if he loves you enough to propose marriage. If he says no, then ask him why.
text:That is a good point. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about not being able to be with her boyfriend and her fiance. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.
text:I  am not sure if I am okay with giving him an ultimatum. We are still young and although I love being in a relationship, I am unsure about marriage.. But I appreciate your suggestions. and you make a great point about the workplace being hostile. The seeker feels angry about the rejection from her partner. The supporter should ask the seeker what is wrong with her and ask if it can be fixed.	labels:Sure, I understand.
text:I should trust my partner more than any random person.. The seeker is concerned about the possibility of cheating on her boyfriend. The reason is that she fears he will cheat on her.	labels:Yes, the workplace is not like home life. . Yes, trust matters.
text:But every time i bring it up, he tries to change the subject. How should I approach him to communicate better? The seeker thinks he is being insulted by an employee. The supporter should ask his partner to stop. The seeker should make sure he is not being insulted by somebody.	labels:I would see if he wants to spend time doing things like volunteering after work.

The supporter should ask if she can help the seeker with any other problems.	labels:Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship. Yes, ask him if he wants to learn to swing dance or take skiing lessons or volunteer for Habitat for Humanity.
text:That is a good point. It is just hard to go on with the relationship when I feel I do not know the whole truth and there is little discussion or reassurance.. The seeker I am not. I am a guy who enjoys every minute of it and I am a guy who has always wanted to be with you.	labels:You have done your part, but if he wants to show you affection on a regular basis, that is a good sign. How old are the both of you?

The supporter should tell the seeker that the situation is serious and that they should speak to an experienced counsellor.	labels:I know its tough especially with the holidays and all. You have so many great skills and are such a hard worker I dont think you will have a problem at all finding something different..
text:I've been looking at other companies, but learning a new system after all these years is difficult. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned.

text:That's true. I've thought about looking into new fields. The seeker feels very lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you looked into some evening classes or maybe online schooling? I hear there are so many different options when it comes to online learning.
text:I was looking into that last night, but with covid,  classes have had to cut enrollment and are already full for next semester. The seeker 's concerns are raised. The supporter's concern is that the seeker may lose her job if she doesn't get the help she needs.	labels:They are full? well what about surrounding towns? Have you sat down and really thought about your passions and what you enjoy doing? Maybe theres an elderly person who needs some companionship or something like that in town for the time being.

text:I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love.

It just feels robotic now.. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling. However, it's not the end of the world.

The idea that we are over-reliant on technology to manage our lives is really just a lie. The seeker can't help but feel more of a burden as we are now in a world of information and information culture.	labels:I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you.
text:I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is it's a negative situation for her as the situation with the other person might be the only reason she would rather take a break from her life. The seeker needs to be less of a "good" person.	labels:It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly.

text:Yes. The seeker feels that the seeker has a bad memory and the supporter is not able to help. The seeker needs to look for a friend.	labels:I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings. Hearing you tell me that he has done this is upsetting to me as well.

So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument? Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past? Are you still there? Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond? I would really like to help you find a solution to this problem, but it appears as though you may not be active anymore. I'm going to wait a few more minute for you to respond before cancelling the chat. In the event that I don't hear back from you, I wish you the best!	episode_done:True

Similarly, you will also regain your confidence and social status as you interact with society more.

The reason for being abused by their boyfriend was that she was emotionally abused by them.	labels:It will soon be over hopefully. Hey, just try to focus on improving yourself as a person. Try to find an activity you enjoy doing. Keep exercising, that's great for your body and mind. And definetely talk to any closed one you have if you need to.

text:Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic. The seeker elt lonely and scared. The supporter should calm down the seeker.	labels:It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy.

I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too. Because you have options, you will likely pick the choice that will be most fulfilling for you, in something you will be passionate about - so this will likely be very positive for you..

It's not always beneficial to compare yourself to others. Are you having issues with focusing?
text:I think so? I think it is just the way the material is taught now. We have these "Zoom" sessions where everything is taught online, but it just all feels so impersonal. We are expected to read things on our own and then come to class ready to do these activities. I just prefer the old style of attending classes, having someone teach me the material, and then going back and studying on my own. I think it is also the social aspect of this pandemic too. I haven't seen my firends in person in a very long time. I'm worried that if my poor performance continues, then I might loose my scholarship. The seeker feels stressed and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:What happened when you reached out to the teacher?

To this seeker, it makes her feel that there are people around her who can help, but it seems like they're not all good.	labels:I think if you could teach yourself, the class wouldn't exist. Does your class have a study group? Usually schools offer free tutoring, because students volunteer to do it for credits toward a teaching degree. have you heard of that? There is always a way. You have to be smart to get a scholarship. You deserve to be in that class as much as anyone else.
text:I have tried the group study sessions, but I feel like I don't retain as much. I just get very discouraged when I see how smart everyone else in my class is. I don't know if my school offers free tutoring now. They used to, but I am not sure if they are still offering it due to the pandemic. I'll try that though. It might help to get one on one attention from a past student who did well. The seeker feels stressed. The leader should be working on the next book and trying to be more of a teacher, and it's not good enough.	labels:Well, they most likely do it over zoom. But it's better because it's one on one.

She thinks that she can be the one to talk about it but never heard from her friends or loved ones.

Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation..

May I ask, how did you deal with your own birthday depression? Maybe I can learn from you. The seeker feels stuck. The supporter should ask for more information on how to deal with any anxiety or depression.	labels:As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  "normal people" and being "average" really mean.

The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yeah, I hear you. Are you talking to others -  such as professionals, etc. - about your autism?

text:hello, how're you? The seeker feels happy. There is no reason to worry about anything else.	labels:GOOD. What bring you here today.
text:I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk) The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that since COVID your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself?

The seeker feels alone and feels scared. The supporter should help the seeker feel alone.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to COVID and they are choosing to not? Is that correct?
text:Yes this is correct.. The seeker feels that she doesn't want to be alone anymore. The reason is that she started talking to her friends.	labels:Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time.  You should not feel bad about what you are doing.
text:Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Do you have any other friends besides this group?  Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?
text:I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out.. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:What hobbies or activities do you like to do?
text:I play field hockey so I train a lot in my basement (because I'm scared to go out to the gym), I listen to music, read, watch Christmas movies, and I love talking to people. Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time. It's just hard finding other friends right now in the times we're living in. The seeker l movies and eat lunch there. 	labels:Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!  That does sound like it would keep you busy.

The seeker feels isolated, isolated, isolated. The reason is that the seeker feels isolated, isolated, isolated.

text:i mean no one has specifically said anything to me that was negative, but suddenly i feel like people are avoiding me. we used to hang out in the living room all the time and we would eat these big meals, but yesterday i came home and they were all cooking with my ex. they said they made enough for me but it seemed like such an after thought. The seeker feels scared. The reason is that the seeker feels scared about breaking up with her boyfriend.

The reason is that the seeker worries about her boyfriend. The supporter should go to bed and give the seeker some help.	labels:Oh! I live in KY and it's 8 pm at night! lol Well, good afternoon to you!  A pleasure to meet you, how can I encourage you today?
text:I have no local close friends, they all live overseas. With the holiday season it gets lonely as there's no one in my city to celebrate Christmas with. The seeker is happy. So happy it feels good knowing that there are people around her. The reason is that there are people around her who are happy.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. I am in the same boat! We have no close friends and family near us, we moved here to a very rural area in KY some years ago, so I understand.. Do you live alone?
text:Yeah I do. The seeker is worried about her friends. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person..
text:How did you meet them online? The seeker was looking for a new person. she wanted to know if you would like to meet with her. The seeker wanted a new person to meet her on her own. she also wanted to ask you what you would like to do for her.	labels:On FB in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if I  could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so I just picked women..
text:I feel like I would struggle to establish a connection with someone over the phone. There are no restrictions in my city at the moment so I would really like to meet some people face to face. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I was just thinking of ideas for me to make local friends too. Perhaps you could invite people to your home for Christmas, then when they say they have something occurring, perhaps they will realize you are alone and then invite you?. Are there any churches feeding people on Christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.
text:Sadly most people here spend Christmas with their families and are quite private about not inviting outsiders. Last year I spent it with a friend but he is going to his family this year. I can find out about churches, I have no idea. The seeker is in love with her family who are always friendly and very kind. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the FB search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too..

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:There always seems to be people in the same boat I am in, it is just a matter of thinking outside the box and perhaps even calling friends and asking for suggestions. I will definitely say a prayer that you find some people to share a meal with..

The seeker has said that they are only interested in meeting people at the same time that they are looking for someone to talk to. The supporter has said that they want	labels:You are welcome.

The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around her that have a job or a job that they really like.	labels:Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse..
text:When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should help the seeker.	labels:So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?.

text:Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone. The seeker 's friend mentioned her friend's death. The seeker is trying to explain that she had talked about it with her friend when she was young. The seeker does not want to be associated with feelings of grief and sadness.	labels:I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?.
text:I have a brother, but his wife is really terrible, and they are very close. He and I text some, and I try to keep that up. He doesn't need me the way I need him... The seeker needs to talk about family.	labels:What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free.
text:Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video... The seeker feels depressed and depressed. The support should stay with the seeker until the seeker leaves the room.	labels:That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?.
text:The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization. The seeker would not want to talk to anyone because she needs to learn to be more accepting and accepting of others.	labels:Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have..
text:If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups... Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start? The seeker feels depressed and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?. I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you..
text:Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet. It's a hard time for making new connections. Thank you - best wishes to you, too!

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Has anyone else noticed him sleeping all the time at his desk?
text:My boss said (I have been there for five years) to me one day did I see DE sleeping at his desk? I was floored that it seemed he never saw him do it before.  How could he not? The seeker said "I am in love with you", "I have been dating you for a long time", and "I was always looking for a girlfriend".	labels:That is really weird how can someone not see him sleeping at his desk.
text:Very weird.  I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor.  Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping. The seeker sees DE sleeping in the middle of the night. The person who sleeps in the middle of the night may be a stranger. He may be the only person that does not know who he is. The seeker may even have the option to tell the seeker what he is doing.	labels:Have you talked to your co worker about it?
text:It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss.  He obviously said nothing. . The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should be very patient and clear with the seeker.	labels:if your boss said nothing to him then maybe you should step up and say something even though you are right that is not your place.
text:I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is because of the fear of meeting the seeker. The seeker is afraid to meet the seeker.	labels:Your boss does not sound like a good boss at all and not doing his job correctly.
text:Definitely not being fair across the board, in my eyes. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.<|endoftext|>	labels:i feel like you should have like a serious talk to your boss about it.
text:You're probably correct.  I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I don't want you feeling how you feeling because you are doing your job and you are doing everything you can to solve the problem.
text:Thank you, that helps hearing that from someone. . The seeker s very upset and she feels very sad. The support should be given to the seeker to talk to the support.	labels:How long has this been going on? Your welcome.
text:Seriously, over two years.  True. The seeker elt overwhelmed, angry, frustrated, lonely, scared, and angry.	labels:How many times have you confronted your boss about it?
text:I never have, I just looked at him like are you for real when he asked me if the guy was sleeping the one day.  I had to bite my tongue not to say, yes, and he does it every day! The seeker feels angry. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker that the seeker needs to go to the job office and talk to her supervisor.	labels:So he must not believe you.
text:Well thank you for letting me get this out.  I appreciate the advice and I will definitely think over talking with my boss.  Have a good night! The seeker s very happy. The supporter is very worried about the seeker. The seeker is happy to be with her. She is happy to have a good time with her husband.	labels:have a good night to and your welcome.	episode_done:True

text:That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?
text:Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late.. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.
text:I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so? The seeker is so stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should talk about how to get the support of her friends and family.	labels:Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life. It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.
text:I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start. The seeker is stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker should ask for more details.	labels:Start by talking about whats going on. Tell her how you think you guys should spend more time with her. Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.
text:I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that. The seeker feels frustrated. The reason is that the seeker is having difficulty finding love and her boyfriend is trying to force her into it.	labels:I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.
text:If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself. The seeker feels comfortable. The supporter should talk about the issues she has.	labels:Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.

The seeker feels depressed and is worried. The reason is that the seeker feels depressed and is worried. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her who are a good fit or a need for help.	labels:I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can.. If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it. I think it would be a great start.
text:Thank you very much for your response. You have been very helpful. Perhaps, one last question - my wife and I have been hiding our problems away from our teen-age son. Do you agree that we should continue to keep it from him? The seeker has already been talking about her problems with her boyfriend. She has had a very bad relationship with him. My wife was trying to get help from other members of her group. We were going to take her to a therapist that might be able to help me. I would not be happy for her.	labels:Depending on the nature, I think you should let him know whats going on. He may already know.

text:I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too... But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker worries about being lonely. The supporter should ask her to calm down, but the seeker should explain the reason why.	labels:I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?
text:We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical. The seeker wishes the supporter had been more compassionate.	labels:Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?
text:Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though. The seeker is not concerned about danger. She wants to help the seeker.	labels:That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?
text:Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?
text:Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say? The seeker feels overwhelmed.

It is not only that she is overwhelmed with thoughts of how to fix this, but it is that she is overwhelmed with the thought of how she would probably end up	labels:All of the above!
text:Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue. The seeker feels isolated and alone. The reason she's isolated is because she's so stressed. The supporter should provide a brief introduction to the seeker. She should make sure that she has a place to stay. The seeker should be able to find some time together. The seeker should feel safe and secure. The	labels:Do you think these issues are serious enough to get a proffessional involved?

text:I've thought about selling stuff online, but the cost of selling things online isn't really worth it. I've been trying to use facebook marketplace, but I never have anyone who's interested. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is she feels more depressed. The supporter should give her a hug.	labels:Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.
text:I've heard of QVC, but I've never heard of QVC liquidations. That might be something for me to consider. Can you give me more details about it? The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id.

text:I worked with someone whose boyfriend did that. I've never thought about doing that. I might have to consider doing that so I can feel more helpful to my husband. The seeker wants to know if she can find a seller that will help her make money. The advocate should ask for more detail and make you feel better about the seeker's situation.	labels:Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper.
text:I don't shop at Walmart very much so thank you for that information. The seeker feels depressed and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about the loss of a loved one. The supporter should be calm and tell the seeker that she should feel more comfortable with the loss of her loved one.	labels:I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.

text:Doing great. How about yourself? The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is because the seeker worries about the seeker hurting herself. The supporter should say everything to calm the seeker down.	labels:I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?
text:So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary.A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. The seeker feels shy and scared. The reason is that the seeker feels shy. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?
text:I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. The seeker says she feels safe in her home, and she can do it. In this conversation, the seeker says she can do anything. They say the seeker can do anything. The seeker can do anything. But the seeker feels scared. The supporter should be calm and say it to the seeker.	labels:I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?
text:It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I dont. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too. The seeker and supporter both felt that they would need to work to make sure their requests were met. Because I was trying to help people, I felt like I had to make sure they would respect my requests.	labels:I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?.
text:I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do. The seeker feels frustrated and worried. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?
text:Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part-time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions? The seeker was very excited about her new job. She was also very nervous about this topic and didn't understand why her job was in jeopardy.	labels:We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?
text:That sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I do get paid vacation. The seeker one of	labels:Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions.

The supporter should ask for details.	labels:My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went.

text:He hasn't hurt me physically. I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling..
text:I think that's the best idea. The seeker hopes that the emotional attachment will help. The supporter should ask for more details. In this conversation, the seeker wants to help the seeker. The supporter should think about the relationship.	labels:Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious..
text:that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend. The seeker feels relaxed and relaxed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet..
text:hey may not realize I'd leave at all. me too, that's making all the difference. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that..
text:definitely that makes sense. The seeker a good person for a while, but now you're being too abusive to help him.	labels:He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it..

Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application..

The supporter should go through the interview and ask the seeker if they can take some time to meet up.	labels:Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies  that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/weeks.

text:No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house.
text:Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one. The seeker feels that the seeker is being misunderstood. The seeker is being misunderstood. The seeker should have a better understanding of the person who is being misunderstood.	labels:I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks.

Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem.
text:Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently. Has your daily routine changed at all in the past month?

The supporter should explain that she and her boyfriend have been together all of their lives, but in the past month or so they have had to go to work because of the pandemic.	labels:are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines.
text:Yes its been surprising, I have talked to my doctor and he suggested I try to document my triggers so I will try to do that. Anyway I have to get going, You have been very helpful. Have a wonderful day! The seeker is a tough day out in Nashville but there is nothing that could have deterred the seeker from coming home. I am here to find a way to keep my mind out of the way. I am here to find a way to	labels:Glad to know my advice is worth something, afterall I am not a doctor. Nice speaking with you!	episode_done:True

How have you loved one dealt with it? The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:That's rough :/ I assist in managing some Airbnb properties and they've been hit so hard because of the pandemic. At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine. Honestly I had one friend who had been looking for a job for over a year and he just got an offer last month. They just kept persevering, even if that included applying to 30+ jobs each week.
text:That's good, at least I know there is light at the end of the tunnel. I was thinking at this stage of the game I might have to learn something new in order to get a job. Hopefully, the vaccine will help start to bring things back to normal. Did your friend find a job in the same field? The seeker talks to the supporter. The supporter will say:	labels:My friend works in tech (I don't know what exactly he does since it all goes over my head lol) but I know that he took a lesser position and smaller pay than he had before. He is trying to steer his career in a different direction so I do believe it will work out for him and for you :)

The seeker feels happy and well cared for. The seeker feels very relaxed and has a wonderful mood. The support has been great thanks to the support from the seeker, the supporter and the support of the other people around her.	labels:I hope you know that you have people who will encourage you every step of the way (even strangers :) )! This pandemic has been really rough but I have to keep reminding myself to count myself lucky for staying healthy. I hope you will be safe until the vaccine and after :) I believe in you!
text:I hope you do as well. Stay Healthy and be careful. Thank you again for your kind words. And 2021 will be better than 2020! . The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:Bye! I think you have to end the conversation on your end first..	episode_done:True

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Feelings of insufficiency can be such a stumbling block when looking for work. It is obvious that you are putting forth great effort.. Do you think getting in contact with a job agency in your area would be beneficial to you?
text:I have not contacted a job agency. I don't have experience with them. That is a good idea. The seeker feels like she is not being treated as a person. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The supporter should tell the seeker that she will not be able to make it through this journey.	labels:Perhaps there are a few agencies in your area to help and you can maximize your opportunities. You mentioned feeling down in the beginning of the conversation, would you like to talk about that?
text:Yes I am going to look. It will increase my chances of finding work. It doesn't help that I live with my parents and because I have no work I spend most of my time at home and get into arguments with them. The seeker felt nervous. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker fears getting into arguments with people. The seeker is fearful of taking things so far.	labels:Tension can be high when you already feel stressed about the job situation.

The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:That would be great! There may also be opportunities to help out online until we can be more free to move around safely.

The seeker should let her talk about her feelings.	labels:Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it. Take a few calming deep breaths and engage in self-care, you deserve it..

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment.

Can I encourage you or support you in some way?
text:Yes - definitely. I am not sure how to proceed or what to do in my situation. I am exhausted, mentally and physically.. The seeker is trying to make the seeker feel better. As the seeker has her eyes locked on the seeker, she wants to be part of this. She wants to be part of the seeker.	labels:You sound as if you are in a slump. I've been there. Perhaps defining the problem and some solutions can help?
text:Perhaps - i dont know the solution. the problem is I cannot continue to work these hours - it is just not sustainable.. The seeker feels unfulfilled. The reason is that the seeker doesn't want to work hard. The person is so busy with her job that she feels like an exhausting burden. The seeker needs to be able to concentrate on the things she enjoys.	labels:What are your hours?
text:like generally, or currently in these situations? usually its around 9-5 (give or take).  These days its 9 - 7 or 11pm or later.. The seeker feels stressed and depressed and lonely. The reason is that the seeker is not feeling much. The rejection is being directed at her boyfriend.	labels:I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily..
text:right, and that is the issue of where I am at.. The seeker feels overwhelmed. I am not sure what to do. I am tired, I feel like I am in a slump, I am completely exhausted, I feel like my heart is pounding..	labels:9 to 11 would exhaust me. That is 14 hours?.

The reason is that the seeker believes that she is not alone in this situation. The seeker does not feel that she is alone.	labels:I would certainly agree with you.

The seeker feels depressed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries..
text:agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.. The seeker was looking for a solution to her problem. She felt stressed. The supporter felt stressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker felt depressed. The seeker	labels:Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.
text:Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am. The seeker is having a hard time with the idea of keeping up the fight. The supporter is doing her best to reassure the seeker that by trying to get through the night, she has not left her boyfriend, but that she will be able to do it at least once in a while.	labels:I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you. Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot..

Family arguments are unfortunately very common so try not to worry too much about it. Do you really need to keep this person in your life though? If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?.
text:Because I live in the same area as my parents and any get togethers we have I don't even want to go to so I don't have to see her and she has used that opportunity to turn anyone she can against me, I cut off contact back then too... The seeker feels stressed, concerned and worried. The reason is not mentioned.

If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I've had this happen. Sitting around sulking about it is only going to delay things in your life.

She knows that she is loved and loves her husband. The supporter should be a part of the message.	labels:What is your age?
text:I am 25 at the moment. The seeker is at a loss for what to say. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well..

She is very upset that I don't know she was in love with me, and she feels that she has no way of knowing for sure. The reason is that she has no idea what to do with me	labels:Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?
text:Actually, In the past few months she has kinda freaked out everytime I tried to get her phone for her. As if she didn't want me to see something. The seeker feels lonely and tired. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me.

The seeker is not happy with the way things are going. You would think she would be happy to get some kind of closure from this person. But the moment she saw the seeker's heart breaking in her eyes, she just couldn't believe it.	labels:I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn't get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.
text:You are right. I need to take this slowly and calmly. The seeker with you.	labels:I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the Cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason..	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you?\nI'm fine, but could be better just not too happy with my situation. Hope you are doing great. The seeker is relieved to speak to her friend. The supporter is also happy to hear that the seeker is not too happy.	labels:I am well. What's going on?
text:yes, have a friend who I'm very close to , but have noticed she doesn't tell me the truth this days. And not only that she has been distancing as in not calling , always waiting for me to call. I call her about a week ago, but wasn't happy how she dismissed my call within seconds telling me she will call me back only for her not to call till to day. I don 't feel like calling her again. The seeker feels sad, depressed, frustrated, stressed, and confused. The seeker's feelings are important as it is one of the main reasons to be honest with your mate and make adjustments to your life. Your mate has to make sure you are giving your best. Your mate doesn't have to be lying about	labels:So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are.

The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel like being loved.	labels:This must be very hard on you. How does this make you feel?

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger.
text:That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.. The seeker s surprised to hear the reason. The supporter is surprised to hear the reason. The seeker is surprised to hear that what a huge mistake she made was to let this person see her feelings. That's why she has been going on about this for so long.	labels:I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.. I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!
text:I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.. The seeker feels happy, relieved and content. The support of other listeners is helping her to focus on her problems and also make her calm down. She would rather focus on the issues of her anxiety and depression and not have to suffer with depression or anxiety.	labels:People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this..
text:Thanks for understanding, I feel better now.  I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on. The seeker have been with you. I am very proud of you, and you know that. As I said before, I can only let you know that I am happy that I am close to you, that I am just a lonely little girl, and that	labels:I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!
text:You have been a big help and I can't thank you enough. The seeker am using the following to help you.	labels:Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?

I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.

The seeker feels very depressed. She feels she is not loved. This is a very negative experience. She is not sure if her feelings are real or not. She is worried.

Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. The seeker and supporter discussed her hobbies.	labels:Why did you stop playing insturments?
text:I just lost interest. I'm losing interest in everything, man. I think it's time for my heart to give out and make space for the new, ya know. Cross my fingers at least.

The supporter should not say anything about being depressed.	labels:I certainly hope you don't do that!

text:I have tried to talk to him but he seems very uninterested at times. I even tried going to counseling with him and that didn't work. It's just frustrating. He was with me when the one doctor had said just how bad it was and he didn't seem to really pay attention. He was also there when I had to have an emergancy blood transfusion and it was really hard to read him. He just doesnt say or so much. The seeker feels anxious and worrying. The sponsor should ask for a quick hug and a gentle goodbye. The seeker should feel the emotoin give a warm welcome and a hug then make a happy face before leaving.	labels:Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.
text:Yeah whenever I try it's like pulling teeth. I know some of it is how he was brought up. I don't think his dad ever showed much emotion/ so yes I'm sure that has something to do with it. I also feel bad a lot of the time because I have two kids. I feel like I fail them a lot. our oldest was born before I got sick. Our youngest was a miracle baby.

The seeker is scared to do this.	labels:Have you been able to talk to your kids about this as well?

text:She won't talk to me.  I am out of state (back home with family).  She told me when I was up here.  She blocked me on everything.  This new person is already living with her or staying there all the time.  When I call this other person answers her phone and talks trash.  She won't let me talk to my wife at all. And obviously my wife does not attempt to talk to me. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about being alone with her boyfriend.

The supporter should let the seeker know that she is lonely and should let the seeker talk about it.	labels:I would definitely get back into that stuff too!

The supporter should provide some care to the seeker while she is in distress.	labels:It sounds like you have been treated very poorly, do you agree with that?.
text:Yes I have and everyone says to move on.  I just don't know how to let her go in my head and heart. If she called me today and said come back I probably would go.  I know I'm weak.  I just love her. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should let the seeker feel she is cared for.	labels:Are there potential financial issues or do you think she'd be prepared to reach an amicable settlement?.

The reason is that the seeker needs to get married. The supporter needs to be a nice person.	labels:She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!.

The seeker feels very depressed and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should talk with the seeker about the situation.	labels:Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, I believe. Would you consider them?.

I would of never married her if I wasn't in it till the end. The seeker ink she could be doing something about it?	labels:I hear you on that. Unfortunately some people do not take commitment as seriously as others. I have been in that position and had my heart broken..

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:You don't think people like you or care about you at work? What specifically have they done to make you think this?
text:I just feel like no one talks to me and if I try and talk to them they are very dismissive. The seeker does not feel depressed. The reason is that the seeker feels depressed. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker that the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable..
text:I feel like I go out of my way to help people and I remember their birthdays and I try and be nice to them but no one ever does the same for me. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should go and ask for more information.	labels:I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean.. I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself. I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely..
text:I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is that the seeker is afraid of making her feel like nothing is happening. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel like she is loved.	labels:I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.
text:I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I’m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of. The seeker felt lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker does not think she is being generous. The seeker does not know if she has some other way of doing things.	labels:I also had this happen, I had no friends and at first I thought it was me, then I realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy.. How do you feel they take advantage? Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story..
text:I just feel like they just expect me to do things for them now and when I do it, it’s no appreciated because they just know I will do it. The seeker felt stressed. A seeker doesn't like being called a "friend" or being asked to do something that is not appreciated by others. The seeker felt lonely and worried. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?.
text:Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries. The seeker was trying to make things clear on the topic. She had the message:	labels:I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes.  Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense.  Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first..

text:Things have changed and my new supervisor has crushed my spirit by taking all the parts I love away.  She never liked me and now she gets to make me suffer. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should move on.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?.
text:They really can.  I used to love my job and my team.  Now she has made everyone miserable because she just doesn't care about learning the job or the job at all.  My morale is low and worse because I can't help my peers who are struggling as well. . The seeker elt lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something..
text:I have considered this many times.  Unfortunately, the next level manager doesn't respect or value my team in general.  She has made that clear.  She's also just awful and uncomfortable to talk to.  I've found her to just be mean sometimes.  It just feels so hopeless.  Just waiting for someone to notice.  Just hoping she fails.. It's just really hard to show up everyday.  But I do.  Although the days are long and exhausting with no motivation to perform. . The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that she worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The seeker worries about taking up arms against the current in her life.	labels:Please try to stay positive - bullies never prosper in the long term. I think that you need to talk to your co-workers about this and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement between you. Alternatively, have you ever considered seeking another job? I know that that might feel like selling out but you might be happier somewhere else.
text:You are right.  She is a bully.  I have called her several names to myself, but not a bully yet.  My coworkers and I have discussed what options we may have.  My suggestion was that we work at our normal pace rather than scrambling to make up for her failures.  I wouldn't want to set her up, but I think her failing is the only way we will ever see a solution.. I have applied for another job within my company.  There seems to be interest in me, so that's exciting.  It is a job I really want.  But then, of course, I feel bad about leaving my peers behind.  I really care about them. . The seeker nks about her situation and tries to resolve it. The seeker wants to go back to her life.	labels:I feel that that is fair enough. You should not be working to make up for her failures and I hear you saying that you feel that this is w hat is happening?.
text:Definitely. Everyone is struggling.  I am the one my team expects to help with some of the tasks she is not performing.  I'm happy to do it for my team, but there is no recognition.  But I think I have been giving them good advice about hanging in there, staying positive, etc...  I should probably listen to myself. The seeker feels depressed and insecure. I think that the seeker's needs are not being met.  I am happy to help help them.	labels:(sorry was afk give me a second to catch up :)). I really feel that you have grounds for a formal complaint. Just her being incapable is bad enough but bullying too is unacceptable.
text:Most definitely. I feel more confident now about the anonymous reporting.  I'll gather some notes from my peers to ensure I have a viable complaint.  That's so helpful.  Thank you.. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:You are most welcome, enjoy your day!.	episode_done:True

The seeker 's face is bright and clear. It is a clear and present day. The seeker looks up to the sun.	labels:Well, drinking doesn't really deal with it.

The supporter will tell her that she needs help. The seeker should talk to her about how she can help the seeker, and how she can help the supporter to talk to her.	labels:Being upset can make someones mind race and make it really difficult to rest or get any sleep at all.

The seeker will ask the seeker to go at least once a week as long as she is healthy.	labels:I think it is a trade off for us -- do we risk a disease we have a 99.9996% chance of survival from according to the CDC or stay at home and despair?  I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short. Hug those you love, you may not have them tomorrow, plandemic or not.. I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz.. I was feeling REALLY lonely last month, and then I started a gratitude list and that helped, then I called some people and began to make new friends. It really helped a lot..

The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:Thank you for your kind words!  You should invite your friends. I don't think living in fear is actually living. It feels like death..

The seeker ants to meet a person who has been there, a person who has been affected by this pandemic. This is a very personal conversation for you. You are a friend and support. This is a conversation for the seeker. The seeker can try to make the seeker feel at peace.	labels:You are welcome. I am happily married now, but I had my fair share of breakups. They hurt my self esteem. I had to work hard to not let that happen. And do my best to grieve, but not get stuck there.. If a man did not want to be with me, I took it hard as rejection, but in the long run, if he does not want to be with me, I don't want to be with him, but that takes time, and you need friends to encourage you..
text:you really are a strong person.. yes. if i follow him, i will be the one to get hurt. its time for me to accept the reality. The seeker feels strong. She is strong and willing to listen. She is aware of the situation. She is happy and even happy. The seeker feels safe. She has been through a lot.	labels:Thank you. I'm older, been through a LOT of hard knocks.

It is a shock to you now, but he never even communicated this with you over time, and he should have. that's what you want in a partner.. If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive.

I suppose I used to be able to distract myself with the outside world and right now I cant. The seeker feels depressed and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?.
text:I have tried, he won't go again. We have before and it didn't really help. He argued with her. The seeker feels more depressed. The reason is because the seeker feels lonely. The supporter should tell her that the seeker isn't happy with her, but that she's happy to help.	labels:My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again.. That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help.  And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change..
text:I am happy it worked for you :) I just dont see it working with us. Hes pretty stubborn. I also struggle with a severe auto immune disorder so that is always weighing on me as well. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately.. Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set?
text:Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :) The seeker had a very hard time with some bad feelings. She was worried about her boyfriend and not sure what to do. She was scared of what the situation would get worse with the pandemic. She was worried about the loss of her friends and family and being alone again. She worried about her family and	labels:It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant.. little ones . . ..
text:For a few months I eased up and let them play at the park, but we live in MI which is having another huge spike, especially our county. Thank goodness we have a pretty large yard for them to run and play in but I also know its not the same. The seeker lt at peace, reassured and in control. She got the information about the pandemic, and he got some good news. I think he was ready to tell the whole story.	labels:One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain. I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump.
text:Sounds like a plan for sure :) I will do this, he would really enjoy it! The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:I'm glad I could encourage you. You sound very intelligent and caring. Marriage is hard work, so is motherhood, but it can be rewarding and fulfilling. Sometimes we lose track of that and we need ideas to perk us up again and help us remember our goals..	episode_done:True

text:hoping the same. want to  be the happy person like i was before. The seeker feels lonely as well as worried. The reason is that the seeker does not have the strength to stay in a relationship.	labels:Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you'll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can't control.

text:Yes, the court right now. They are moving so slow with Covid. I'm just worried my kids will forget me. or not love me anymore. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is the seeker worries about losing her boyfriend. The supporter should tell the seeker the family situation is out of control.	labels:Does he allow you to have any contact with your children?
text:Not at this time. The court is in favor of their father. This situation is a little stickier. In July, I sent recordings of him being abusive to me, to my mother. I told him I wanted a divorce and I didn't love him anymore. Next thing I know, I'm being arrested for "hitting" him, which never happened. so I am trying to beat this criminal charge. The seeker feels very distressed about the situation. The reason is not mentioned.

It's just the risk of exposure that made me stressed. The seeker feels anxious as she is worried about the potential of the pandemic.	labels:I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious. Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there? Often it helps to keep in touch with previous co-workers, especially during a time like this.
text:Yes, I do have the numbers of a few of them. I talked to them a little during the day but I mainly kept to myself as I planned my next few steps. I was just ashamed for having left after they have been so helpful. I pride myself in being loyal and supportive but it was just too much risk to myself and family. The seeker is feeling lonely. The reason is because the seeker is afraid of breaking up with the boyfriend. The supporter should reassure the seeker that she is safe and that she can return to work.

The seeker feels happy and confident. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter is not happy about the situation. The seeker should not ask for anything.	labels:You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her. Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?
text:That is a very sensible way to look at things .. I do rationally realise that. Irrationally I just want him to come back to me and say that he made a mistake, though!. The seeker thinks that he is being misunderstood. The supporter should say that he does not think that he is being misunderstood, but he has been thinking that for a long time.	labels:I understand, it's easy to get sucked back into the nostalgic good memories of when things were at their best.
text:That's exactly it! I keep thinking of all the good times we had together and the things that we did before her met Her. I just want those times to come around again even though I know they should not.. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is not mentioned.

The seeker feels lonely, worried, angry, angry, scared, stressed, upset and sad.	labels:Do you have a group of friends, or activities to keep you busy while you're going through this? It helps to keep your mind distracted :) And you are so welcome! I've been through my share of breakups too, it's never fun!
text:I do have some good friends but we also had some mutual friends who have been a bit distant with me since the break up. I guess that I really don't need them though, huh?. The seeker was talking to her friend. The seeker was in her own space. The seeker was not the target of the seeker. The seeker was looking for a group of people who were in love with her. The seeker was just in a space that was not her own.	labels:Friends come and they go, it doesn't have to be a game of choosing sides. Keep in touch with those that keep in touch with you. Or maybe reach out to some other friends you haven't connected with in awhile..
text:That is good advice too. Or maybe I could do something to help me make new friends? Do you have any suggestions?. The seeker feels depressed and sad. When the ppl do not come back anymore, she feels sad. She is upset that the ppl have come back and she doesn't want them to come back anymore.	labels:Totally! It helps to get into group activities, like hiking to going to the gym, or a book club..

Thank you so very much for having talked to me - I do feel a good deal more positive now. I know that there is a long way to go but I think that I can see the light now..

text:I just needed to vent about it, I guess its slightly strange to have this issue... It is not like we all don't pay taxes and all that mess.. It is more or less that I got the middle man rate. Pissed me right off. The seeker feels annoyed and annoyed but not angry. The reason is that the seeker feels that the seeker is not going to be happy. The seeker needs to give her the support she needs and the seeker needs to let her know that she is being treated badly.	labels:Tell me what happened. That sounds horrible.
text:Well, I ordered my normal uhm, 'package' from my homie... Well he just took off as normal and came back in a few hours. We agreed on n160  for the whole mess and HE JUST DECIDES that its now 185 cause he needed gas, and what ever.. Nah man, I already fill your tank and food and he can grab some fries from the bag when he gets here. The seeker felt anxious. The reason is that if the seeker is feeling anxious, then that means that she will feel anxious when she buys her next item. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:wow. get him a gas card for christmas then he cant say anything next time.
text:haha YES! see it is a stupid thing. like dood we hook your ass up all the tome. time. The seeker felt frustrated and depressed. The reason is that the seeker feels unhappy. The supporter should also ask for more details.	labels:People suck.

The reason is that she was trying to make up for her loss and now the seeker is going to need more messages. The seeker should be in a rush to get some of that. The supporter needs more time to get her to look at a picture of the girl.	labels:they read them 10 each.
text:SO one more response from you, and I hope the researchers take this part as I HAVE a time schedule to adhere to, and MUST get back.

text:It's mainly my husband. His spending habits are out of control. He thinks he need to reward himself for living. We can't survive if he keeps gifting himself. The seeker feels happy and is happy with her life. The support should say her thank you message.	labels:Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?.
text:I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself. The seeker is happy and has a good day. The seeker wants to help.	labels:So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?.
text:Exactly. And if I push further, he compares himself to other people: "Well, at least I don't hit you." or "At least I'm not an alcoholic" Like I should thank him for existing. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It sounds like a really toxic relationship - I hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end I felt that I had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though..
text:It's hard because we have children. When we were just dating, he was a different person. He didn't start to act this way until after our eldest was born. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is that the seeker feels lonely. The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around her who have problems with the seeker.	labels:Ah, unfortunately a lot of men are like that - before you become seriously committed they seem totally different. Have you considered seeking professional help?.
text:The problem all boils down to money. If I had enough for therapy I wouldn't be worried about his spending habits! lol. But, you're right, that's probably what we both need! The seeker felt she was getting some help to fight her depression. If she had more money to spend, she probably would have been happier.	labels:I believe that there are some organisations that will offer free therapy sessions for people in need. Have you considered asking your doctor?.
text:Really? I'd definitely be interested in that. Do they have online therapy like that? The seeker feels stressed. The reason is that the seeker feels stressed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I am not totally sure what is available but I think that there might be such things.
text:Thanks for your help. You said you've been in similar relationships. Is this behavior common for men?. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is because the seeker thinks she doesn't need to be alone to feel better. The supporter should explain the reasons why this is the case.	labels:Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, however, there are some bad apples who give all men a bad name. I am sure that the same applies to women too though!.
text:Haha, true. I just wondered. I had previous relationships, but they were very short.  My dad was always the opposite: he was a penny-pincher. Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just to stingy with the money, but then I remember that we have none, so Idk how to be more generous lol. The seeker felt lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish..

I am also a student taking online classes this semester. I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective. I find that making regular online meetings with my professor, while it might not help with the physicality of your work, at least provides mental and motivational boosts. Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?
text:honestly its all a shit show right now. Everything is tied up in logistics and stop and starts. this year has been almost a wash. The seeker is stressed by her feelings for her boyfriend. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter must ask for more details.	labels:It's been the same way at my school.

text:true, I guest if the ship goes down we all go down. The seeker feels very tired and disoriented. The supporter should help the seeker get back to normal.	labels:If there's only one thing to take from this, it's knowing you aren't alone. I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times..
text:I believe that too. thanks for the reassurance. I just have a hard time sitting still. The seeker feels angry with the seeker and the supporter. Again, the seeker feels angry. The supporter tells the seeker that they need to feel real emotional support.	labels:I definitely get that. It's especially hard because we've had to sit still for so long. It's almost been a year since things were normal. It's kind of like we're just waiting for real life to start again.
text:imagine when it happens. when everything is the way it was a year ago. a beer. at a bar. The seeker feels like she's going to miss the people around her. The reason is that the seeker felt the same way. The supporter might not be able to focus on the topic, but in the end these are the things the people around her are going to miss.	labels:That sounds incredible. Or just to be able to go into a store without a mask and hand sanitizer and constantly monitoring how close you are to people. It's almost impossible to imagine, to be honest. But when that day finally comes, it'll be one of the best days of my life. We can finally start putting all of this behind us..

The supporter should tell the seeker to take a look at the friend list before contacting the seeker.	labels:wow. in our connected world it is hard to get away. do you want to tell me how it happened.
text:Yeah it is. Well we have been having trouble staying closely connected since the lockdown. We tried to make time for one another, but it has been tough. I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder. .

The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:that's a good idea. Have you thought about disconnecting?

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees.

The seeker is trying to get out. The supporter feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should explain some ideas and keep the seeker in the loop.	labels:Again, I think you were the mature one that ended the relationship. It is hard to see her "move on", but you will do the same. covid has changed the environments to meet people though, and all I can suggest is to be patient. The world will get back to normal. and you will too.

text:I have been thinking about it. I haven't made up my mind yet though. The seeker has been overwhelmed by emotions. The support provided by the seeker feels overwhelming. If this person could do what she does, what she does, this would be great for the seeker. However, it is possible to lose a pet on a whim and lose that pet as well.

You want to help, but not because they guilt you into it, that seems unfair.. Maybe they will offer double time?  lol That would be nice..
text:Exactly, she has to understand that life goes beyond work and I have been a very loyal worker for more than 18 years so I think she is trying to fight a fight where she definitely can lose.

She is afraid for her feelings.	labels:So you feel as though you are trapped .. you can't leave school but at the same time you are being put at risk through no fault of your own.

The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more detail.	labels:I'm so sorry to hear this. You must be full of all kinds of emotions now. What are your plans?

The supporter should just ask for more details.	labels:I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change..
text:But, how do I know for sure if he did cheat? The seeker feels angry. She thinks she's cheated. The seeker's anger is not a good thing. Why do you think she has this anger?	labels:It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?.
text:The messages were about meeting up for a photoshoot at the brooklyn bridge. is that cheating because he lied. The seeker is worried about the loss of her boyfriend. She was so stressed when she met her boyfriend.	labels:I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling.. Do you meet up with your exes?
text:i'm still friends with many of my exes, but he knows that and we all hang out together. thats why it's weird that he lied. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned.

The supporter will tell the seeker that she is not doing him any favors and you will have to deal with him.	labels:Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.. Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?
text:yeah, she's a photographer. she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually. when they were together. The seeker also felt like she was getting betrayed. She was afraid of the man who cheated on her, and she was not sure if she wanted her boyfriend to be her friend.	labels:I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it..
text:i worry that i am jumping to conclusions. The seeker est with you now and tell you everything. You can get him to move to Nashville too.	labels:You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.
text:never before. i guess ur right. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots..	episode_done:True

text:She kept me going while I was gone, but since I returned, she's been so cold to me. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to explain the reasons why she feels it is so important to have a good relationship with her.	labels:Do you feel that is unfair of her to have done this whilst you were away serving your country?.

The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:But she should have understood that you were doing your duty whilst also providing for the pair of you.

The reason is that she has a lot of questions about her relationship, her finances and her future.	labels:Ah I see. How committed did you feel to her?.

The supporter should ask for information.	labels:I know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are..

text:It has peaked my interest, but at the same time, I wonder how much of this is just me buried in the idea of a relationship, even though it's pretty one-sided now. Should I seek counseling for a relationship that technically wasn't official? The seeker felt like she was not giving up. The reason is that she felt lonely and bereft. The supporter should help her.	labels:I am hearing you say that you still have feelings for her but you are not sure whether to totally break away or not, given that she has.
text:Yes. I hate how I love her, but I'm not getting the same energy back. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I can't tell you what to do but I think it might be best to go with your gut instinct..
text:It will hurt, but it's definitely better just to move on, right? My gut tells me that I'm not going to take 2nd place in her heart. The seeker feels worried. The support should be done by the seeker herself.	labels:It has to be your decision but I think you will know if you've made the right one..
text:I really appreciate it. The seeker gives a more detailed and detailed description of how she felt at first. Is this about her love for you, or is it about her feeling lonely and bereft? Is it about her wanting to move on and support you? I don't know, I don't know.	labels:I hope that I have been able to give you some good advice and that you feel a little clearer about things now..

text:Hi! How are you tonight?\nI've been better. I just buried my dog yesterday. She was going to turn 15 next month. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that. I never lost a dog, but I've lost cats.. Is 14 a good age for a dog? I have my first dog so I don't know much, he is 9 years old and came with our house..

We moved from FL to KY and the little dog just hung out here, he really belonged to the neighbor's son who didn't want him, so he just ran around wild and wouldn't leave. I never had a dog, but it got cold, so i took him in. They never asked about him and after a week, I asked them if I could have the dog, so they said yes. I don't think they cared. I wish I could give you a hug, really, there are no words to make this better as you already know the grief of losing a pet, it does get better, but it stings terribly at first.

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:So you definitely are a dog lover! I was in my 50s before I ever had a dog, now I wish I had more, they are really loving. Not like cats who don't care much about much except FOOD! lol. I know when tragedy happens, I can't get stuck in depression, I sort of have to force myself to put one foot in front of the other. It's hard to have a healthy balance between grieving and continuing to live. Cry, then dry my eyes, pick up, go for a walk, don't get caught in grief, but yet don't deny it!.
text:They get to be so close and you can really pick up on their emotions and stuff. That's what happens to me. I get stuck sometimes.

The seeker's heart goes out to the seeker, but the seeker doesn't feel it.	labels:I get stuck too.

Just to know I'm  not alone.

The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I do understand. My mom died in 2010, right after she died, 1 of my cats died, my husband went into the hospital and almost died, so we went on vacation so I would not be consumed with grief, and do you know, we brought our pets and our cat died when we arrived here on vacation?  I will never forget that. You know what. I knew I could either get consumed in grief, or push through. Man, that was hard. I prayed a lot and God got me through that and I had a good vacation, all things considered. I will definitely pray for you too that God will comfort your heart and that you will be comforted by your other dogs and your boyfriend's dogs and that you will feel joy at times at the happy memories you had with your dog..
text:You too. Thanks so much. bye. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:I have one more thing to say - wise words from this 92 year old lady at church named Sue. She told me this after my brother died. When you get older, everyone you know is practically dead.  She said "Life is for the living, if you get caught up to much in all the death, you won't life."  True words. God bless, have a good night. .	episode_done:True

text:I think that is good advice. Maybe even a cancer support group? I want to make sure I’m encouraging her. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Counselling can be expensive but there are some charities out there that offer a few sessions for free. Yes that is an excellent idea and you could both join the same group.
text:That is a good idea. I know with covid it is important to be mindful of cost. The seeker feels stressed. The reasons are not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:How do you feel in yourself at the moment? Are you worried about your own health?.
text:I’m not worried about my health. More worried and sad about her. Especially not knowing how severe it is yet. It seems like any extra stress this year is harder to handle. The seeker feels sad. The reason is that the seeker feels sad. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:You are certainly not the only one who is feeling this - it has been a terrible year. Cancer is bad at any time but this year it is especially awful..
text:I agree. It feels like everything is just a bit harder to get through. The seeker feels isolated. This feeling is very intense and deep. She feels scared of being alone and scared of the people around her but it is not something that can be shared with anyone.	labels:I am hoping that in the New Year things will be better .. maybe in January the world will look like a more positive place..
text:I’m trying to be hopeful to. That said I think it will take another year or two to get there. The seeker not caring about others?	labels:I hope that things go well with you and your mentor..
text:Agrees. Thank you again. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:No problem. I should probably leave now :).	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you?\nI am doing ok.  How are you? The seeker is confused and confused. The reason is her boyfriend is still at home. The supporter should help the seeker to calm her down.	labels:I'm doing well, thanks for asking. What are you seeking support for today?
text:I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks.  This is a really hard time of year for me.  I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year.  We were very close.  I was 17 at the time.  Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life.  Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident.  I dread the holidays. . The seeker feels that she needs to do something today. She wants to be with her boyfriend and have a happy family life, but she does not want to break up with him.	labels:Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?
text:You are exactly right.  The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner.  She died 4 days later on Dec 29th.  And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year.  He died on Jan 3rd.. I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present. The seeker has some feelings for her boyfriend. She thinks he is a little bit needy.  I don't think he is.  I think he is just jealous of her feelings for him.  I really feel like he has something to hide.  I think he is in a place where he wants to	labels:I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?
text:My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close.  He is alot younger than me.  We just never had the connection like his sister and I did.  And both my grandparents have passed away.  Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now. My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same. . The seeker feels happy and fulfilled. The supporter does not. The seeker feels good about herself and her life. The seeker feels like an inspiration to her. The seeker is not alone.	labels:I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.. Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?
text:They say it gets easier. And I agree it does.  Things just have changed so much.  I miss how life was before I lost them. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company..
text:I love giving gifts.  And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give.  My nieces and nephews can't wait every year to see what I got them. . The seeker feels happy. The proponent should be honest with the seeker and tell the seeker that she needs to feel that she has been given something by someone else.	labels:That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year..
text:They will love them.  A couple years ago I put their names on fleece blankets when I worked at an embroidery shop.  They absolutly loved them! The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:And I see, it sounds like the changes in your life are potentially impacting your daughter as well. However, I'm glad you have each other for support this season. This year has been crazy for many reasons, and many people tend to find comfort in routines or traditions. Do you and your daughters have any holiday traditions you typically complete? Awesome gift idea! Personalized gifts are always so heartfelt and appreciated. Good thinking!	episode_done:True

text:Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him. The seeker felt lonely. The reason is that the seeker feels lonely. The seeker needs help.	labels:Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!.
text:I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?

The seeker felt depressed and worried and was worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should explain what caused the depression and what should be done to help her break up with her boyfriend.	labels:I have previously had counselling and found it very useful but there is a long waiting list for a free counsellor.
text:I don't feel guilt about it.  Now at least.  I was pretty hard on myself at first.  But I know that he knows why I was upset that morning.  It was something we dealt with a lot. . The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Are you still in touch with his family and friends?
text:I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is the seeker doesn't know how to deal with her emotions. The seeker is trying to explain how she feels.	labels:I think you should do things in your own time but I would recommend doing it again one day..
text:Have a good night. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:And you too, goodnight.. You can leave now :) I will just wait around till you've gone..	episode_done:True

text:About a month ago I found him looking at provocative pictures on Instagram of girls he didn't know but I am friends with and he admitted he did that repeatedly on many occasions, even when I was at his house in the other room. he also searched for repeatedly this girl in one of his online classes who is very provocative to look at inappropriate pictures of her and I thought that was super weird I was so annoyed. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Have  you told him how you feel and asked him to stop doing that?
text:yeah and he has stopped he deleted insta but it still hurt my feelings and trust a lot. and he lied to my face abt watching porn, I would not have been mad at all so there was no reason to lie about it but it made me sad and feel rly bad that he couldn't tell me. The seeker is worried. The supporter should know that the seeker has been lonely for a while now. On the other hand, the seeker may not want to do anything to the seeker and the supporter should say that if the seeker is lonely, the seeker is lonely.	labels:Ok, it's a good thing that he stopped. What he did was bad though, no denying that..
text:its not cheating though bc he never did anything w anyone its just a violation of trust buuutt I don't know how big of a deal it is. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should let go of the seeker and let the seeker go. Don't let anyone tell you that. If you know how to be afraid of your own feelings or not, you will feel it.	labels:Maybe he feels ashamed about watching porn, that's why he tried to hide. I would hate it too if my partner watches porn.
text:yeahhh, my friends have given me very mixed opinions abt what to do lol. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should tell the seeker to calm the seeker down and tell the seeker this is not a problem.	labels:Other than that, is there anything else?
text:and it wasn't just like he lied once he did it constantly over the course of a year of dating  and hid everything and cleared his search and all that. he gets very upset when I bring it up. that's mostly our issue its just hard for me to move past it bc I was cheated on by someone else in the past so it makes me hard for me to forgive him and not be jealous lol. The seeker is happy and seems to be content with his situation. The supporter should ask about a possible break up with her boyfriend and the seeker should explain what he thinks about the situation.	labels:I think you should be firm, let him know how much you hate what he did and how much it affected you. I think it's a serious issue, him not being honest with you over trivial things. At the same time, breaking up  without any other issues is kind of not optimal considered you;ve dated for 1 year.
text:I mean I def let him know I hate it. The seeker has made the decision to break up with her boyfriend. She decided to leave him and let him know she loves him. In the same words, she is trying to be cool with him.	labels:Did you see any changes in behavior after that?
text:I feel like its maybe not something worth breaking up over but its just gross and makes me feel bad. The seeker feels upset and stressed. She feels scared and wants to break up with her boyfriend. The supporter should say that they should break up with her, and explain that they won't be able to do this again.	labels:you should tell him that, and let him the problem is you feel disrespected when he watches porn while dating you.
text:I appreciate it. should I break up with him since I can't get over him doing that. The seeker <empty annotation>	labels:Breaking up over this is a pity, however, he doesn't seem trustworthy after everything you told me. How about give him some time, 3-6 months and see if he changes at all. If not or if you really think he's not worth your time, go ahead and cut tie with him. you deserve someone who respects you, it doesn't take that much either.	episode_done:True

I have been in a similar situation and I really think that it is best that you move on from this. You do not need this level of toxicity in your life.

He's usually happier staying in the dark, otherwise it's too difficult to lift him up when he's depressed if I'm also depressed. The seeker felt scared. The sponsor should reassure the seeker that she's at least a bit close to having some children, but not the whole family.	labels:Then do as you think is best for your husband.

The seeker should explain why she feels that she is not fulfilling her duty to her family in this case.	labels:I think that that is an excellent idea and that you are being very mature about this.. Are you in contact with your ex at all?.
text:No, I made a commitment not to contact him. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:That seems sensible.

text:Hello, how may i help you today?\nHello: Thanks for offering to help.  My friend Mark is suffering from bi-polar disorder, and despite being on medication, is spiraling out of control. His mood swings are affecting his ability to stay employed and keep friends and family from wanting to interact with him. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The supporter should ask for more details and help the seeker get into a better mood.	labels:I am so sorry about your friend mark. I will try my best to help you today. Is your friend mark behavior affecting you?
text:I suspect he's not taking his medication as prescribed.  He's become a sociopath, which I understand is common with people suffering from this disorder.  He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life. The seeker does not feel happy. The reason is that the seeker feels sad. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:To confirm your friend mark, you suspect he is not taking his medicine and that is why he is acting the way he is?
text:Yes, it is affecting me.  In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional.  It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on.  I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made. That's my suspicion, because things seem to be getting worse, quite honestly. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I can understand how you feeling and that you are trying to help your friend. you are a very good friend for doing that.
text:I have talked to him repeatedly.  Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together.  Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Have you asked him about him taking his medication?
text:I have.  He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time).  I challenged him on it and told him it can't be "most of the time."  That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out. The seeker feels that things are getting worse.  He will start to feel depressed, that he can't care for himself, and that he can't have a safe space for his family.  In my opinion, this behavior is affecting all of us.  We've all been through similar experiences with people who	labels:ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.
text:You're right.  Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging.  Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course. . The seeker feels anxious. The reason is that the seeker feels anxious. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway. When did this exactly start happening?
text:Thank you.  I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless).  I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed. Funny you ask.  He's a grown man - 35-years old.  I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me. The seeker oblem sleeping with me or doing anything to help me.  I'm not sure how he feels about that, but his mood is	labels:I understand a lot..

The supporter should tell the seeker and their parents that they can help by helping them break up with their boyfriend.	labels:Hi! Of course. I am happy to help.. Oh wow, that is really stressful. You are such a godo person for taking on her children. You should feel really good about yourself..

Thankfully, the children are adjusting to it, probably because they are happy just to be in a stable environment.

A dear friend of mine is in rehab and had to give up her children, it is really awful to watch. It makes me feel so helpless, so i understand how you msut be feeling..
text:Thanks for being sympathetic and for the words of encouragement.  Yes, needless to say, Child Protective Services were involved, and I was granted Foster Parent status.  I'm sure your friend went down that road, sadly. Have you ever seen the video by the artist known as NF called "How Could You Leave Us?"  I'm afraid that's what's next for these kids. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should help the seeker to move on.	labels:Yes, she did. Her children seem very lucky to have you. Do they get along with your children? I haven't seen that, waht happens in it?
text:They all get along famously.   You can find that video on YouTube.  It's a true story of how his mother died from heroin addiction.  It's a powerful song. Hopefully, you never have to experience it.  Heroin (opioids) just grabs hold of people and doesn't let go. The seeker feels very lonely. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:That's so awful. the only thing you can do is show the kids love and make them feel cared for.. Addiction is a truly awful disease, people don't appreciate the toll it takes on families..
text:Thank you.  One piece of good news.  Her son went from failing most of his classes to making Honor Roll this trimester - that's what his advisor tells me. . You've been really helpful and considerate.  Chatting with you certainly made me feel better.  I think we can end the support session at this juncture if you've met your session requirements.

text:I ended things with my girlfriend last week. The seeker makes a decision. The seeker should be able to talk things through without the seeker being scared.	labels:I am sorry to hear that, what caused you to wan to end things?
text:Things have been pretty rough for the last few years. I found out she was hanging out with her ex and she lied about it. The kicker is that we live together and her family is planning on coming to stay with us for xmas. they already have their flights booked and now are trying to cancel. The seeker feels depressed. The reason is that the seeker is worried about her boyfriend.	labels:So from what I am hearing, you ended things with your girlfriend because she was talking to her ex and lying to you about it and you are feeling upset about it.
text:yeah, plus our relationship has been rocky for the past year. I think we are just loosing interest in eachother. The seeker feels alone. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should speak to the seeker.	labels:I understand your situation completely. I had a recent ex that I lived with who also was talking to her ex and hanging out with him and lying to me about it.
text:what did you do about it? The seeker is trying to understand why she chose to be with her ex. She didn't know her ex but that makes sense.	labels:The first thing I did was had a conversation to try and see why she was talking to her ex and lying to me about it. Trying to get closure is very helpful.
text:yes, i could see that. We have discussed and decided to end things. Like I said, her family was planning on staying with us for xmas, so now it feels like we ruined xmas for everyone. The seeker felt depressed and depressed. The reason was that she was trying to get closure.	labels:I know this is definitely a rough situation, but I am sure you can make it through it!
text:Yes it's just been a crummy year. I'm looking forward to being done with it. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I can understand that! I think it has been a rough year for everyone!
text:i agree, i just hope her family doesn't come out. She still needs to move out but I'm hoping her family doesn't come out to help her move.

text:I have not. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is that the seeker feels lonely. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it.
text:Okay, I may try that. What do you think I should do if they are negatively receptive of it? The seeker may be afraid of breaking up with her boyfriend. The reason is due to fear that her boyfriend is not doing enough to care for her. The seeker may not be aware of her situation. The seeker may feel lonely because of the feelings she feels about what she is being told. Some of the people	labels:Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming. So keep your stance and keep asking for the answer.
text:Yeah, I don't want it to come off as an attack on my end. Maybe I should wait, see if the issue occurs continuously, note that it has been observed on multiple occasions, and then stand my ground? The seeker feels depressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I'm pretty this has happened a few times already, hasn't it? so you have every right to be upset and confront them, you shouldn't feel like you're attacking. You are just asking for what you deserve.
text:Yes, but I feel like I need proof, you know? Like how you previously said, to make sure I am not in the wrong. That's true! The seeker feels like her feelings are being attacked. The supporter should put her feelings in context and explain what happened.	labels:What you need to do is note down the occasions where they exclude you and ask exactly what happened then.
text:Okay makes sense. Then, I can ask like, was there a reason why I was not invited on this instance? Did I do anything to offend, etc. The seeker is concerned with the issues. The reason for the seeker's concern about the issue. The seeker does not think that the issue is over. The seeker thinks that it is a normal situation.	labels:Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix.
text:That is good advice. What is your advice if I still come out of the situation negatively (e.g. the friends do not seem to care about the friendship?) The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about her loss of her boyfriend. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:honestly, I think you also know that if you care about someone and they feel upset, you'll do everything you can to help the situation. Therefore, if your friends refuse to acknowledge your feelings, I don't think you should be friends either.	episode_done:True

I heard the words "good thing we have the power, if others knew we were getting our full bonuses they'd walk out" The seeker feels angry and upset. The reason is not mentioned.

There will be people hiring..

text:I like that. I especially like the idea of involving the kids. The seeker felt stressed. The reason is not mentioned.	labels:Just think of all of the ways our kids are learning to adapt to different life situations as well. That's worth just as much as their formal education.

The seeker is very upset with her boyfriend. The reason is because she knows the seeker will feel lonely. The seeker does wish that the seeker would have a relationship with her, or that she would have the time and support to make it happen, but these are things that are not really possible.	labels:That's a great idea, helping fill time with things to distract is a good way to relieve stress as well.

She may be thinking about something that is wrong with her or she might not understand why the reason for wanting to split up is so important. This type of relationship between a couple is not always a happy one.	labels:Somewhat but not identical.

The supporter asks she to give the seeker a call to find their next job.	labels:You don't want her to resent you for telling her you want her to move South, but that goes both ways.

The supporter should clarify the issues in the seeker's mind.	labels:Great, the sooner the better. I have a feeling you'll both be relieved when you do.
text:I agree! I don't know if it's something she's considered, because I've expressed interest in moving to the northwest just for fun, but I've also noted that the schools I'm actually looking at are Arizona and New Mexico. I do think the field she wants to go into could be applicable in almost any state, but I'll be gentle. I don't want to lose her, so if I need to look into a different section of my field, I definitely could. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more detail. Concretely, I'd like to know what is most important to her, and what she does for a living. If you can offer the seeker a more concrete understanding, she could offer her understanding of	labels:I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too.

This can prove to be very helpful with feelings of loneliness.. Not at the moment. I have alot of animals running around my home that I feed everyday. I mean outside critters. I did just have a jack Russell. She was the smartest dog I have ever had and I have had several. What kind of dog are you thinking of getting ?

text:hi there, how are you and how can i help?\nhey! not too bad but like i said. im going into university and my parents want to me to do architecture. when im really into engineering. money is a large factor so- The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:i see. are your parents paying for your university?
text:well money as in like salaries later on. tuition fees aren't an issue im in canada and all. but like architects generally make more money than mechanical engineers on average. so they don't approve my career path. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?
text:yeah exactly! but i don't like architecture very much, i don't find myself fond of art. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:that is a tough situation. it's definitely not easy to go against your family's wishes, but at the same time you have to do what's best for you.
text:well what's best for me is literally a good salary because i'd be lying if money isn't an issue. but am i going to be happy later on doing the job? The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there. but there can be careers in engineering that have connections to architecture as well, such as structural engineering.
text:yeah i agree. it's much more suitable if i could mix up the details of each career paths. but frankly i don't think my parents should be concerned with engineering either. it pays well and provides good stability. but like they said architecture suits my strengths more and i can go further with it. The seeker feels happy. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter should help the seeker find new and exciting careers.	labels:honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields. strengths doesn't always equal happiness though, so that's a tough one. have you considered speaking with both architects and engineers to learn more about each job? that might be helpful in your decision. sometimes what we think a job does, in actuality can be totally different in real life.
text:yeah! i went on reddit to ask students in my desired uni. and they all said that what they are doing is what you expect. architects said it's a booming business in Toronto. engineers is always in demand, but not growing. The seeker feels anxious. The support the seeker feels anxious about could be explained in part by the seeker's need to keep her feelings in check, or it could be explained in part by the seeker's need to keep the seeker happy.	labels:ah well i commend you on taking that step and actually trying to learn about the jobs. you seem like a really smart person and you're able to see things from a logical perspective.
text:thank you i've done the research to dispute my parents' arguments you see. but like- utimately its about how much i like it o not. *or. The seeker and the supporter were discussing how to get into the position of a planner. the seeker wanted to be a planner and the supporter wanted to be a planner.	labels:i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy. and worst case scenario: you can always change careers later if you find that you don't like what you're doing.

From personal experience, my best advice is to be as direct as possible. Demand respect and answers that you deserve after 13 years..

Clarity and answers are so important right now for you... no matter if it is true or not. That is a long time to be with someone.
text:That is great advice! It's very hard to stand up for yourself sometimes especially when you are emotionally devastated. I visited him unannounced at work one day and they were having lunch together.  I had no idea who she was and she got up and ran off.

It is not a coincidence that the seeker's mom is in the same boat as her ex. They have been together for 13 years.  She needs something to get over..	labels:You must express this in some way to let this out. It's not healthy to let your anger bottle up.

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand. I have been feeling the same way lately -- my family has been distracted and stressed and it's rubbing off on me. Are there other people around that you can spend time with?
text:Not really, I'm not a people person and the couple people I do talk to aren't supportive or going thru their own issues. The seeker can hear the seeker's own thoughts. The seeker can also hear the seeker's own feelings. It is important to know that a seeker will listen to the seeker's own emotions and feelings.	labels:I understand. It seems to me that much of what makes the holidays worthwhile is the opportunity to spend time with people we care about. It makes sense that you would have a hard time celebrating with nobody there to share it with you. Are you close with your family these days?
text:I have my family to share it with, my husband and kids. The teenagers are more about me buying them stuff and getting presents, and we're broke so I haven't been able to do the things I want to with my toddler.. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:(Even if you don't talk to them much, do you think it would be worth reaching out to them?) I see.
text:Outside of my household, I have my grandparents and some sibblings I don't talk to much.. The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Do you remember enjoying the holidays more when your kids were younger?
text:Absolutely! They always had great Christmases. I feel they're takking away from my toddler's christmas. The seeker feels sad. The supporter should know what she will miss most about her life and the people around her.	labels:I see. Do you know what has changed? You said that the teenagers are more interested in getting presents than actually celebrating the holiday itself. Is that a major reason? What about your husband?
text:That and the teenagers aren't listening well. They're kinda out of control. I don't think they deserve a Christmas, because they need to learn responsibility.. My husband tends to think they do no matter what.. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should help calm the seeker down and tell the seeker that the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.<|endoftext|>	labels:I see. You are frustrated with them because of the way they have been behaving. What do you think they should be doing differently? (Also, are you in a state where they have closed down the schools?)

text:Do you have kids?. The seeker is struggling with her baby, and her parents. She feels that her children are getting a lot of attention. I think their attention could be a big issue for her, but it doesn't seem that way.	labels:Something I tend to struggle with is the way things change over time, when they can never go back to the way they were before. When my sisters and I were little, it seemed like everything in the world was so much simpler, and we had certain Christmas traditions that we always looked forward to, like cutting down a tree, making pumpkin pie, and singing carols and Christmas hymns together. As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do. That has been pretty hard for me because things used to be so much different. Has that been difficult for you, as well? Just the fact that things are different now than when your kids were little. I don't have kids, no. I am still a kid, sort of. :) Also I've got a bad cold right now, which is why it's taking me a bit longer to respond as well.

Do you have some of the assignment done?
text:How did you get motivated? Do you have any advice? The seeker is a little lonely. She and the supporter are very lonely.	labels:I always thought of my GPA and how a single grade could affect all of my hard work. Perhaps thinking of what this grade can affect will motivate you to really avoid any stressful situations it may bring.

Image what life will be like once you are finished with this nightmare assignment. Give it your all. Find that fire inside of you and push through. You are almost there, remember everything you have overcome, dont let this little hurdle set you back. I have faith in you! Right now, dive into the subject, find outside resources. Hustle time. the great always struggle towards the end, you are one of those great! remind yourself of what you can do and have overcome.
text:Wow, biotech engineering must have been cool. Makes my economics module seem a bit silly now haha. I think I’m just getting frustrated with myself which is annoying in itself when I know deep down I probably could do it if I stopped trying to avoid it. The seeker is looking in the wrong place. The reason is that there is something going on outside her and she is not looking for help. The seeker has been told she makes a lot of mistakes and needs help. The seeker was not told that this is wrong. The seeker did not expect this to happen to	labels:oh no! my best friend has a business major and economics class almost killed her. she took it FOUR times before she passed it. She never gave up! this is your dream, chase it, own it, and conquer it. I am the champion of getting frustrated. I take a breather and come back. Always come back. take a nap or do something you enjoy doing..
text:I’m glad I’m not the only one who struggles with economics although I definitely don’t want to have to retake it haha. I guess I will have to retake it if I don’t actually do the work though!. I think even just being here is procrastinating really when I should be writing my essay!. The seeker feels frustrated. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:My poor friend, economics in itself is a beast that only unique minds understand. But, I do believe that with effort and dedication. She will be so mad for telling someone else how many times she fail the class. You can do it! you are at the end! get to work and make it happen!	episode_done:True

I told her this and she ignored me. The seeker feel lonely and depressed. The reason is not mentioned.	labels:I'm sure that's terribly frustrating having someone treat you like that. Is this something that your boss is aware of?
text:I have not told her yet. I do not want to get her into trouble and I want to have a good relationship with her.. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Can you discuss it with her in a respectful way to get her to understand that you're not trying to undermine her but that this is how you work most efficiently? And maybe mention that you don't want to involve the boss?
text:That's something I could try. I really care about my coworker and it makes me so angry that she treats me this way.. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should not give the seeker any advice.	labels:I think sometimes it's easy to jump to anger when you feel hurt. It might be worth telling her how you feel and also maybe ask why she thinks you should be doing things her way. Maybe there's a give and take in this situation. Some of her methods could be beneficial.
text:Do you have any advice on how to start my conversation with her? I have found some of her ideas to be beneficial. I just would like my ideas expressed as well. I feel we can learn from each other.. The seeker asks what she would like to do with her life. The seeker says to give her a gift of love and joy.	labels:Tell her the things that you like about her method and maybe suggest some of your methods to her as well. Maybe she'll find them to be more efficient. Make it a partnership rather than a fight for whose method is better. She could feel threatened by you so it's worth digging into those feelings with her and proving to her that you're working toward the same goal.
text:That's a great idea. It is possible. I am the new kid on the block. I will try by being non confrontational. Any specific ideas to how  I can do that? She gets offended easily. I want her to know I am helping.. The seeker feels very angry. The reason is that she has been doing it for a long time.	labels:I'd suggest how much she's helped you since you are in fact the new kid on the block.

So, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.

I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I've been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.
text:I agree fully and I'm happy for you. I think I've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything I loved. I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and I've shot up to 200.

The supporter should try to explain how she has done everything on her own to get the job and also explain why she wants to get this job.	labels:It seems that you are mixed up in the decision to put in extra funds in a professional resume polish or use your time and energy instead of actual financial means. Is that right?

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Well, I've tried meditating a few times before which doesn;t take it all away, it just takes the edge off!

What are you struggling with concerning time management?. I have also struggled with time management.

text:I am trying to manage having my kids's learn virtually at home, while I'm completing my Master's, and working at night. I feel like I have to drop my Master's because it all seems like too much.

text:That's a great idea! Two of my kids are old enough to work independently most of the time, they are 11 and 8. However, I also have a 3 year old that requires constant attention.

Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.

The seeker feels tired. The reason is not mentioned. The sponsor should not talk about the issues of the day or the person.	labels:You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.
text:Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful. The seeker ker: I am looking forward to the lesson that you have provided. I have been able to work on my Master's, and I am very excited for you.	labels:It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run.

They are both adults, I hope even with tension, they don't do anything inappropriate, do they?

I mean otherwise we could all still hang out and whatnot. The seeker feels isolated, and stressed out. The supporter should tell her that they can't be together.	labels:That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding. If you can't do anything to completely avoid your ex, maybe your best choice is to limit seeing her as much as possible.

And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it..

My real concern is for the boys . they see him treating me this way and will think its ok. they even said something  disrespectful to me and hubby was like you don't talk to your mom that  way. or ill knock your teeth out. he wouldnt but he doesnt  see how its his fault.

I have struggled to deal with depression most of my life, so I know it can be debilitating, but I have found ways to help myself. Is there a specific problem making you depressed, or life in general?
text:I'd love to hear them. There is one problem in general i'm having that i seem to have always had because of the Depression. I have an extremely difficult time falling asleep.. and whenever I do manage to fall asleep.. i wake up always feeling like crap. I never feel rested no matter how long i sleep. The seeker hopes to help. The supporter says something like, "I just wanted to tell you that you're not alone.. and I know that you are. I just wanted to let you know that you are listening to me.. and I want you to hear me. I want you to think for yourself why	labels:I have had trouble sleeping in the past and sometimes I still do, usually if it is when I'm nervous about the future. The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.
text:I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The support should tell the seeker that she needs more help.	labels:If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep. Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you.
text:I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that.. The seeker is worried about not being able to sleep. The reason is that she has trouble sleeping. She is worried about how to deal with the feelings, feelings of being alone, and worries about what she will say or think.	labels:I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.. I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.

In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help.

It's hard to explain. Her daughter and I hung out every day more than anyone else in the family hung out. I watched her. She always wanted to be with me and play games and talk with me. The day she left she drew me drawings saying 'I love you' and she told everyone she meant 'I love you' the most about me. and I cried and had a lot of anxiety symptoms afterwards because I'm literally not allowed to talk to her and I just feel she's in a negative place.

The supporter should tell the seeker that she is alone so he can feel safe.	labels:Yeah, it really comes out of nowhere.

The reason is that the seeker needs to be able to talk to her.	labels:Thank god! That will make such a big difference for both of you. Being alone would be scary.. Well he clearly loves you! I am happy that he's getting the treatment he needs and has someone so supportive like you helping him..
text:Thank you... it really helps to talk to someone. I worry about stressing out friends. Plus sometimes, they just don't know what to say, especially if they haven't known someone who has gone through it. How did your mom do? If you don't mind my asking. The seeker is worried.	labels:Your friends probably want to be there for you, don't be stressed about that. They just may need some guidance on how to be there for you .. My mom is doing great! Still in treatment but doing so well..
text:OH, thank goodness. I'm happy for both of you. It's just a strange year. I lost both my dogs to cancer in six months, then this. Then my cousin died of pancreatic in July.

I know I'm more worried about others than I am about myself right now.

The seeker worries about losing her boyfriend. The supporter should ask the seeker to keep this in mind.	labels:Maybe just reminding them that wearing masks protects both them and others could help?

The reason is that she is a student, so she wants to learn about the world in her own way.	labels:I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with.

I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.
text:Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense? The seeker feels stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things. .

The seeker is stressed. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference. .
text:Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it. The seeker feels overwhelmed. The sponsor feels overwhelmed and she doesn't know what to say. She needs to talk to her friend.	labels:Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.

The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it's confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on.
text:Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement?. I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened .. there is guilt that comes with that.. The seeker feels sad and depressed.	labels:I don't think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around.
text:Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.. The seeker feels lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it's completely normal and you shouldn't feel guilty for having it.

The seeker feels lonely and worries. The reason is that the seeker worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel love.	labels:Your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he'd love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued.
text:I know that he did :). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement!. The seeker feels like she is going to die. She feels like she is losing her life. The seeker really does feel like she is losing her life. The seeker needs to feel the love and support of her family and her loved ones. This is a conversation that is going to be filled with sadness and anger	labels:That's sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time.
text:Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun.. The seeker felt lonely. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving.
text:I can't really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money.. The seeker a to have a therapist in case you are grieving. I think that's important.	labels:he seemed to be a great man. Instead of regretting what happened, celebrate how great of a person he was.

text:Those sound like great ideas some of which I hadn't thought about before. The seeker looks for jobs.	labels:I had a college degree but found out my career wasn't working out financially.  Online college became a lifesaver because I could have the flexibility of being at home.  You don't have to be  exposed to COVID when doing online work or college options.
text:Yes, that's true.  Maybe that will help me pass the time too when it is so hard to be at home.  I would be working toward a long term goal. The seeker feels stressed.

text:it's great that you can relate. how are you managing those frustrations? The seeker is very worried about the safety of her life.	labels:The key, however, is our mindset and how we approach the problem. If you are afraid about going our during peak hours, you can step outside during non-peak hours. This is just an example. Everybody's situations and preferences vary. I am frustrated, but I cannot cultivate inaction. Because I have mouths to feed. So I have developed a mindset to tackle the problem by taking all the precautions I possible can.

There is a very clear message in there that the seeker needs help from the person who needs it most.	labels:It absolutely can take that edge off, but often so can many other things, like painting, writing, talking to a friend or a stranger even. I don't mean to suggest you stop any medication without medical advising. I simply mean to say that there are advantageous methods of therapy that dont involve a pill.

Maybe it is best to do these things in tandem?. The seeker felt lonely. The reason is not mentioned.

The supporter should help the seeker find space.	labels:I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID.

But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware..

The longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The reason is not mentioned. The supporter should calm the seeker down and tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.

The seeker any advice for people who are worried about the impact of COVID?	labels:I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them..
text:I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax. The seeker than having kids and having the option of having a father	labels:I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking..

I am not saying that I am a person that needs help, I am not saying that I am the one	labels:I had a similar experience in my college days.

I in turn, forgot to start the other projects that take a couple of days until friday (yesterday) so now these couple of projects wont be done by the deadline. The seeker asks for more details about the situation.	labels:Ok, if I understand correctly, you prioritized some work to be done later, which unfortunately had an earlier deadline, is that correct?

I know the mistake I made, but I'm afraid that won't be enough to make up for my mistake. The seeker is worried about the person they work with.
