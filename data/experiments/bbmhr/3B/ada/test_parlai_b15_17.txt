text:Good Evening.\nHello. The seeker received a greeting. The supporter should encourage the seeker to get more serious with the prospect. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should hold off on going to her job interview.	labels:How are you?
text:I'm pretty stressed out actually. The seeker is stressed out. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get some help.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?
text:Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates. The seeker has a huge stress on the exam, and it is because the supporter needs to explain about the exam. The supporter could let the seeker know that she did not finish the test, and that is why she is stressed.	labels:Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?
text:Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75% The seeker feels stressed. It seems to be the only thing that the seeker can think about. It is the only thing that the seeker can think about. This is the reason why the seeker is anxious about the exam.

text:I got a 62% on the test. The seeker  is stressed and worries about the test. The supporter can help the seeker think of strategies to overcome the stress.	labels:That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D.

text:Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class. The seeker  said that the test was low grade, and the supporter should ask the seeker what the test was.	labels:Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?
text:Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions. The seeker  feels not able to learn and fear the future. The supporter should suggest the seeker to find a tutor.	labels:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise....
text:Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be. The seeker  has a high anxiety about the grade. The supporter should ask the seeker to find a different class to make sure she is able to do well.	labels:OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!.
text:Yeahhh. Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice. made me feel ebtter. The seeker  feels she is not being welcomed in the class. The supporter could lead her to counseling, such as counseling for depression.	labels:If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a "Can-Do" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns! You're so very welcome!.	episode_done:True

The supporter should tell the seeker that she is not to talk about it and that the seeker is to keep the message to herself. The supporter could also tell the seeker to get help from a therapist.	labels:it's easier to see where others are going than it is ourselves sometimes. because there's not the emotion clouding the way.

The seeker  feels lonely, but the reason the backer did not mention is not described. The supporter should ask the seeker if there is anyone nearby and they should try to talk to people who are not in lockdown.	labels:before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options? you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?
text:Well, I could move out but I can't afford to rent a flat on my own. I'd have to move in with my parents, realistically.. I keep telling myself that but I feel really betrayed. I keep wondering what she is like and whether she is prettier and more successful than me.. The seeker  has been betrayed.

The seeker  is unsure of what to do. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should get a new partner.	labels:it's in our nature as women to ask "what did I do?" but it is never about us or anything we did..

The seeker  is worried that she is going to be a burden on her friends. The supporter could ask her what she wishes to do to change her situation.	labels:do you have a friend who has been through a similar situation? sometime that helps.also, sharing your burden with someone does NOT add to their burden.

The supporter should tell the seeker that sometimes you need to be honest with yourself. When you are in a relationship with someone, you need to be honest with yourself. The supporter should also tell the seeker that they can't help you if you don't think you are honest and that you may be lying to	labels:that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!
text:I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship. The seeker  feels guilty about lying to her friends and feelings. The supporter should tell the seeker that it is not her fault, but it is her responsibility.	labels:yes! LOL but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive.

The supporter can tell the seeker that she is not going to be able to get over it alone, but she is good at figuring things out for herself.

The seeker  emotional is upset because she did not tell the supporter everything. The supporter could suggest to go to the Apple store or go to therapy.	labels:I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with..
text:I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out. The seeker  feels confident and excited about their feelings toward their best friend. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to talk to someone or talk to someone else.	labels:How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.

The supporter could suggest an up to date book, or a new hobby.	labels:You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.
text:Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word. Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later.

The supporter could tell the seeker what the cause of the depression is.	labels:I would be glad to. What is troubling you?

What were some ways you tried to interact with people last shut down?
text:I use facebook quite a lot and it helps but it cannot compensate for face to face contact. I really need to be able to see people.. The seeker  feels a lack of connection with people. The supporter could help the seeker to find friends and family or a mentor to help her out.	labels:Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?
text:Well, part of the problem with that is that I am not sure what the rules are any more! We have been told so many different things that I am out of the loop.. The seeker  feels that she is not sure what the rules are. The supporter should try t talk to her friend.	labels:I understand. Try sticking to the basics to make it less stressful. Wear a mask outside at a distance..
text:I always do wear a mask.. I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again.. The seeker  felt lonely because of social isolation. The supporter could focus on how to help the seeker feel lonely. Supporter could also offer help in making friends. Supporter could also offer tips to help the seeker cope with stress. Supporter could also offer resources for coping with stress.

Just talking this out with the may be reassuring..
text:I have a little bit but I don't want to burden them. The other aspect is that it is making me anxious about many others things too. I keep having morbid thoughts about what will happen if the pandemic never ends.. The seeker  feels anxious by the pandemic. The supporter could convey this as an attitude or purpose to get the seeker to try to be more positive in her life.	labels:Thatâ€™s understandable. Maybe talking to a professional who you donâ€™t have to worry about burdening with your concerns will  allow you to talk about your concerns..
text:That's why I'm here ;). You are being very helpful, thank you! It's just nice to be able to tell people what I am worried about and not have them think that I am just being silly. The seeker  is worried about her fears from the previous shut down. The supporter could talk about internal fears and add more talk about talking to friends and family.	labels:Many people are struggling with the current state of affairs. Donâ€™t be afraid to talk to people they may also be afraid to talk to people and you could miss out on supporting each other..
text:That does sound like really good advice. The other thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I have been having financial pressures because I am on furlough. I am worried that if this lasts much longer I will end up deep in debt. The seeker  feels financial pressures because of the money. The supporter could tell her to look into the options to find a job and start saving.	labels:I am sorry that wasnâ€™t helpful.. Have you tried looking into local recourses in your city?
text:I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched.. The seeker  was let down. The supporter could have given the seeker more information about recourses and financial resources.	labels:That is true it has been hard for many people..
text:I do feel better for having been able to talk to you about this - thank you very much!. I think I will be able to carry on for a bit now. Thanks again and best wishes! The seeker  is relieved that the supporter understands the problem. The supporter could also tell the seeker that they can find more resources.	labels:Iâ€™m glad I could provide you some support.	episode_done:True

Please tell me more about how you are feeling so I can understand better.
text:Nothing seems to be fun and I work from home. The seeker  feels like she has to work. The supporter could tell the seeker to stop being so stressed and to make some changes.	labels:Are you doing okay workwise, getting enough done, getting it done on time?

text:I think this whole Covid thing has been depressing! I get my work done but it is a chore. The seeker  is not getting motivated to do anything. The supporter could suggest that the seeker stop getting discouraged and make other things happen.	labels:Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip..
text:I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out.. The seeker  is unable to get out of this funk because she is afraid that she can't enjoy her work. The supporter could ask her if she is doing okay. The supporter could also ask her to get more motivation.	labels:I am glad you are able to work, financial stress really sucks. I think Covid has us all down at least at some point..
text:Just want it to be over and then the election too! There has been so much emotional things in the world going on right now. BLM, election Covid... The seeker  has a lot of stress and fear about the election. The supporter should offer to go to work and work with the seeker.	labels:Yes, and it doesn't seem to have an end in sight. But at some point it will be over. If you don't feel more like yourself say a month from now I have to seeing a doctor because some depression requires it but that said some depression is normal and usually precedes change. I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way..
text:I would say when i take a walk at the park it does help. Also working out. So exercise and sunshine brings my mood up a bit. The seeker  feels attracted to working out. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to the gym and do exercises. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is not alone.	labels:You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.
text:good advice. I will try. The seeker  is feeling stressed because of the mood. The supporter can tell the seeker to go get some sunlight, exercise and maybe even something to eat.	labels:Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?
text:Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude. The seeker  is worried about the stress, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask the seeker if they want to talk more about it.	labels:Positive attitudes are never bad, slightly annoying to some first thing in the morning but in a good way. lol.
text:Yes, I need coffee first! Thank you for your advice! The seeker  is fidgeting in her seat. The supporter could say that she is nervous at work and she is trying to make her way to work. The supporter could encourage the seeker to get coffee.	labels:Coffee sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for sharing!
text:Happy Thanksgiving:) The seeker  is happy because of the holiday. The supporter could tell the seeker that the day is not stressful. The seeker could also tell the supporter that she is going to be in a nice mood.	labels:Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker  is excited about the prospect of going to college. The supporter could say to the seeker that college would help her to make the best of her life.	labels:Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?
text:I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it. The seeker  did not tell the supporter the issue with girlfriend. The supporter could also ask about the reason for the issue.	labels:Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through..
text:Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. The seeker  feels that she is scared of unfaithful behavior because she is worried about leaving her girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of work to do to prove herself to the others. It is up to the seeker to prove her worth to the others.	labels:I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
text:What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? The seeker  feels shame and the supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the friend. The supporter could also tell the seeker that he or she can talk to friends about this. The supporter could also tell the seeker that he or she and the friend are supportive and that it will be okay for them to talk about this.	labels:Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.
text:I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends. The seeker  feels like the cat that has got the cream because she has been accepted by the group of women.	labels:Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
text:I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. The seeker  is worried about the possibility of her girlfriend being cheating. The supporter should suggest the seeker to be more open to the possibility, but to be able to share a bit of her life and advice about that.	labels:Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
text:That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way! The seeker  feels like she is always being ridiculed and avoided. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is being mocked as she knows she is a joke and will be laughed at for not going after her boyfriend.	labels:Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
text:very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? The seeker  is afraid to talk to her girlfriend about her suspicions. The supporter could tell her she should talk with her girlfriend about her suspicions. The supporter could suggest that she talk to her girlfriend about her suspicions.	labels:Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
text:not at all. I appreciate your candour. The seeker  feels threatened, but she does not know why but the supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and talk about it. The supporter could also give her some advice.	labels:But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
text:All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. The seeker  feels insecure and jealous about the relationship with the supporter. The supporter could talk about the issues of feeling lonely and the attraction towards the seeker. The supporter could talk about the issues of the seeker being a joke and the potential for the seeker to leave.	labels:I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you feeling today?.\nHello. I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible? The seeker  felt OK but the supporter needs to get more of a response. The supporter could suggest to ask her a friend to bring her her coffee.	labels:Of course! What sort of issue is it?.
text:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best. The seeker  feels stressed, but the supporter could also tell the seeker to think of things to do that will make her feel comfortable in her job.	labels:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?.
text:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! The seeker  feels stressed, but the lack of job experience is not mentioned. The supporter could offer to help the seeker with the career change.	labels:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?.
text:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament? The seeker  is worried about not being able to find a promotion. The supporter should help the seeker. The supporter should also provide some advice on career advancement.	labels:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!.
text:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one. The seeker  felt stressed and worried about the work situation because of the fear of the future. The supporter could suggest that the seeker check out the job search and make it a priority.	labels:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that..
text:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser. The seeker  feels that she is stuck in a job that she no longer enjoys. The supporter could tell the seeker to leave the job and apply for another position.	labels:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing..
text:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal? The seeker  feels she is stuck in a boring job. The supporter can suggest to the seeker to look for more opportunities to do more interesting work.	labels:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?.
text:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years. The seeker  has a positive idea in mind and the supporter could tell the seeker the there are people out there. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker give someone a call for a chat.	labels:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?.
text:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-) The seeker  feels optimistic about finding another job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look for an outreach in the local community.	labels:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!.
text:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things. The seeker  feels nervous about her work situation and fears that her boss may not support her work. The supporter could try to explain to the seeker that the employer does support their staff and the manager does not. The supporter could also ask the seeker to put in a few hours at their office or come to their office to see if they can help her.	labels:No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!.
text:Yes true thanks for your understanding. The seeker  feels a bit troubled about her future. The supporter could also ask the seeker about the possibility of a change to her job. The supporter could also mention what she has learned about her work.	labels:You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.
text:You have indeed, thanks for this conversation. The seeker  tells the supporter that she is trying to find a better job and does not like her current job. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk about what she is doing and what she is looking for. The supporter could suggest a different career.	labels:Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!.
text:Will do, thanks again! The seeker  feels that she is going through a difficult time, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Erm .. cup of coffee?.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon how may I help you today?\nHello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why. The seeker  feels depressed because she is still struggling with going to therapy. The supporter could tell the seeker to get professional help.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
text:No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. The seeker  is not sure what depression is. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her sister or her family if that is the cause. The supporter should also ask the seeker to talk to her professional counselor or mental health provider if that is the cause. The supporter could also ask the seeker to also talk to her social worker.	labels:These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
text:I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. The seeker  feels depressed because of last meeting with psychiatrist. The supporter could explain the conditions to the seeker.	labels:Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?.
text:Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? The seeker  feels anxious because of being unable to talk to the psychiatrist. The supporter could keep a place where the seeker can speak to the psychiatrist.	labels:It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
text:What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. The seeker  feels stressed because of the issue of not seeing a psychiatrist. The supporter should suggest that the seeker could go to a mental health professional who can treat the seeker.	labels:Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app..
text:I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. The seeker  felt anxiety and that there are people around him. The supporter could explain what the problems are with the seeker.	labels:There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
text:I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? The seeker  feels depression stop getting better. The supporter should ask the seeker for any advice.	labels:After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it..
text:That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. The seeker  has feelings of depression because it's a gift from the creator. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences.	labels:It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that..
text:I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. The seeker  is scared in that family members are going through loss. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share that with friends.	labels:I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
text:Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. The seeker  feels stress because of the exam schedule and because he or she missed a call to see the psychiatrist. The supporter could tell the seeker to call the psychiatrist.	labels:I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. What would you like to discuss today?\nHi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried I. I'm next. The seeker  does not need to talk about next. The supporter should ask about the history of the layoffs.	labels:My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?
text:Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. The seeker  feels nervous about working on her new job. The supporter can tell the seeker to take some time to process the news and be with friends and family. The supporter could suggest the seeker to give advice to her friends and family.	labels:So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?
text:Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now. The seeker  feels nervous about job situation because they were put out of work at their company. The supporter could ask the seeker to meet with friends and tell them the feelings are not that bad. The supporter could also tell the seeker the feelings are not that bad. The supporter could also explain that the situation is not that bad and that the need for new employees is part of the reason why they are laid off.	labels:I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?
text:No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now. The seeker  does not feel happy about being laid off, but does feel worried about what will happen. The supporter could suggest that the seeker set up contingency plan for the future.	labels:Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.
text:Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. The seeker  is worried about a layoff. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for an opportunity to work so that the seeker does not feel unemployed.	labels:Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments.
text:I'm an owner. What kind of programs? The seeker  feels unemployed and worried about going out of state. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should look into renting an apartment. The supporter could also suggest making plans to travel to help to get out of the city.	labels:Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it.
text:oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion. The seeker  would be happy to help the supporter for a little bit on the housing situation. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the state does have a lot of programs to help with mortgage payments. The seeker can also provide a bit of detail on the state. The supporter could say that Utah .gov is the best state to look into if you are searching for a home.	labels:I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
text:yeah how can I make more money on the side? it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good. The seeker  asks to make more money on the side to help with rent. The supporter should try to help the seeker on whatever projects she can. In this conversation, the seeker is nervous about her job situation, but she is given a great suggestion for her to do.	labels:As there are a lot of people who've lost their jobs the pickins' are quite slim. But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.
text:oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays! The seeker  is very happy that her company laid off ten percent of the employees and her new job is starting to pay off. The supporter could tell the seeker that it makes sense to work, but there is some work to do. If the seeker wants to be more productive during the holidays, she could start a new job or try to apply in a different city.	labels:If it's in your area Instacart is also hiring shoppers and delivery drivers. Is that something you might be able to do?	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing today?\nHi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone. The seeker  feels hopeless because she is feeling sad and hopeless. The supporter could say that the seeker needs to talk to her friends and share her experience.	labels:I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
text:I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now. The seeker  feels worthless and mad at her boyfriend. The supporter could make a note of the seeker's state on the chat. The supporter could also look at the online chat history and chat history of the seeker to see how she reacted to the discussion.	labels:There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
text:I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? The seeker  feels hopeless because her boyfriend is not helping her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs professional help.	labels:It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
text:I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments.. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. The seeker  feels stuck because she feels that her life is not going to change. The supporter could suggest the seeker to make change and see if she will be able to get to the point of making a change.	labels:I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
text:What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. The seeker  feels stuck because she doesn't want to change her lifestyle. The supporter could suggest that the seeker set a smaller goal to improve her body and routine.	labels:Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
text:I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. The seeker  feels stumped by the large goals because they are unrealistic to be realistic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a Google calendar to follow a time schedule. The supporter could also create a new app to help with the tasks.	labels:How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
text:That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? The seeker  has not decided on the actual goal. The supporter should make sure she tries to make the goal.	labels:Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
text:Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now. The seeker  is positive about her situation and hopeful about it. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk to friends, share her experience and get in touch with a therapist to help her. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should spend time with her friends and family, as they are her friends.	labels:Great! I hope for the best for you!	episode_done:True
text:hi how's it going today?\nHello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. The seeker  feels happy and not guilty. The supporter can tell the seeker it is okay to feel depressed.	labels:i hear you. it has been a hard year. what's been the biggest challenge for you?
text:Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over.. The seeker  feels uncomfortable and unsure about how to get things done. The supporter could suggest questions that the seeker should ask her boyfriend or friends. The supporter could also suggest some questions to ask a friend.	labels:it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future?
text:Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. The seeker  feels frustrated because the supporter is asking her to be more realistic about the future. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to be more specific in the future.	labels:it's true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?
text:Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. The seeker  felt fear because of uncertainty. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to people who are more reliable sources of information. The supporter can also suggest the seeker to talk to friends and share stories. The supporter could also ask the seeker to seek professional therapy.	labels:it is like there's a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.
text:How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? The seeker  feels not being able to do things for herself. The supporter could suggest the seeker to focus on finding other things to do.	labels:the "little black rain cloud" people? LOLI try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it's our first.
text:Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? The seeker  feels positive about life. The supporter could tell the seeker that the things she feels are related to the past. The supporter could also tell the seeker to look for professional therapy.	labels:While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s.
text:I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. The seeker  is worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that things will not get better anytime soon. She could also ask the seeker to think about the things she can do to prevent the future disaster.	labels:The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012.
text:I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. The seeker  feels the anxiety of near disaster because of the end of the world. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of friends who are worried about the end of the world. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should join a study group or be aware of what is happening in the world.	labels:are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?
text:No but I did love that show as a kid. The seeker  feels stressed, but it is not mentioned that the supporter can help her. The supporter should say something to the seeker about being kind and remembering that.	labels:Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren't always helpful. anyone in particular for you?
text:My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things. The seeker  was very emotional about the family. The supporter could ask the seeker to put in some time for her family.	labels:so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.

The supporter should help the seeker to see that the furloughs are a real problem. The supporter could also discuss with her husband. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to friends and share similar experiences.	labels:Not exactly. Controlled breathing is more of getting yourself into a quiet room.

text:How can I help you today?\nHi there. I'm seeking some support, maybe some advice in dealing with a situation at my work. I've got a new supervisor who is so different from my last one. The seeker  does not say anything about her new supervisor and the supporter should not ask her anything about her new supervisor.	labels:Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one. What kinds of things are troubling to you?
text:Yes. They have a Military background and bark orders, and change the way I'm working without being open to conversation. When I ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they "Don't have to explain themselves!" as they are my supervisor. The seeker  feels threatened because she is told that the direction of her work is different from the direction of her previous supervisor. The supporter should remind the seeker that she has a new supervisor, and she can ask for more specifics.	labels:Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant.  Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?
text:Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also Military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great.. But my other co-worker is like me. Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to.. Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived. The seeker  felt that the work environment is hostile when they are just trying to continue projects that were started before they arrived. The supporter could remind the seeker that the co-workers respect each other, and there is a lot of respect between co-workers.	labels:That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.
text:Yea. But when he threatens and calls my insubordinate, I worry he might be making a case to remove me. I wonder if I should talk to the person above him, about it. But I worry they might just think I'm complaining because its different. But it really is uncomfortable. The seeker  feels the need to talk with the supervisor about her concerns. The supporter could tell the seeker to set up a time to talk with the supervisor.	labels:It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you.  Talking to someone above your supervisor may be a good solution. .
text:Its been 3 months since he started, I just wonder if its too soon. I'd hate to be seen as a complainer. And the person above him, is the person who hired him. The seeker  worries about losing her job. The supporter could suggest that she tell her supervisor about her concerns about the supervisor.	labels:When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.
text:Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people? The seeker  is worried about having a new job. The supporter should talk to the new supervisor about the situation.	labels:I see you really like your job.  Sometimes just taking a deep breath can help to calm stress. .
text:Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress. I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed? The seeker  feels stressed because she is worried about the boss. The supporter could also ask her to talk to a supervisor about his co-worker.	labels:Do you think he'll be receptive to your communications if you speak directly to him?
text:I think its worth a try, but I don't want him to think I'm being argumentative. Any suggestions on how to have that conversation? The seeker  is trying to speak to the supervisor. The supporter can tell her that they are listening. The supporter could also ask her to talk to someone else who has more experience in this situation.	labels:I can see that you worry about your boss seeing you as argumentative, but could you try it from the perspective of making your boss feel like he is in control?
text:Making it his idea. That's a good tactic. I could try that. And maybe giving him time to understand the workplace as it new to him too. The seeker  feels strong enough to speak directly with her boss. The supporter could suggest that the seeker give her boss a chance to understand the work environment, but still feel confident speaking directly with him.	labels:Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:I think you've given me some good advice. Thank you. I feel a little less anxious than I did. The seeker  felt less anxious than she did before the conversation.

text:I appreciate it! The seeker  feels less anxious and is excited about the opportunity to speak to her boss. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to the boss and express what she feels.	labels:I wish you well.
text:You too. Good bye! The seeker  is let down, but the supporter can tell the seeker that he or she can talk to the other person.	labels:Bye. Can you please press finish if you are feeling better.	episode_done:True

The supporter could give the seeker some information about unemployment assistance.	labels:These days all of us have this situation. I can assure you that your family can understand it. How about an online job?
text:Yes,it just very frustrating. My family member has taken another restaurant job only to lose it again for the same reasons, COVID.. They have been going to temp services also.. The seeker  was upset about losing a job. The supporter should give the seeker feedback about what she can do to help her family member get another job.	labels:I also worked in a coffee house and it has been closed for this damn virus. I feel sad too. But we should go on.
text:The job center's can only help so much. And if they don't have internet skills,then online jobs will help.. The seeker  feels herself feel alone and that she has to get help. The supporter could suggest to ask the seeker to go to a coffee shop or to turn to online job site.	labels:This sounds good.
text:So this family member gave up their apartment, moved back in with family, still fighting unemployment and going to food banks. It's crazy. They are doing what they can but when we talk about it, it's hard to believe in these modern times we are in such a mess. The seeker  has lost her apartment, but the supporter can help her. The supporter could also suggest a new job center.	labels:I wish this virus ends soon. But believe me everyone have similar situation these days. Did they try any online job?
text:No online computer skills, but they now learned where to get some basic training. The seeker  is sad about losing her apartment. The supporter should tell the seeker to do something about it. The supporter could also ask her if her family member is in a similar situation.	labels:This sounds good. Wish to learn soon. I am mourning for my grandpa and my uncle that they gone for the Covid.

text:Yes and I wish you a good thanksgiving holiday.. The seeker  is thanked by the supporter and feels better. The supporter is happy to listen and help.	labels:You too.	episode_done:True
text:I am very upset. The seeker  feels upset about feeling like she is going to lose her job. The supporter could answer the seeker's reasons with the following.	labels:Hello, how are you doing today? Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?
text:A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday. The seeker  feels upset because of the friend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try to get some support from friends, family and school.	labels:Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?
text:Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income. The seeker  feels upset about her friend's opinion about her money. The supporter should ask the seeker to tell her why she feels upset.	labels:That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?
text:I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong. The seeker  feels hurt because of what the friend said. The supporter should suggest to the seeker that the friend would be willing to help the seeker with her family situation. The supporter could also help her in her own situation.	labels:Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?.
text:No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship. The seeker  feels like the support really does not understand her situation and she is not confident about the situation. She feels uncomfortable about her situation. The supporter could suggest the seeker to call someone and talk with her, but she should also tell her friend.	labels:Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?
text:Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore. The seeker  feels hurt by the friend's judgment. The supporter could suggest that the friend think about how she has treated the seeker over the years and how she is treating the seeker today. The supporter could also suggest to ask her how she treats others.	labels:I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.
text:That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now. The seeker  is being hurtful. The supporter could tell the seeker to stop acting so in self defense.	labels:Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nHello, I'm feeling very anxious about my classes. How are you? The seeker  feels anxious about the classes, but the supporter should give the seeker some support. The supporter could tell the seeker that the classes can be stressful. The supporter could also have the seeker focus on their dedication to the class.	labels:I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful.
text:Yeah, especially with the pandemic, it's just been so hard to try and focus. The seeker  feels anxious about the school, but does not share that. The supporter could say that the seeker could have a different activity in the school at the time. The supporter could also ask a student to talk about the stress in their life.	labels:I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this.
text:Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far. The seeker  is stressed. The supporter should also help the seeker so that she has some strategies for boosting her anxiety. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar strategies.	labels:Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.
text:I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? The seeker  feels stressed because of the tests. The supporter should suggest the seeker to add a new page of notes to the computer and start writing, which will not only help the seeker feel more comfortable and relaxed, but will help the supporter understand the seeker's thoughts.	labels:Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.
text:I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class. The seeker  feels stressed about her classes because the supportive supporter tells her that she's working on making notes better. The supporter could also tell the seeker to spend the night in a safe place.	labels:I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)
text:I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? The seeker  is angry at having to wake up at 5AM. The supporter can use any common alarm on your phone or computer to wake you up. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker start the day with a light breakfast and maybe a glass of water.	labels:That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.
text:Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. The seeker  has tried to set a loud ringtone, but after waking up, she finds that it is too annoying. The supporter could suggest the seeker to put it on a different alarm clock, so that the seeker can wake up before it.	labels:What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.
text:I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. The seeker  feels anxious about her schedule and her personal time. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do something to make her more organised. The supporter could also suggest to wake up earlier and wake up a little earlier than the scheduled time.	labels:That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.
text:Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot. The seeker  feels stressed, but it is not mentioned. The supporter could also ask for more details about the reason for being stressed. The supporter should also ask the seeker to think about the reason why she is stressed.	labels:I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!	episode_done:True

text:i have gone to her home.her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it. The seeker  has gone to her mother home to discuss with the mother. The supporter should ask the seeker more about her mother.	labels:I understand , so now forget from beng guilty.
text:but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire. The seeker  feels guilty about cheating and has gone to her mother to tell her. The supporter could respond to this by to suggest to the seeker to give up and confess everything. If the seeker is honest, then the supporter should encourage her to confess.	labels:You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her.
text:but think about her mom how could i handle her. The seeker  feels guilty because of her boyfriend's behaviors. She is worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk with friends to find about her boyfriend's actions. The supporter could also tell the seeker about a friendship who has a nice girlfriend.	labels:Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.
text:yes im going to warn her. The seeker  is worried about her girlfriend because her girlfriend parent's are not telling her everything. The supporter could tell the seeker that if the girlfriend knows about the incident, then she could be afraid of what the girlfriend will do to the seeker.	labels:You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish.
text:yeah i can understand. The seeker  is feeling guilty and worried about her behavior with her girlfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to tell her mom about the incident. It was a mistake. I totally understand.	labels:And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake , so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy :)
text:sure i will try to solve my problem. The seeker  is told the truth, but does not accept the truth. The supporter should try to make the seeker think in a positive way.	labels:Thats the spirit :)
text:give any tips to warn her my friend. The seeker  is pleased with the listener's advice.

IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do.

And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.
text:oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person? The seeker  feels shy. The supporter should suggest that the seeker set up a meeting with her friends first.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to ask friends to be in her life if this is the reason of stress.	labels:When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease.

Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all.
text:yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas.

It sounds as though you are very hard on yourself. From a practical standpoint, you could try talking about your grades with your professors and have a discussion about how to improve your grades..
text:Thank you.  That has helped in the past, so I think perhaps they could give me some guidance as well. The seeker  feels stressed about her grades. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should have a friend go for a walk before the day starts.

I have found a few things I do to keep myself from being to worried and depressed. They help a lot.
text:It isn't, but I guess it's because they don't really know what *depression* feels like. Really? What do you do? Maybe they could help me. The seeker  is confused about being depressed and not knowing what depression feels like. The supporter could tell the seeker that depression is not a bad thing.	labels:True, many people do not understand depression. I actually have found it easier to find a person who DOES understand and not talk to those who don't. When I talk to those who don't, it brings me down, so I find a good friend I can confide in. I can understand being discouraged to and not knowing who will understand you..
text:Yes!! Talking to someone who doesn't know what it feels like REALLY makes me depressed! I'm wondering if it is the pandemic that is making me feel worse?

text:I have a friend who did get it and almost died. He is 40 and pretty healthy. His wife and daughter got it too. They just had flu-like symptoms, but he was in the hospital for 9 days. That was almost 3 months ago and he is still feeling the effects of it. The seeker  is feeling discouraged and worried about getting flu. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should get more motivation by going to the gym, go to the doctor, and go to the doctor.	labels:So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you.  And of course, pray.  The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and I still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so I try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.

The seeker  feels that she is going down the rabbit hole with her thoughts. The supporter could suggest that she ask for help to make better choices.	labels:I'm almost 60 and my husband is 66. We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but I believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around! Well, I hope I have encouraged you..
text:Yes, I think walking, changing my thoughts, praying, and taking care of myself will really help. Yes! You've really helped me out. I just turned 64 and my husband is 69. He is really, really healthy because he takes care of himself so well.. He has a handicapped younger sister and he always wanted to be around to take care of her. So he has always taken care of himself! Thanks so much! The seeker  feels inspired to walk. The supporter should discuss with the seeker what it is like to walk, what it is like to accompany someone who is walking and what it feels like to walk with someone who is in a wheelchair.	labels:So we are about the same age then!

The supporter could say that the seeker is going to seek help.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. my friend lost his job about 6 months ago and he was also feeling a similar way.

text:At the moment, good. I need help! These people.....I don't understand.... The seeker  feels nervous about the support person. The supporter should try to motivate the seeker.	labels:I hear that they don't understand, can you explain further. Can you tell me more?
text:My co-workers feel that this whole pandemic thing is a government conspiracy to lessen the overpopulation in this world. It really hurts me cause I have people who have passed due to this. THIS IS REAL!! The seeker  feels distressed by the whole pandemic thing, but the supporter can help. The supporter could suggest the seeker to help her friends by sharing the worries and fears. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker find help.	labels:There are a lot of people who are struggling and it is clearly a very upsetting time for you..

Maybe the supporter could talk to the seeker about a breathing therapy.	labels:So you are frustrated because others are not using masks, have I got that right?
text:It's not that they are not using masks, it is their position and reasons not to wear the masks and that puts others in a scary and anxious position at their workplace where in these times, work is scare. What is your point of view on masks? The seeker  feels frustrated and anxious about mask use. The supporter is supportive.	labels:Just from talking to you, I can feel how anxious you are and this is made worse by your colleagues, perhaps they are struggling in different ways with this.
text:Yes they are....we need to make things different for everyone in the workplace but not on peoples health. The seeker  feels anxious about her colleagues. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is not the job to be a mask wearer. The supporter could link that saying to what the seeker is worried about being a mask wearer.	labels:There are guidelines on how work places should be handling the COVID issue. Has your manager gone through any guidelines with the team?
text:Yes he has and is going to go over it on Monday with all of us and we should come to an agreement. The seeker  feels anxious because of the COVID issue. The supporter could help the seeker by showing that there is a strategy to deal with the anxiety. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to talk to a friend and ask them to talk to the friend.	labels:That seems like a really good time to go through how you feel.

text:My friend has been quiet and non responsive for some time and I'm starting to worry about them. This is a pretty recent thing, ever since lockdown. The seeker  worries about the friend. The supporter could tell the seeker to push her friend out of her life.	labels:Is this a close friend of yours that you would normally speak to every day or see on a regular basis?
text:Yes that's correct, however with lockdown I haven't seen any friends for a long time face to face. The seeker  does not have friends, but does know someone close to her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should set up a contact.	labels:Ok so you have are close friend, who you used to engage with regularly and now you are worried because when you try and contact them, they aren't responding.

The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to a friend or a friend of friends.	labels:I can tell that you feel a lot for your friend and it shows that you care about lot about them.

The supporter can tell the seeker to try and contact the friend to give her some comfort and details.

Have you tried reaching out to their family members as they may have a loser handle on how this person is feeling at the moment?
text:I actually haven't. I'm not that close to their family to be honest so I'm not quite sure how to do that? The seeker  is concerned about her friend. The supporter should ask if they are concerned about the situation and if they are concerned, how can they help.	labels:You could try reaching out to friends on Facebook or social media, you can find contact details for them that way and perhaps send them a direct message. You are a concerned friend which means they probably wouldn't mind if you did get in touch.
text:I didn't think about contacting family that way. That's a good suggestion.. The seeker  wants to get in touch with family members. The supporter could suggest the seeker to contact a friend and ask for a help.	labels:I had a friend once that was acting out of character. They weren't quiet but I could tell them here was something different in the way they were acting etc. It turns out that they had started a new relationship with another friend of mine and didn't want anyone else to know. In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.
text:Perhaps I am worried about nothing and your experience does make sense. I may be reading too much into these things but you read about people's mental health being affected by COVID isolation these days. The seeker  was worried about someone she did not know. The supporter could encourage the seeker to share his own experiences and the reason.	labels:That is true. Mental health issues have increased  significantly since lockdowns began. As they are not responding to your attempts to get in touch, you could think has anything else changed for them other than lockdown, for example are they busier at work? have childcare commitments? Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.
text:That is true. I think they are probably very busy at the moment but as they are typically so outgoing it did strike me as odd. What else would you suggest? The seeker  is worried about her friend and wants to know if they are busier. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should reach out to a friend of hers that knows her friend better and ask them to get in touch.	labels:You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group. This might appeal to your friend and they may see this as a fun activity to get involved in.
text:I think I'll give that a try. Maybe they don't have time but a fun relaxing group chat might be the way forward. Thanks for this suggestion. I'll give this a go. The seeker  is worried about not being able to reach out to other friends. The supporter could say that the seeker is worried about not having time.

The supporter could tell the seeker to do something to help the seeker and to talk to her friends.	labels:I know, this year was stressful for everyone in our planet, so you are not alone. What's the worst scenario do you think will happen?
text:I know, but I am the only one in the family making money and we need this job. My wife was laid off earlier this year. If I'm laid off, we can't afford our home. We are already dipping into savings because my wife lost her job. The seeker  feels stressed and worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can work on her strategies and strategies for her job.	labels:Did you try searching for new jobs?
text:I tried and had a couple of interviews but the response was pretty much "you're too experienced" or "we have cheaper applicants than you". Obviously not that direct but reading between the lines you know? The seeker  is not sure if she will get a job. The supporter should ask about other job opportunities and what she is looking for.	labels:Hmmmm, First of all stop being panicked, You still have your job.
text:I guess so. I can't help feeling a sense of dread though like I'm next. The seeker  feels apprehensive and worried about the next round of job. The supporter could be of the same opinion. Also the supporter could tell the seeker to think about what a good career path is and what that does.	labels:The good thing is you anticipate losing your job, so you have the advantage here.
text:How so? The seeker  feels dread and is looking for a job. The supporter could suggest that the seeker take a job in the future.	labels:You can prepare yourself for that! yes, as simple as this. Search for new jobs, get help from your wife and friends.

text:I've been searching for the past month. It's just been so hard trying to break through to an interview. The seeker  feels stressed from the interview, but is not sure if she is next. The supporter could tell the seeker to go back to her home to relax and do other things.	labels:Help in searching for jobs and supporting you emotionally.
text:It's been frustrating. I've sent out 50 resumes and got 3 interviews. The seeker  is confused about whether she will be successful in finding new jobs. The supporter should help her prepare for the interview.	labels:Let me be straight ok? you somehow don't have any other options but searching. You can do it! who knows! maybe you will get a better job.
text:Do you have any tips? It just seems I can't find a thng. thing. The seeker  has no other options except to search for new jobs. The supporter may suggest to the seeker to call her husband to make sure he is not feeling stressed and worrying about job situation. The supporter could also ask the seeker about her husband's feelings about being laid off.	labels:Look at this situation as an opportunity, you still have your job and you can search for even a better job.
text:Yes, that's what I've been trying to do. I just can't find anything. Or get my foot in the door anywhere. The seeker  is in a precarious position. Taking a job is a goal, but she is not sure if she can achieve it. She doesn't know if she will be able to afford her financial situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to start taking a job.	labels:Don't get disappointed, put effort, seek new methods for searching, research online.
text:Do you know any new methods for searching? The seeker  is frustrated because he didn't get any new job. The supporter could offer something like idea to go out and look for a job. The supporter could also talk about a game with a friend or another person who can help the seeker.	labels:Ask around locally, maybe there is an organization locally for support in this pandemic situation.
text:Yeah that's been a problem. With cuts in the budget my local resource center is closed down. Anyway I know you tried your best. Thanks for listening. The seeker  has been stressed and worried about her job, so the supporter could take her to another organization that helps people with similar circumstances. The supporter could explain that the organization is not a part of the organization at work, but a private business and that the organization is manually searching for job openings. The supporter could also say that the organization is a company that helps people with job searching.	labels:I hope I could help a little.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker  is greeted by the supporter. The supporter could ask the seeker to write some thank you notes for the supporter.	labels:Hello, how are you today?

I'm getting really nervous about this because I think I need longer to prepare. The seeker  feels nervous and worried about this interview and financial situation. She is not sure if she needs longer to prepare. The supporter could mention that she is struggling financially.	labels:I know how you feel, I have often felt anxiety before a job interview.. What makes you feel that you are unprepared?
text:The thing is I'm really good at interviews but usually it takes time to prepare. It's a corporate interview so I need to prepare behavioural answers to certain scenarios. In the past this has taken me a week to learn and record to memory. The seeker  feels nervous about the interview, the interviewer is nervous about the answer he/she gets. The supporter could suggest the seeker to make an example test to make sure that the interviewer does not get nervous.	labels:Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses? That could possibly speed up your preparation time.
text:Yes perhaps. I need to draw on previous experience so I think I'll need to prepare. I'm just so busy at work these days I just don;t think I'll have the time. The seeker  felt nervous about the job interview and the mentor. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to do a good job at the interview and hope that the seeker will get a positive result.	labels:I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?
text:Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it? Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work. The seeker  feels stressed about work situation because of the time constraint. The supporter could say to the seeker that she should come to work early or leave early. The supporter could say the following:	labels:Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?
text:Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. The seeker  feels nervous because of not being able to think of anything different. The supporter should explain the time pressure and what the seeker can do to delay or remove the commitments.	labels:That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems. You seem like a hard working, diligent type of person that can make this work if you make the effort.
text:Tanks , I think I need to stay positive about this. Not sure how to handle my interview nerves however? The seeker  is feeling nervous and worries about her interview nerves. The supporter could give the seeker a list of things that can help her. The supporter could also tell the seeker to take some time off from work to get more motivation.	labels:Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help. If you prepare as much as possible in the time that you have, you can be confident that you have done your best, and that is all that matters. You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?
text:There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually! The seeker  is told that she should prepare for the interview by picturing her interviewer in their underwear. The supporter could also tell the seeker that it is a good idea to prepare for the interview. The supporter could also suggest some of the things that the seeker could do to help her prepare.	labels:Be confident in your abilities. You are the right person for the job, and if the interviewer does not see that, it is their failing, not yours. You will do great.
text:Thanks for that. I think the key to this is confidence so I'll go with it. Feeling more relaxed about it all now, The seeker  felt confident about her interview and what she hopes to do. The supporter could encourage the seeker to be more confident about her interview.	labels:Excellent. I am very happy to hear that. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:No that's great. Thanks from your help. The seeker  gets positive feedback because it is easier to stay positive about the situation. The supporter could also give the seeker a hug.	labels:You are quite welcome. It was a pleasure speaking with you. Have a great day.	episode_done:True

The seeker  realizes that he is not feeling so good about the situation, but the supporter could tell the seeker that she can work on it.	labels:If he says he trusts you I am sure that he does. He would not have asked you to work with him if he did not..
text:very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn't see me cuz he was busy. now he's asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me. The seeker  does not have a romantic interest in the supporter. The supporter should ask the seeker if there is any other reason for this fear.	labels:That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?
text:confused! i'll know sooner or later what he wants. thing is i was hanging out with his friends recently who had wanted to sleep with me. he knew it and didn't like it. he liked it when i stopped talking to them. The seeker  feels confused because she hangs out with her friends. The supporter could suggest that she try to talk to her friends about it.	labels:How does this relate to him asking you to be on the board with him?.

The seeker  feels confused about the situation because he was hanging out with his friends. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to his friends first.	labels:It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this.

text:yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear. The seeker  understands that he is not sure what his intentions are with her. The supporter could ask the seeker to have a conversation with a friend.	labels:I realise that this must be difficult but isn't it best to get things out into the open?.
text:it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face. The seeker  is hurt by this situation, but the supporter can help her by explaining the situation and giving her a boost of motivation. The supporter could encourage the seeker to keep talking to this person and try to get information from him.	labels:I think it might be best for you to make a clean break. It sounds like you are being manipulated..
text:possibly. i'd prob be better being away from the situation. The seeker 's fear of being manipulated is increased by the supporter's statement that you are being manipulated.	labels:Certainly you would be. I know that it is hard but you will feel better in the long run..
text:I think I would. I tried to break away once but they asked me to come back. i feel there are benefits to it also. The seeker  felt hurt, but the problem is not mentioned. The supporter could tell the seeker that he or she did not know if the seeker would stay.	labels:You need to be aware that that can and will happen. Ignore it. What sort of benefits do you feel that there are?
text:it gives me an upper edge and more clout. The seeker  is feeling empowered and feel they have an upper edge in front of people. The supporter can explain what benefits there are and have the seeker talk about these. Then the supporter can ask the seeker to talk to more people in the community to get more motivation.	labels:In what way does it do that?.
text:being on the board gives me perks. The seeker  feels more advantage about being on the board because that would be better for her. The supporter could tell the seeker that adding the board to her work schedule will give her more clout.	labels:Do you feel that perhaps you might be using him just a little bit?.
text:yes and i think he is using me to a degree also. The seeker  feels manipulated by the supporter.	labels:Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there's an element of mutual manipulation.
text:yes. The seeker  feels confused and has doubts about her feelings for him. The supporter can tell the seeker that there are other people in the world that love him, but she is not them. The supporter should ask the seeker to consider that.	labels:You are definitely not the only person to feel this way!.
text:it's a difficult situation. i think it will become clearer the deeper i get into it. thing is he is the head of the board and holds the power. what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me. The seeker  feels confused. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should go back to being friends with her boyfriend. It is best to let the seeker tell the supporter what she feels. The supporter could also talk to the seeker to help her understand that a relationship with her boyfriend is not for her.	labels:I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board..
text:i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment. The seeker  feels an upper edge, but the supporter is not willing to give her support. She may feel that she has been manipulated by the seeker.	labels:But that is rather manipulative of you..
text:if you were me you would forget about him and the board. The seeker  feels manipulated by the supporter. She feels that the board has the power and the supporter is just a part of it. She wants to be closer to the supporter and this is why she is asking to be on the board.	labels:Yes I definitely would do that..
text:thing is he is encouraging me to be like that. cuz it helps him too. okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it. The seeker  feels that she needs to be patient and work with the situation.

text:yes but it's less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense. The seeker  is being manipulated by her boyfriend. The supporter could ask her to stop the manipulation and leave the relationship.	labels:Ah I hear you. You feel that your options are rather more limited than previously because of the lockdown?.
text:yes. The seeker  feels that there are fewer options and is worried about her options. The supporter could ask the seeker to think more about the situation and leave.	labels:That is something I believe that most of us are feeling right now so I sympathise..
text:true. i just have to be strong about it with him. even if he likes me i don't think it's a healthy relationship. i slept with one of his friends and the other one wanted to sleep with me too. The seeker  feels less vulnerable because she has a friend and wants to sleep with him. The supporter could suggest the seeker to write a letter about this situation and the reasons for it.	labels:I can tell that you really have deep reservations and know deep down that this is not a healthy place for you to be. Is he aware that this happened?.
text:yes when it comes down to it. he suspected it happened. his friend asked the one i slept with if it was true. he denied it. so i think he suspected it. The seeker  feels that he is being manipulated. The supporter should help the seeker to clarify what this means.	labels:Do you feel guilty about this?.

The seeker  feels guilty because she thinks she is being manipulated by her boyfriend. The supporter could tell her that she is being manipulated by her boyfriend, but she should not feel guilty about it.	labels:Do you feel that you want to get revenge on him?.

text:Hi there. How are you doing today?\nI'm  good. Getting cold outside. Temp dropping over 20 degrees. Brr. The seeker  feels nervous about getting cold outside in a warm environment but the supporter could encourage her to take a few jackets or wimpy sweaters.	labels:Yes, I know! It's supposed to snow this week where I am.  So, I understand you are in need of someone to talk to. What's going on.
text:Oh no, I hate driving in the snow. Spun out one year- rather not drive in snow- at least when it's icy. My interest rate hit another credit card. Have to pay $80 more a month now. Hoping to find more work so I can pay it off faster. The seeker  feels nervous about driving in the snow because the supporter could say that the seeker is afraid of getting stranded. The supporter could also say that the supporter is worried about getting stranded in the snow.	labels:Ah, so if I understand you correctly, your interest rate has increased, so you need to find another job to pay it off?
text:yeah cuz it was a no interest rate card and that expired so it started charging interest. I knew it was coming but need to work more hours now. The interest I pay every month will go down as I pay more of the principal off. I just hate it. The seeker  states she is in need of a job. The supporter should explain what the inability to find a job is. The supporter could also explain that she is in need of help.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Are you feeling stressed out about it?
text:Yes and no. Cuz I know I will pay it off within 3 years at the most. Probably closer to two years. I just don't like to wait and want to pay it off sooner if possible. The seeker  feels stressed because she has to wait 3 years for money. The supporter could suggest her to start paying down the debt.	labels:I understand exactly how you feel. When I finished school, I wanted to pay off my student loans as soon as possible. I'm glad to hear that you are not too stressed about it though.

The seeker  feels stressed because of her debt. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not too stressed about her debt because she will pay it off within 3 years.	labels:I heard about Biden's plans as well! Luckily, I paid all of my debts already but I think it will be great for other people. Perhaps if you are unable to find another job to reduce the principal, you could try setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards the amount owed?
text:maybe they will reimburse you on what you paid. I could if i really discipline myself to. The seeker  feels stressed and worried that her debts are not going to be paid. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to help her with her debt problem. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she can set aside a certain amount of money each month and remind it to come back to her.	labels:It's just a thought. Alternatively, I'm not sure if you typically get money for birthdays and the winter holidays, but you could commit some of that amount towards your principal amount.
text:I get some but I spend the money on myself- like chocolate! itll prob take me 2-3 years to pay it off. if i go too much into discrectionary money i feel deprived.

But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don't know and it just boggles on my mind. The seeker 's worries about the second wave are the same as the seeker's worries about the first wave. The supporter should remind the seeker of the second wave and how it can cause her anxieties.	labels:Yes I understand, I'm from the east coast and I'm deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown..
text:I get that there's a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first wave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don't think they should be doing that too much. The seeker  does not understand why people are not out and about. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get out more.	labels:I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can't change the situation because it human nature..
text:it is. And that's sad but true. It's in our nature, as you say.

The seeker  feels abandoned. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are no right reasons to be on the east coast or to go out.	labels:However, we shouldn't let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.
text:yes I agree also. It's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. The seeker  is feeling upset because she has been feeling nervous and stressed. The supporter could advise by sharing how she dealt with this.	labels:Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.

Aim is to distress yourself..
text:yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enough time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that's good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. The seeker  is being stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should answer more specific questions.	labels:I'm on the same boat. Build yourself a well structure schedule and aim to follow it.

text:so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self-imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time-management, etc. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.

Maybe something is going on with her she doesnt want to share. Or possibly even she is trying to share but doesnt know how.
text:I guess that could be the case. What should I do then? The seeker  feels negative about her friend because she does not want to share her opinion. The supporter could help the seeker to talk about these problems with her friend.	labels:Perhaps try to reach out and see if anything is wrong.
text:So I should just ask her if something is going on? The seeker  does not know if something is wrong with her friend and the supporter should try to find out.

The seeker  felt that doordash was not working because she was struggling to make money. The supporter could suggest that she should contact her employer, who could offer her a better work situation.	labels:That is rough. The unemployment system has been very slow during COVID, so I completely understand your frustration and worry. I am glad to hear that you are doing door dash, even if you aren't making a lot that is still something!
text:ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can't really go out after dark, and I'm worried I'm driving it too much and it's going to break down.

The supporter could suggest to the seeker to go out at night, listen to the music and have a night out.	labels:If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX (which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work. I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop, you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible. Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee.

The supporter can offer advice and support for the seeker. The supporter could also offer the seeker to volunteer.	labels:That is reasonable.  And it sounds like you are doing all you can.

The seeker  seems stressed, but the supporter is confident that the seeker is going to be able to do well, that the seeker will be able to do the job.	labels:yeah, people are not social distancing enough.. but wearing a mask and then using sanitizer should at least give us a bit of a confidence.
text:like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks! it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information.

text:too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. The seeker  is told to contact the mayor's office to request for restrictions on events. The supporter can also suggest that the seeker should reach out to a teacher to tell them what is happening in the city and to seek guidance from a teacher.	labels:hmm, that's a bummer.

The supporter could suggest a question to ask the friend to help her feel comfortable.	labels:yeah, i can understand.. do you have any hobbies or interests that you can work on to help you put your mind away for sometime?

text:and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated. okay yeah good idea. I can look for more videos too on such resources. like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project. The seeker  feels lonely and has difficulty sleeping at night. The supporter could suggest the seeker to watch a movie or listen to a podcast to help her sleep.	labels:putting away my phone has helped me a lot. also, i have designed a daily routine to include more of the tasks that i like.

So you have no contact withim what so ever?
text:No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone. The seeker  feels disgusted by not having contact. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is a good example of communication failure.	labels:Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back..

text:I guess we are all in the same boat. The seeker  feels stressed because of the economic downturn. The supporter could suggest that the seeker read a book or watch a movie.	labels:Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. .
text:I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged. The seeker  feels anxious because of the news. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get more information, such as a Facebook page, to have a more active life.	labels:Or constantly terrified. We can't control the world, or even another person really, but we can control ourselves. .
text:How do you comfort yourself that it's not that bad? The seeker  feels relieved. The supporter can fill in the gaps as to how to comfort the seeker.	labels:Well, I don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all.  But I do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.
text:Thanks for your insights. It is helpful to talk it out. The seeker  is comforted by the supportive supporter. The supporter can encourage the seeker to talk it out and try to find a way to get through the anxiety.	labels:And I schedule my day, even though I'm working and going to school from home.  I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing. .
text:Now is the time to focus and be disciplined.. I will take your advice. The seeker  tried to feel stressed about the future and the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk about another person instead.	labels:A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating. .
text:Yes, the short days are a major depressant. I feel like those around me dont understand my anxiety. The seeker  feels anxious that there are not enough sunshine in the world. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is a way to make the sun-light a little brighter.	labels:That must be frustrating.  I've learned there are just some people I can't trust with my vulnerabilities. .
text:I may overtrust. The seeker  is listening to the supporter and is sure that the supporter is right. The supporter should try to reassure the seeker that they are not being unfair. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk with friends and share experiences.	labels:But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it. .
text:You're good at this. Thanks for your support. Ending chat when timer allows. The seeker  feels like she trusts people and has to tell people that she is worried about the future.

The supporter should offer her advice and encourage the seeker to be positive and positive with her thoughts and feelings. It is helpful to remind the supporter that it may be a few days before the next review.	labels:sure, please go ahead and share your story.
text:pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now. The seeker  feels stressed. The supporter can suggest that the seeker do some physical activity to relax. The supporter could also make sure that the seeker is eating healthy during the day so that she is not always to stressed.	labels:it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?
text:yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc. The seeker  has a day of stress, but the supporter does not mention it. This is the perfect time to discuss the issue with the supporter and ask for more details.	labels:that's great! Friends can be big help.
text:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. The seeker  feels depressed because she did not get enough sleep. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should focus on her health and her stress management.	labels:If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.
text:So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. The seeker  acknowledges her difficulties with the daily walk. The supporter should ask her to talk about her path.	labels:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.
text:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym. The seeker  is not ready to change to walk. The supporter could suggest the seeker to spend time outdoors and have a walk in the park.	labels:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.
text:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. The seeker  is angry about being punished for doing what she is doing. The supporter should help to clarify the seeker's feelings. The seeker could suggest a different approach by herself. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is going to stand up for herself and support her.	labels:I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.
text:But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too. sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. The seeker  feels guilty because of the pandemic and having to go to the same place everyday. The supporter could ask the seeker to go to a study group or do something else to help her. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to take out her frustrations on someone else.	labels:that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.
text:yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. The seeker  feels guilty about not being able to handle the stress, but the supporter could tell the seeker to talk about her friends and family. The supporter could also tell the seeker she is to go out with her friends and go to the movies, or go out with friends when it isn't safe for anyone.	labels:I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.
text:And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good. The seeker  feels lonelier and claustrophobic. The supporter could tell the seeker to go outside and organize some outdoor activities to get rid of the feeling. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to check out a doctor or a therapist to get help.	labels:I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.
text:And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up. Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this. The seeker  feels lonelier than before. The supporter could use the seeker to explain the reason to why she feels lonelier. The supporter could also ask the seeker to come up with a solution to the lonliness. The supporter could also tell the seeker the reason to get through the lonliness.	labels:it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.
text:So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings. The seeker  feels renewed hope because of feeling that her city is finally closing its doors. The supporter could give the seeker a hug and an update about the city.	labels:I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.
text:So thank you for that and for listening and understanding. Yes will continue to do that. The seeker  feels renewed hope and is reminded of the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing the right thing. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she has a smile on her face.	labels:It was nice talking to you too.	episode_done:True

The supporter could mention that the seeker needed to find an apartment to get by for the upcoming holiday.	labels:Hello, how are you doing?
text:I am hanging in there as well as I can be. The seeker  feels happy about getting but not too happy about being able to do.	labels:What's been going on?
text:I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous. The seeker  feels anxious because she's worried about job situation. The supporter should talk to her about career goals and what they entail.	labels:It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.
text:It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that. The seeker  feels nervous about losing her job, but she is not sure if she is a good candidate for the job. The supporter could tell the seeker to keep a positive mindset and to look for other opportunities.	labels:Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.
text:Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability. The seeker  feels that the anxiety is from the uncertain job situation and the uncertainty of the future. The supporter should take the seeker's concerns and commit to finding solutions to the problems.	labels:I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?
text:Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.. The seeker  has heard a good story and is worried about losing his job. The supporter could tell him that there are plenty of employment opportunities in the city.	labels:I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.
text:I would hope so. The seeker  is saying that she thinks that she will be able to find a job after she finds employment. The supporter could suggest that the seeker attend meetings and talk to people. The supporter could also help the seeker with a resume and get the right career goals.	labels:I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.
text:Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away. The seeker  feels lonely and worried about losing her job. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should talk to her friends and her community. The supporter could also ask her for advice. In this conversation, the seeker feels worried about losing her job. The supporter could also tell the seeker to be reasonable about her job situation.	labels:I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.
text:For the record, you are doing a really really good job. I really appreciate your time and kind words. Thank you for empathizing and relating. I appreciate your assistance. I feel a lot better about this now :). The seeker  feels better about job and going home. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask someone to help the seeker find something to work on. The supporter could also ask the seeker to look for a job at a company that is not as stressful.	labels:You are very welcome. (: It's my pleasure to help in any way I can.	episode_done:True

text:It's 2020 so there's been a lot going on, but I've been struggling with this before all of that. 2020 has made it much worse though. The seeker  does not say anything. The supporter could tell her to talk to a psychiatrist or a therapist about the depression.	labels:I am sorry you feel this way. Do you live with friends or family?
text:I live on my own... well at least as the only human. I have a dog. The seeker  feels depressed about her situation. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could ask the seeker to put on a happy face and remind her of her dog and friends.	labels:That is great that you at least have your dog. They're great companion.
text:She is amazing and my love and joy. On days I feel I cannot get out of bed and I don't have work, I get up for her. The seeker  feels depressed because she feels alone. The supporter could do the same.	labels:How about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?
text:I wish. We haven't had the time recently to connect due to being so busy. Do you have any tips or ticks for things I can do by myself? The seeker  feels stressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have time to play with her dog.	labels:Of course. Now that covid is closing everything. You can use that time to take a course online for free. Or you can pursue your hobbies.
text:Right. Online courses are fun. The seeker  shows that she is going to be alone, but the supporter can tell that she is struggling over her dog. The supporter can suggest her to go to dog adoption to find one that is more suitable for her.	labels:Have you tried seeking therapist?
text:I need to. I just haven't had the money to see one. They're expensive. The seeker  is fearful about the future of their job. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should seek the help of a professional therapist.	labels:I think there are quite a few hotline for free, obviously not as good as your personal one, however you can use that when you need to talk to an expert.
text:Yeah.... The seeker  feels stressed, but the reasons behind that stress is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand how you feel, I also find myself more depressed this year than ever.
text:2020 has not been fun to say the least. I am hoping 2021 is a much better year. Thank you for listening to me. The seeker  feels depressed and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has been depressed recently. The supporter could also tell the seeker to remember that it's a different time from her past and not to feel bad about it.	labels:Me too, I have been trying to teach myself the "one day at a time" mindset to not being paranoid about the future.	episode_done:True
text:hi. The seeker  looks at the supporter and the supporter is unsure of the seeker's identity. The supporter should suggest the seeker to talk to his or her friends. The supporter could also ask the seeker to join a study group to get more motivation.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:im good. getting tired. had a long day. hola? The seeker  feels tired, but the reason is not given. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some time off to rest. The supporter could also say that she needs to do some research to find out how she can better fit into her work.	labels:It sounds like you worked really hard today. How are you taking care of yourself?
text:im good. just talked to my friend who is going in for heart surgery next week. The seeker  has a friend talking about her situation and is doing so well. The supporter could ask questions about the friend's condition. One of the questions could be to see if the seeker has any symptoms of heart disease.	labels:That must be really hard. I'm glad that you were able to make time for your friend who is going through a difficult time.
text:thank ya. yeah it's important im there for him right now. he has to be nervous. they're going to open 4 or 5 valves. The seeker  feels carefull because she is there for him. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do the same thing with her friend.	labels:It sounds like you are handling the situation well, given the stressful circumstance. What are some things you are doing to cope with this difficult situation?
text:thank ya. nothing that much different. i told my sister about it. she seems understanding about it. The seeker  feels relieved and thinks that she is coping well. The supporter should tell the seeker that she should be prepared for the possibility of heart surgery.	labels:It's wonderful that you have a support network that you trust and that you can talk with about this. I know that talking through things is really helpful for me too. Have you considered seeking professional help during this time?
text:nope. i feel that i get enough support from family. it might've been an option if I didn't have a strong support system. The seeker  feels that she does not have a strong support system. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek help from a professional.	labels:That's fantastic. Having family around during a tough season like this must be such a blessing. It's great that you can be there for your friend, almost as if they were part of your family, too.
text:yeah they feel like part of the family. i've known them since i was in college 20 years ago. we haven't always talked the whole time but.... The seeker  feels like family because she knows that her friend is going in for surgery. The supporter should also tell the seeker that they will support her friend in her time of need.	labels:20 years is a long time! It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!
text:thank ya. him and I are there for each other. We dated briefly at first but have been friends ever since. He said I was the one who got away. But he was the one who ended it lol. The seeker  is talking about his friend who is going in for heart surgery. The supporter is encouraging the seeker to be there for his friend. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker spend time with her friend.	labels:It sounds like you and him have had quite the history, but your friendship has proven to remain strong through thick and thin (20 years!). I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be for him to be waiting for surgery, and I'm sure it means the world to him that you are by his side. How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?
text:It's been good. We've been talking about Covid and the election too. I know I'd be nervous to go in for heart surgery. The seeker  said that she was worried about surgery. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is looking forward to the procedure.	labels:That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other?
text:just being there for each other as a listening ear. The seeker  feels nervous about going in for surgery because he fears that he won't be there. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is telling the truth, and that she can be there for her friend in these tough times.	labels:It's so easy to feel alone these days. Sometimes being present is all you can do, but it's the absolute best thing that you can do. Keep going, you're doing great!
text:thank ya! nity nite. The seeker  feels alone and nervous about the possibility of having to go in for surgery. The supporter should tell the seeker that she knows her friend is going through a hard time and that she is there for her and her friend.	labels:You're welcome! Thank you for being a wonderful friend, the world needs more people like you. Take care of yourself :)	episode_done:True
text:Hi. I am looking for support for depression.  My fiance died four years ago today and I am very sad. The seeker  is sad because she is going through such a horrible experience. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should go to a counseling place or a therapist for help.	labels:I am sorry to hear about your loss. How do you feel throughout the day?
text:Very sad.  I think about him often. The seeker  feels sad because it is sad that he died. Does the supporter know how he feels?	labels:It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.
text:Yes but how much time? The seeker  feels sad because of the loss of her fiance. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get counseling.	labels:Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.
text:I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him. The seeker  feels sad because there are no any words of support from the supporter. The supporter should ask the seeker to ask her friends and family to find ways to help her through her experience.	labels:I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.
text:Yes, I do try.  Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward? The seeker  feels depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences.	labels:I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?
text:Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle. The seeker  feels happy with the memories of her fiance, but worried about getting negative thoughts about her fiance. The supporter could tell her to tell people that they should not judge people.	labels:That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?
text:actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you. i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well. The seeker  is happy with memories of her fiance. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone and that people will be there for her. The supporter could also suggest some people to talk to and tell her that her fiance was a great person.	labels:Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.
text:i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself. I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals. The seeker  feels nervous about cooking class because it is a new hobby. The supporter could suggest the seeker to come up with a new hobby. The supporter could also tell the seeker to focus on learning how to cook.	labels:I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?
text:hmmm.  i love tacos.  and stews.  cheesecake. i used to bake ... but i'm diabetic so that's probably not such a good idea any more.  and since we're working at home now i can't bake and take it into the office for people to enjoy. The seeker  is happy to have food to eat with her partner. The supporter could ask the seeker to find an alternative occupation for the couple.	labels:Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.
text:oh my yes, the Cheesecake Factory has amazing cheesecake. I am going to go now. Thank you very much for your support. It helps to have an "ear" ... just to be able to talk about it and be reminded that it's all going to be okay.  Plus, that there's cheesecake in the world, so it can't all be bad, right? The seeker  feels better after talking to the supporter. The supporter should give the seeker some advice on how to cope with stress.	labels:Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you today?\nIm okay. How do you want to do this? The seeker  feels good about being relaxed. The supporter could also ask the seeker to do a meditation and to calm down by getting some relaxation exercises in the background.	labels:Sure! Can you please tell me how can i help you today?
text:Ive been feeling like other people dont like me. The seeker  feels like no one likes her. The supporter should not tell the seeker to just say that. The supporter should instead tell the seeker how she can help her.	labels:If I understand you correctly, do you assume people dislike you even if you can't tell for sure?
text:Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary. The seeker  was confused by the support, but the ally should try to make the listener feel confident in their opinion.	labels:It seems you are a bit low on self-confidence. I have been there too. If I may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?
text:Yeah, I've been texting my friend and he doesn't reply to me for hours and it makes me feel like he isnt as enthusiastic about our friendship as i am which hurts. The seeker  is feeling low on self-confidence. The supporter could try to set her up on a call with a psychologist, to tell the seeker what the cause of this feeling is.	labels:Right, the feeling of being ignored can be quite overwhelming. Have you tried speaking with your friend over phone or video call, assuming you have access to the technology?
text:We have decent phone conversations, I guess I'm just frustrated and sad about my worthiness, now that im typing it out it sounds not nearly as bad. Thank you.

The supporter could also suggest to the seeker to talk to her boss.	labels:So, even if they don't respond, just think they are driving or working, and try to avoid thinking that you are being ignored.
text:I always assume since im not busy that they arent too. I guessits a little self involved. The seeker  feels that she is not important and she assumes that it's because she is not busy. The supporter could say that you should do the same thing.	labels:Yes, sometimes assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. Always talk it out when you get a chance.

This pandemic is making everyone feel lonely I think. The seeker  feels lonely when she can't have her friends. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends.	labels:How about doing video call with your friends at home?
text:I hadn't thought about that!  They are all at different schools, but maybe I can do a Zoom meeting for all of us.

The supporter could tell the seeker that, but not to worry. The supporter could suggest the seeker to read about how to make friends for more information. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to join a club.	labels:if that's the case, you can use this chance to be there for her. I think talking to your mom will help you both.
text:Yes, I'll probably call her and my dad tonight. I'll let them know I'm a bit sad and lonely, but not so much that they worry. And then I'll start planning my virtual party with my friends!

text:Not too good. I am owed a lot of money by my friends but they aren't paying me back blaming covid. The seeker  felt bad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to call her friends and ask them to pay the debt.	labels:I can understand how stressful this could be for you! I would feel taken advantage of too. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. sorry I am not sure why it typed twice. Have your friends ever borrowed money before?
text:Yes, as recently as yesterday, but they keep delaying. And as though rubbing salt to wound, I can see them spending on personal goods instead of returning the money to me.

The supporter could also tell the seeker to be careful in talking to friends.	labels:I just meant if they had borrowed in past and returned it than maybe they were telling the truth but since you saw them blowing money that s rightfully yours is a problem.

The seeker  feels stressed but has not gotten any help from family. The supporter could suggest to the seeker that they have family to help them with financial issues.	labels:I understand and have been in your shoes and its NO FUN and they don't get to borrow ever again. . Have you explained just how much of an issue it is to them and flat out tell them you saw them spending money on junk etc when they could have given to you . Something is better than nothing . Maybe work out a plan of 50 a week if they work?
text:May be I can try that, $50 a week or asking them to pay in instalments sounds like a good idea. Problem is I loaned hard cash and I need as cash, not digital transfers. The seeker  feels stressed because the supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find therapy.	labels:And depending on how much of a  friend they are you need to see if this is worth losing friendship over. I mean if you are great friends I d lay low and never let them borrow again. IF you only knew them a short while and felt sorry for them and lent them money than I D talk to parents or someone.
text:I don't want to lose my friends, because they are the only people that helped me when I shifted to this city. But I don't like them taking undue advantage of me either.

Now its becoming an issue and I can't pay my bills.  I wanted to help you now can you please give me cash of xxx for xxx starting next friday.. Yes friends are hard to come by and you certainly don't need anyone to ever take advantage of you.   But the other side is do you want this person to be your friend if you can't trust them and they are showing you no disrespect or attempt to pay you back?
text:It's a good plan. Due to lockdown restrictions, I am unable to travel places. May be if I show up at their doors, they'll pay me back. I am gonna see if talking to them and asking for small payments works first. The seeker  feels like the support is not fair to him when he is not able to travel. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try to find someone who can help pay for the expenses.	labels:Awesome!  Good luck! If that doesn't work we can chat again and try something else. Keep safe and Keep the faith .  Personally I would recommend praying if you believe as I do!!!
text:Yes, I do pray and it has worked in the past. Let me try to stay calm and follow your ideas. Thanks! The seeker  feels relieved to be able to stay calm and follow a plan. The supporter could encourage the seeker to think about her friends for a second.	labels:Ok . Good luck.	episode_done:True

The supporter should also ask the seeker about her feelings about the hurtful things people have said to her.	labels:I said: that is really hard. Do you feel comfortable telling these people how their words hurt you?
text:I can't unfortunately. No one involved in the case may speak to each other. The seeker  feels uncomfortable to speak to the supporter. The supporter should suggest the seeker to make a call or email to the person who did hurt them.

text:Yes, it has been difficult and I feel very alone. Thank you for listening. The seeker  feels stressed because the supporter knows she did not receive the last message.

text:Mostly because of how he treats me lately. He makes disrespectful comments.... Are you female or male. The seeker  feels angry about how her husband treats her. It should be a good thing to be angry about how your husband treats you.	labels:So from what I understand, you think your anger is because of your husband's fault. Have you talked to him about his behavior? I am female.
text:No it wouldn't do any good I am afraid. Whenever I try to stand up for myself he says Oh here we go again Poor you etc. Like just tonight I mopped floor and he came up and said What are you sick ?  Youre actually cleaning. Than I said yes I was actually on my hands and knees last week when I mopped and he. said well get used to being on your knees. and touched himself. The seeker  struggles with anger because of the sexist behavior and the abuser.

The supporter could advise the seeker to talk to her husband. The supporter could also suggest that she or her husband could contact a therapist.	labels:You need to stand up for yourself. I know it's difficult and as you said, won't even do any good. However, if you keep your silence, he'd think it's okay to treat you that way because he has power over you.
text:I know even my good friends that know me and everything that is said agrees with you. The seeker  feels a little insecure about her power to stand up for herself. The supporter could suggest that the seeker call a therapist.	labels:I'd advise you to disclose this to a family member and have them with you (on the phone) when he starts talking like that. that way the other person can call him off.
text:My mom already knows and his parents are dead and he has no relations with any other family. . HE wont listen He knows everything and its HIs way or else. He is very controlling. The seeker  felt that she need to get help because she is afraid of her husband. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a psychologist, because the supporter feels that this is a real issue.	labels:if you want, you can talk to him one last time and let him know it's enough. I fhe doesn't change, you will cut off with him. You have to stand up for you self first before expecting him to do that.
text:Thats true and its time for a change. Thank you so much . I do feel better. The seeker  feels better, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should also bring up the other people in the house to make them aware of the issues.	labels:If he intimidates you, you should practice what to say and then do the talk in public or when someone else is around. I believe you can do it.
text:Thank you . Its sounds like you know what you are talking about. Ill try it. The seeker  says that she has been having anger issues and thinks she should tell a family member.

text:and he would prove I am an unfit mom. The seeker  feels threatened by the man. The supporter could advise the seeker to avoid him. If the seeker can't, then the supporter could suggest the seeker to give the man a chance.	labels:The mom always has an upper hand in these issues.

text:No not really. I havent had a lot of time recently because of my studies :( I message them once in awhile om facebook but we havent chatted much. The seeker  feels sad about not hanging out with friends. The supporter could offer the seeker to get more friends or try to make time without friends.	labels:Messaging on Facebook isn't quite as fun as hanging out in person.  I use Zoom to meetup with family and friends.  I had never heard of it until this pandemic hit.
text:Yeah i havent heard of it either before covid. I use it sometimes for class but never for chatting with friends. I just wish we could hang out again you know? The seeker  feels stressed about not being able to hang out with friends. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should make some time to be friends with other people in her life.	labels:I most certainly do know!  I just think to myself daily that this vaccine is going to get things back to normal.  Hang on, we're almost there.  In the meantime I suggest Zoom.  It really does make things somewhat less isolating.
text:Thank goodness the vaccine is being developed. The seeker  is happy to have the support. The supporter could tell the seeker they are having a good time with their friends.	labels:We're almost there!

The supporter could give the seeker a good reason to use Zoom.	labels:I would try it.  Also Meetup is doing virtual meetings. . You're welcome!  We have to look out for one another!

You do the same.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, how are you today?\nokay right now. The seeker  feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?
text:i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad.

The supporter could also ask the seeker what she is doing to make new friends.	labels:That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out..
text:i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good. The seeker  lost interest in the support, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could tell the seeker to state her problem in a different way.	labels:That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.
text:she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done.  she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality.  her background is similiar to mine,  i cannot abandon her as her other family has done. The seeker  feels like she is not being supported and does not know what to say. The supporter can suggest that the seeker do a first step in reaching out to her cousin and speak with her.	labels:That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?
text:on antidepressant meds, COVID makes it hard to keep in touch with provider, your comparison about the oxygen mask is a good one. . The seeker  feels that she has been treated unfairly. The supporter could explain that the seeker has been struggling with depression and the COVID treatment had no help for her.	labels:I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.
text:a possible path to look into. thanks. The seeker  is interested in finding a support group. The supporter can give the seeker some ideas about how to contact group.

text:not right now but thanks for your concern. The seeker  is excited to have the support and new ideas to help her. The supporter could use reminders and reminders could talk to the seeker.	labels:Alright. You're welcome, it's what I'm here for. I hope you have a good rest of your day!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker  did hello. The supporter should also do hello.	labels:Hello :)
text:This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as others? The seeker  was nervous because she is new to the work environment and the support was reassuring. The supporter could try to reassure her.	labels:So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?
text:that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? The seeker  feels overwhelmed by the work and feels like she doesn't measure up to anyone around her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she and her co-workers are more experienced and successful than she is.	labels:I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job. I am sure that with time you will get the same results as them if not better! Are there any co-workers you feel close to or see a friendship developing with?
text:that's nice of you to say but I also don't feel as organised. I suppose that's to be understood in a new job scenario.. Yes there are a few really nice co-workers. The seeker  feels organised, but doesn't feel close to a friend. The supporter could explain that she is working on getting organised.	labels:Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started..
text:I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to? The seeker  is confused about if she is doing too much to get her co-workers. The supporter could also ask for advice on whether she should be doing too much or too little.	labels:That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
text:I suppose it's difficult to know when something is too much for you or if you need to give it more time.. The seeker  feels overwhelmed and stressed by work situation. The supporter could say that she was stressed by the work situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to start the school of life and get that feeling back.	labels:I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.
text:Thankshe problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks. The seeker  shows signs of anxiety and stress. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the co-workers are very supportive and that they are there for her.	labels:I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
text:Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself? The seeker  feels that she is too stressed because she thought it would be a good idea to go to a study group. The supporter could say to the seeker that take a break and take a break.	labels:Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all..
text:Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me. The seeker  feels overwhelmed, but it is too early to talk about a job. The supporter could suggest a co-worker, or have a friend or family member who knows someone who works in a similar position.	labels:Of course you are not alone!
text:I think I'll give this a good few weeks and ask myself how I think I'm doing then go from there. Thanks for the chat and your suggestions. The seeker  feels pressured and anxious about the academic situation because of the tense situation. The supporter could suggest them to talk to friends and family.

Remember no matter what you will find somewhere you belong!	episode_done:True
text:Hi. The seeker  does not recognize a friend. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should not be alone with the sponsor. The seeker could also say something to the support to be more upbeat.	labels:hello, how are you?
text:Honestly I'm not doing too great. hbu. The seeker  feels stressed and not confident. The supporter should focus on the seeker's strengths. The supporter could also remind the seeker about the support she has.	labels:I'm doing ok, Is there anything you would like to chat about?
text:Yeah my long time partner cheated on me recently and I just found out. I havent been able to see them in awhile because of lock down and now they tell me this :( The seeker  is not sure if she should tell her partner about her feelings. The supporter could help by asking her partner to leave the relationship. The supporter could also tell the seeker to be honest with her partner.	labels:That is horrible I am so sorry they done that to you.
text:thanks. its just been such a hard couple of months because of the virus. And now with this I just dont know what to do. The seeker  does not feel happy because she does not know if her partner cheated on her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk about it with friends. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to her partner because of the illness and how she feels.	labels:I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is.
text:Yeah its an awful feeling and I just feel really sad. The seeker  feels sad about being cheated on. The supporter could suggest asking her friend for a hug or a food reward. The supporter could also encourage her to talk about it to an important person in her life.	labels:I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out.
text:I haven't spoken to anyone yet I dont want to bother anyone. The seeker  is fearful about the boyfriend because of the rumors about the cheating. The supporter should also tell the seeker to talk to friends and talk to other people. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and talk to others. The supporter could also tell the seeker that her boyfriend is going to be very upset in the next couple of days.	labels:don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.
text:Yeah I guess I should talk to someone about it. what else do you think I should do? The seeker  feels sad because the supporter wanted to talk about the situation. The supporter might encourage the seeker to talk to family and friends. The seeker might also say that she is happy about the situation.	labels:When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.
text:Yeah maybe I should try that. What else do you think would help? The seeker  feels the need to talk to someone about the cheating. The supporter could say the seeker to be honest with the situation. The supporter could also talk to the seeker to offer her support.	labels:letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again.
text:Yeah I definitely will not be going back to them. They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again. The seeker  feels alone and worried about going back to the cheating ex. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and find therapy.	labels:exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them.
text:yeah. thanks for sharing your experience with me. I feel a little better now :) The seeker  is happy with the new information, but the seeker feels confident about the new information.	labels:you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you. you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you.

The supporter could also suggest a new partner to help her deal with the feelings of being cheated on by a partner.	labels:Anytime, I hope you have a great day as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker  does good guy. The supporter could ask the seeker to have a good time with the seeker.	labels:Hello.  How's it going?
text:I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions. The seeker  feels stressed because she is conflicted and conflicted because she feels she is unable to stay positive. The supporter could recommend the seeker to find a different way to be positive.	labels:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?
text:I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now. The seeker  feels stressed and fearful about the North of the country. The supporter could help the seeker to talk about how to feel better. The supporter could also talk about what the south of the country is like.	labels:I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary! .
text:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation. The seeker  feels low motivation because of her friends. The supporter should suggest that the seeker talk to a friend. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker call a psychologist.	labels:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
text:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? The seeker  feels lonely and not sure of friends. The supporter could help the seeker find friends online or to meet friends by using various platforms such as Skype.	labels:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.
text:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself? The seeker  feels depressed because of the depression in the past. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try to get out of situations and be in a positive place. The supporter could also have advice for the seeker to be successful and get out of depression.	labels:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.
text:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this? The seeker  feels depressed and has a bad feeling about the future. The supporter could encourage the seeker to try to find friends to hang out with. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to make friends with someone who can help her deal with her depression.	labels:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
text:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also? The seeker  is against depression. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends or to a therapist.	labels:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?
text:I've never heard of this, what is it? The seeker  feels depressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
text:I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free? The seeker  feels depressed because of the current situation. The supporter could offer to help the seeker set up a virtual book club.	labels:Totally free!
text:I like the sound of that, thanks for your help. The seeker  has feelings about depression and the support is helpful. The supporter could also tell the seeker that there are many ways to help. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get help from some professionals.	labels:You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.
text:thank you for the vote of confidence. The seeker  is feeling positive about her job situation and positive about her friends. The supporter could tell her that. The supporter could also tell her to keep up with a book club.	labels:Very welcome!	episode_done:True
text:hello how are you today?\nHi there. I'm OK but have had a difficult time at work recently. The seeker  was enthusiastic about her new job. The supporter could suggest that the seeker try to set up a study group with other students and have them communicate with one another to get motivation.	labels:i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?
text:Yes I have been given what I can only describe as ridiculous feedback by my manager and it had annoyed me greatly. I'm thinking about complaining about it. The seeker  feels that her manager has been unreasonable to her. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?
text:I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something? The seeker  feels stressed about being yelled at for not smiling, but the reasons for that are not given. The supporter could say that the seeker is worried about hurting her relationship with her manager. The supporter could also say that the seeker is worried about the negative feedback that she is receiving.	labels:Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.
text:I'm thinking perhaps I should go to a different manager and voice these concerns. I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me. The seeker  feels frustrated because of the feedback. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to a different manager and suggest the seeker to become more aware of what the feed back is.	labels:Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.
text:yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future. The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me. The seeker  feels unhappy, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to look for professional therapy.	labels:Yes i can see where that would be a problem.
text:perhaps I'm just making too much of a big deal about this. how would you react if someone gave you similar feedback in work? The seeker  feels like she is being given a set back because she has not gotten a job, but she is not sure if she will be able to get a job next year.	labels:Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?
text:I haven't actually thought about that as a solution but that might work actually. I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally. The seeker  feels over thinking; she feels like she is being a little bit selfish. The supporter could tell the seeker that this is a common thought that people have and have to work on. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to her supervisor and ask her to work on this.	labels:Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.
text:I think that's an interesting perspective. she might have issues herself and be taking them out on members of her team in work which is quite sad really. Do you think I should just be blunt and ask her the question? The seeker  is worried about her manager and her team. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is ok to be happy.	labels:I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.
text:so be supportive but also make it clear that what she has said has had an impact on me? The seeker  has been hurtful and has been taken out of work. It seems that the seeker is worried about being taken out of work. The supporter could tell the seeker she will get the best of the job and it will make the seeker feel better. The supporter could also tell the seeker it is OK to be upset.	labels:Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
text:ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice. The seeker  feels that the colleague is hurting her. The supporter should try to help her by talking to her manager or finding a group of people to talk with.	labels:In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.	episode_done:True
text:Hello :) The seeker  did hello. The supporter should also do hello.	labels:Hello how are you doing today?
text:I'm doing well how bout yourself? The seeker  feels good about her day. The supporter could let her know that she is doing well.	labels:I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?
text:I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. I havent been doing as well since covid. and I'm kind of upset at my self for it. The seeker  feels down because the supporter should tell the seeker to set up reminders. The supporter could also tell the seeker to set up a study group.	labels:Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.
text:Yeah the online schooling is tough for me. I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school. I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( The seeker  feels motivated because of the online schooling, but the supporter knows that there are many problems. The supporter should tell the seeker that she needs to deal with the issues of the school.	labels:I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)
text:the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it. sure thing :) share. The seeker  feels sad about being unable to see her friends. The supporter could give her a list of things that she does like about her life and share it with her. The supporter could also say something about the reasons for her sadness.	labels:Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.
text:You bring up a good point about changing environment. I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight. Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :) I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them. The seeker  is depressed that she has no time to do the activities she enjoys. The supporter could suggest that maybe she could try to get some time to do them.	labels:Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :) You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around.
text:Yeah maybe I should do that. The seeker  feels motivated to change her routine because she can't sit down for a break. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take a break every few hours because it is hard to do that every day.	labels:And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!
text:gotta switch things up. Yeah I should chat with my friends more too. Its hard to fine time but I should try. The seeker  tries to change the routine. The supporter could encourage the seeker to try something new. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to be more busy and try new things.	labels:It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)
text:very very true especially in these difficult times. Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap. and everythiung can go back to normal. The seeker  did the mental health thing. The supporter could offer her support, like she is not happy with the situation. The supporter could also talk about different things she does to help her anyway.	labels:Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then.

text:I'm doing alright I suppose, just trying to do a few mturk tasks to feel like I'm accomplishing something. Waiting to hear back from unemployment and not hearing back from any job applications makes it hard to ever really relax. The seeker  feels anxious about going to unemployment. The supporter could tell the seeker to get a job as soon as possible.	labels:Ah, i hear you. The lack of response makes it really easy for me to make up stories in my head and fear the worst.
text:I've never done any computer based jobs before, I did live audio and carpentry before this, so I just feel like I don't qualify for anything, but I'm immune compromised so until this is over i don't know what other work I can safely do besides for something from my computer.... I just feel so terribly stuck. The seeker  feels stuck, but is not confident enough to get out of her computer. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are more opportunities out there.	labels:I'm sorry. I know the feeling of not knowing where I fit in. Its a whole world shift, too.
text:I haven't received any financial assistance from the government yet, I've been living off of loans from friends and what little of my art I've been able to sell. It's stressful. I just want my life back. I felt like I was on a really good career path at the first of the year, and now I just don't even know what o do. The seeker  feels like she is on a terrible career path because it is stressful. The supporter should encourage the seeker to be optimistic and take steps.	labels:That scattered feeling....trying to put the pieces back together....I've walked the same road this year. Would you be willing to mourn for what you had before? To let it go?
text:I don't want to. If there is a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 then the company I worked for before this will be able to go back to business, and I've been assured my old job back. I'm just in limbo right now, figuring out how to survive until then and keep from going crazy. The seeker  feels guilty because she has not been able to manage her life before. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can continue to do this, but do it in different ways.	labels:you have determination! There is fire within! Tell me, what brings you joy?

Thank you for chatting with me, and helping me earn the maximum bonus for this task! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day! Good luck in your own endeavors.. The seeker  feels happy by chatting with the supporter. The supporter could also tell the seeker to share some of her own story.	labels:but of course! it was a pleasure to connect. keep chasing joy daily!
text:oh, I think you need a couple more inputs on your end to finish. The seeker  is asking for input from the supporter. The supporter could ask the seeker some questions about what the seeker would like to do for the supporter. The supporter could also ask the seeker a few questions about the types of projects that the supporter would like to help the seeker get started on.	labels:oh good, well i got inputs to put!
text:Perhaps you could tell me what brings you joy? The seeker  is happy with her life so she asks for a couple of inputs to help her. The supporter could tell the seeker to ask for more input if she feels unfulfilled.	labels:YES! for one, this mturk task is AMAZING  to me. Connection has been a huge boon for me this year. I thrive on helping others realize their strengths.
text:I'm glad you're enjoying it, I like this task too. The seeker  feels motivated by the mturk task. The supporter could tell the seeker to make less effort, and enjoy the mturk task.	labels:between that and creation, i love to express myself. art, movement, building something.....its all just me expressing myself, getting my head into the world.
text:That is beautiful! Keep it up! The seeker  feels joy because of mturk task. The supporter could tell the seeker to keep doing it.	labels:whenever i can :)	episode_done:True

The supporter could tell the seeker to make friends and encourage her to do the same.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. breakups are definitely hard to go through, especially in the times we are in right now. How long were you guys together? And you were living together?
text:We were together for almost 5 years and we were living together he had all the money in his name and I have nothing now. The seeker  feels that he or she was taken advantage by his or her boyfriend. The supporter should start by asking if the seeker is the one in trouble. The supporter should also start by asking if the seeker is in trouble with the boyfriend.	labels:Oh I see that was a very long relationship! I actually just got out of a 3 1/2 year one myself, so I understand how hard it is. Are you still currently staying with him until you find your own place? Or are you staying somewhere else?
text:I am currently trying to find a way to get to my mom who lives about 150 miles away. Im staying with my friend for now but she said I can only stay for 2 more days. Yeah break ups are the worst. The seeker  is worried about her boyfriend leaving. The supporter could suggest to ask her friend to stay with her until she can get a job. The supporter could also encourage her to come to the support group to share more information.	labels:I'm glad to hear that you are with a friend right now during this hard time, and that you have a place to go! But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there.
text:Yeah she is a good friend im happy that I can stay with her for the time being its just stressful trying to get to my mom. The seeker  feels stressed and worried about staying with boyfriend. The supporter should mention that the seeker is struggling with finding a place to stay. The supporter could say the seeker has to find a place to stay for now.	labels:If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time.
text:Yeah I definitely agree. I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though. It does make me feel better to talk about it though and lay it all out it makes it easier to figure my stuff out. The seeker  was cheered up after the conversation. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she can borrow some money from friends and family. The supporter could also tell the seeker to ask for a loan from friends or family.	labels:That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this. It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful.
text:Yeah thanks I appreciate that. I feel a lot better I hope you have an awesome day! I do understand what I need to do for sure. It was just overwhelming thinking about everything and talking it and listing it out makes me feel better for sure. The seeker  feels better after talking about everything. The supporter could give the seeker some advice on how to handle the breakup. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she cares about her friend.	labels:Yeah that's great. I have confidence that you will get over this bump in your life, and good things will come to you. Keep focusing on what you need to do! You are doing great!.	episode_done:True

The seeker  is anxious about job future because she is a licensed nurse. The supporter could say that the seeker is scared to go back to work, but the supporter should tell the seeker that her fears are unfounded and that there are people around her to help her.	labels:That must be hard. COVID has really turned our world upside down! What type of occupation are you in?
text:I'm studying to be a pharmacist. Really scared of getting sick too since I have to work in hosptials and such. The seeker  feels anxious about getting sick because of the covid.	labels:That's great! It is because of front-line workers and people like you that we are at least able to put a fight against the pandemic! My hat tip to you for choosing your line of profession. Major pharma companies have already announced vaccines and they have a success rate of more than 90 -95%. So my friend, this too shall pass..
text:Yeah  I've been reading those research articles recently they look promising. I'm hoping the vaccines get developed early next year and everything can go back to normal. The seeker  is feeling stressed and worried about her job. The supporter should ask the seeker her opinion on the vaccines. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to her friends and find a solution.	labels:I feel the same way too! Modern technology is indistinguishable from magic!. So hang in there, with the US election results and the vaccine announcement, things will surely get better..
text:Yeah it's looking like things will improve. The seeker  is excited about the vaccines. The supporter should suggest that the seeker try to get some motivation for her career.	labels:If you are in North America, the pandemic rate will go high due to combination with flu season, but at the end of the day, we will develop herd immunity.
text:Yeah not looking forward to flu season. I wish people would just stop throwing parties and getting everyone sick. The seeker  feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should be able to get a good job. The supporter could also suggest to the seeker to search for other work to do and create a better job. The supporter could also point out that there are jobs that are open in the area. The seeker could also look into her options.	labels:Well, nobody is, my friend! But it's part of life. And ya, morons will exist all over the world. Since you are young, even if you contract, you will recover pretty easily. But, God forbid, if you do, please practice social distancing and stay home!
text::( yeah they do don't they. Yeah i'll definitely keep my self isolated if im sick. im worried about all my  friends too because all of us will be out working in hospitals soon.

text:Hey, how are you doing?\nNot the best, but I'm surviving. hello? The seeker  is not the best, but the supporter could give a compliment about the seeker. The supporter could also tell the seeker to be thankful for the seeker's efforts to live a happy life. The supporter could also give the seeker a hug.	labels:By surviving, it is more of a personal situation or an outside dilemma affecting you. is it*
text:I just haven't been able to find any work. I guess that is an outside dilemma, but being this behind on bills and feeling this helpless to change my situation has negatively impacted my mood. The seeker  felt helpless, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask how to change her situation. She should also ask how often the seeker should be able to change.	labels:I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.
text:I have already been budgeting extensively, the issue is I can't make enough to cover my basic expenses, no matter how much I cut them. The seeker  feels stressed because of her lack of money. The supporter could tell the seeker to start saving more and make it more clear that her situation is not a personal issue.	labels:Are you also pressed for time? Time management can be a predicament as well.
text:I have lots of free time, just waiting for unemployment to respond to my claims, applying for jobs online, and trying services like mturk to earn what I can from home in the meantime.. I spend a good portion of my day trying to apply for everything I can and fixating on mturk tasks to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something. The seeker  explains what she needs from her job and how she can get it done. The supporter could tell the seeker to apply for jobs online and apply to mturk.	labels:Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. For someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes. I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.
text:I get to a point in my day where it feels like I've done everything I can for that day, and then I just have to try not to get too stir crazy. The seeker  feels stressed about her day. The supporter could tell the seeker to take care of her own health. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should talk to friends or family to make sure she is not stressed.	labels:I feel that if you can focus on using your extra time as an investment into yourself (whether by reading, picking up a hobby, or working out), you can feel more accomplished and at ease with what you are doing in life.
text:I've been trying to look ahead, but this year has already set me back so much from my intended career path that it's frustrating. I just want my life back. That is good advice. I have been doing a lot more art during this time. The seeker  feels stressed about her life situation, but does not know how to overcome it. The supporter could suggest the seeker to calculate how many hours she will spend in the future, if she was successful in her career path.	labels:Being progressive is difficult, but is one of the things in life which compound very easily. I believe many aspects in life are connected and that improving in some parts improves you as a whole.
text:Some days it's tempting to just do nothing and wait for it all to be over, but I feel better when I accomplish something for the day. The seeker  feels better when she accomplished something. The supporter could encourage the seeker to stop procrastinating and to think about what she is doing to improve. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she has a lot of toil ahead in life and that she will have a lot of obstacles to overcome in the near future.	labels:And if these "improvements" can also make you money/increase your worth/ease your mind, then that can be called a success. In my opinion atleast..
text:I wish someone was interested in buying my art! That would be a huge confidence boost. The seeker  feels confident because they have a plan, they have money, they have a job and they are excited about their future. The supporter should also encourage the seeker that it can be done.	labels:Yeah, but imagine how it would if you had days like that knowing it isn't a bad thing to relax. You have already put in the work in being comfortable before, allowing to enjoy your time however way you wanted. Looks like you already have an interest which can help you in many ways in life. That's really good.
text:yes, I miss being able to actually relax. When you are financially behind it feels like everything is just making it worse. thank you for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task! The seeker  feels lucky to feel good about the job at hand. The supporter could cue the seeker to make sure she is happy in life. The supporter could also tell the seeker to make sure she is happy with the job they offer.	labels:Yes, the tension and pressure only seems to mount on, but there will always be things like that in life. It is important to remember whether such problems are in your control or not. If they are, you know for sure that you can change how you are presently. No problem, this is a very interesting experience for me too.	episode_done:True

text:But my family is away from me in another country. I can't even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying. The seeker  feels betrayed by her girlfriend because she is alone. The supporter could encourage her to go back to her family and try to meet them. The supporter could tell her that she is a good person and try to get her help.	labels:yeah I could understand your feelings right now.
text:I actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. I feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but I can't do anything . I am helpless. The seeker  feels useless, abandoned, and betrayed. She is discouraged and depressed by the friend's actions. The supporter should try to give the seeker an emotional connection to the friend, but could try to keep the request simple.	labels: yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to.
text:Why are girls like this? The seeker  feels like she is in a state of mind where she can't do anything. She is helpless. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to talk to friends or someone in the community.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker do some activities with her family to try to help.	labels:Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.
text:Yes, but I still seem to struggle with feeling a bit more down than I'd like. Not sure what to do. The seeker  feels down because she feels stressed out. The supporter should help the seeker remember to do activities, share stories and think about ways to help.	labels:Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.
text:I have tried meditation before, but quite a bit back. Do you have any activities you could recommend, without risking my health? Maybe in my own home, so that I can social distance. The seeker  feels anxious about her health, but she is not sure what to do. She should ask the supporter how to help her.	labels:One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.
text:Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out. The seeker  feels relaxed and calm. The supporter could try to get the seeker to take a deep breath and to exhale slowly through her nose.	labels:Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same. It is harder nowadays with covid but there are many online groups. You could even start your own group!
text:Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too. Maybe I should block the ones that have mostly negative posts? The seeker  is worried about feeling more depressed because she listens to negative posts on social media. She might need to block the ones that have a tone of negativity.	labels:I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control.
text:I wished I had some more ideas on some fun, interesting or things to fill my time at home. I often feel I get in a bit of a rut with the same thing. Since we are home more now. The seeker  feels the same as the supporter. The seeker is stressed and worried about her job situation. The supporter could advise the seeker to social media to get news related.	labels:Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?
text:Well, I used to read quite a bit more, but I have slowed down on it. Maybe I should go and grab a few books. Thanks for the idea! The seeker  has a book and is reading it. The supporter could help the seeker to read books, take walks or get a lot of activities that I would recommend.	labels:You are quite welcome. I too find reading to be a most welcome escape.

text:Hi good afternoon, I am seeking support for my anxiety related to my job. Is this something you can help me with? The seeker  feels anxiety about her job and the supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Hey there, please do share! I would love to help! Why is your job causing you to have anxiety?
text:Wonderful! My job is causing me some stress and anxiety. Everything is usually good except for my one coworker who tries to boss me around. She is very unhelpful and hypocritical. You cannot even talk to her without her interrupting or being rude. I am trying to find a better way to deal with the situation. The seeker  is happy because she is seeking support. The supporter should encourage her to seek professional help.	labels:I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?
text:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens. I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult. The seeker  feels more nervous than she did in the previous conversation. The supporter could help the seeker to talk to the coworker to find a way to set things right.	labels:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down. Since clearly this is affecting you at work and outside of it. Talking to HR should help.. What do you think?
text:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally. Our office is small so it would likely just be my boss who I have mentioned it to before. I think of it as she may not be working here that much longer. and is only part time now. The seeker  feels nervous about talking to HR because she knows that HR may not be helpful. The supporter could suggest that the seeker ask HR if they are not doing anything. In this conversation, the seeker feels nervous because of HR, but not because of her stress. The supporter could suggest that the seeker talk to a professional, who can give a different opinion.	labels:Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home. I also recommend finding ways to destress, listening to music, lightning candles or starting a series on netflix.
text:Thats true, it is good to put it in that perspective and to have another opinion on the subject. And think of another way to handle everything. The seeker  feels stressed, but there is a mediator coming who is trying to help. The supporter can ask if there is anything else she can do or suggest.	labels:Glad to help!
text:Thank you very much! The seeker  feels stressed and anxious about the work she is doing. The supporter can tell the seeker to get away from work and relax.

text:Thank you and same to you. I appreciate your support! What do you do to unwind after a stressful day. The seeker  is stressed, but the supporter can tell the seeker to relax because it is a stress reliever. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are things she can do to unwind after the stress. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to do some yoga or meditation.	labels:Personally, I spend time with family. Then I have a can of seltzer, watch something on netflix and unwind.
text:Netflix and seltzer have solved many of my problems. The seeker  has been relieved of stress caused by her work. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk to a therapist and to work on the issues with her work.	labels:Haha it's a winning combination. Maybe a salty snack or something sweet depending how stressful the day was.	episode_done:True

text:I should be graduating in June. The seeker  did fear getting into academic probation. The supporter could explain that the seeker has a much better chance if she does well on the exams. The supporter could also tell the seeker about a study group or join a study group to get more motivation.	labels:I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?
text:You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology. The seeker  feels stressed because of the university and its job prospects. The supporter could ask for more information about the school and its job prospects.	labels:Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?
text:Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \ The seeker  feels stress because she was unable to graduate. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should stop studying, think about what all the exams are, and seek professional help.	labels:Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.
text:That's great advice and likely would be my best option. I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it. The seeker  feels secure in the goal of graduating in June. The supporter could tell the seeker that dropping her minor is a scary idea, but that she is not alone.	labels:From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this.

text:Yes I am very stressed. I hate taking online courses and this pandemic is wearing me out. Plus I have a 2 year old son. The seeker  feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned, and the supporter should talk to her parents.	labels:You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!
text:Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive. The seeker  feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once! Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?	episode_done:True

The supporter could ask the seeker to try to come to meet family and tell what has happened to her.	labels:Do you have any support in the area you live in?
text:No, I do not really have any support in the area I live. The seeker  feels stressed and fearful of the divorce. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could start taking care of her finances.	labels:I'm glad you reached out.  Having support is something we all need.  Zoom and being far away isn't the ideal support I'm sure.
text:Yes, it's not ideal, but it is nice to have support even if it is over the phone, Zoom, etc.. The seeker  does not have any support. The supporter could suggest the seeker to consider meeting with a psychologist or a counselor.	labels:Most definitely.  I'm far away from my family too so Zoom and phone calls have been great despite the long distance.  Have you visited your family since Covid began?
text:I was able to visit them once over the Summer, which was great! The seeker  has reached out to her family and is able to have some kind of support. The supporter should say that to the seeker, she is very grateful and thankful for the support.	labels:That's awesome!  I'm planning on going to visit mine next Summer.  Are you able to see them before years end?  If not, maybe early next year? Hopefully Covid will be just a memory.
text:I probably won't be able to visit them this year. But, hopefully things will calm down and I can visit them early next year some time! The seeker  is happy to be reunited with her family.

text:hello!!\nI can't find a job since I've been staying home with the children so many years and am so ashamed I can't pay my bills now. The seeker  is ashamed about staying home, but the supporter can be encouraging. The supporter could encourage the seeker to try to find a job.	labels:Do you lost your job because of pandemic.
text:No, it's because I am a caregiver to my children for so many years and now people are like what experience do you have. The seeker  did lack confidence in her work because she is a caregiver. I suggest going to a personal finance site and looking up "temporary job-saving tools" because she has no idea what she is doing.	labels:yeah that's a bad situation it seems.
text:Yes, I don't know how to begin as it is stressful. The seeker  feels that she has lost her job because of the pandemic. The supporter could say the seeker is not a good caregiver. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to try to find other opportunities.	labels:there are many companies that recruit freshers have a try on it.
text:Where do I find them? The seeker  is saying that she is concerned about the situation. The supporter can ask the seeker to find out where she is.	labels:there are many online recruiting websites in internet you can register yourself with those websites and have a try over local industries.

text:That sounds like a possibility.  I hope it would work for me. The seeker  hopes the recruiter will work on the process. She would also like to have a chance to speak to a recruiter. She could also think of employers to apply to.	labels:otherwise if yo had an idea of starting a small business it is more better joining a job.
text:I would love to do that.  How do you start? The seeker  does not have any experience with recruitment process. He does not know how to start a small business. The supporter could tell the seeker that a recruiter is a good and efficient way to start a small business.	labels:there are many possibilities of starting a business. what we need is an innovative idea some amount for initial investment and many business can be started with minimum space like within home.
text:That sounds very interesting and promising. I could also care for the kids still if needed. The seeker  feels like she has lost the job so the seeker wants to start a business but the supporter could suggest doing something else.	labels:yeah that's good for you and also your children.

text:Good afternoon, what can I help you with today? .\nHi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then. Sometimes at night, (and only at night) I get in these super depressive moods and have almost mental breakdowns about everything in my life. But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why. The seeker  feels depressed, but there is not much information about why. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask her friends and family for help.	labels:That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. .
text:Yeah it is, and I'm not sure why it happens. The seeker  is going through a difficult time. The supporter should remind the seeker of the importance of therapy and the importance of the future. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker go to counseling because it can help the seeker to find a better focus on her present.	labels:Especially when the sun starts going down sooner, it can seem like we have less time, and as if things are closing in upon us. .
text:Yeah exactly. Where I live, we just had daylight savings so it gets dark around 5:30 PM and it feels like my days are just wasted. The seeker  feels stressed because of the sun. The supporter could suggest the seeker to call her parents and talk to them about what she is going through. The supporter could also suggest different activities and activities that the seeker can do to help her feel more comfortable in her own time.	labels:There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. . As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.
text:Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule. And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger. The seeker  feels anxious about being able to get up early to go to school. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get vitamin D and make sure not to miss anything.	labels:That's an understandable fear. . I challenge you to think about it as not too different from this chat here;  An opportunity to get some objective advice and perspective. .
text:Wow yeah I didn't even really think about that... And I'm sure there are ways to get in contact with therapists without having to be face to face? I just like the anonymous aspect of it. I feel like I come across as weak if people see me for me. The seeker  feels weak because it is difficult to get in contact with a therapist. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get professional help.	labels:Yes, BetterHelp is one of those I believe. TalkSpace is another one.
text:Yeah that's true I have heard of BetterHelp. Maybe I should reach out on one of those platforms when  I feel like I am going into one of my depressive episodes. The seeker  realizes that there is a therapist and they want to talk. The supporter could tell the seeker to contact a therapist.	labels:It may be helpful!  As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. . The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you "need" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing. .
text:Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it. I never thought how that would help me though. I will totally do it more often when I am slumping. The seeker  feels that she needs to go to bed, but wants to change the situation. The supporter could suggest that she spend some time in bed.	labels:You sound optimistic and like you're open to trying new things to help, I think you're going to start feeling better soon. .

You are very welcome!. I hope you have a wonderful evening :-)	episode_done:True

text:Yes, I am going to my mothers house to talk things over.. I have to drive 3 hours away. The seeker  did visit her mothers house, which is a good idea. The supporter could let the seeker know that she is not the only person who has been through the same situation, and that they will talk.	labels:Oh dear, that's a long time alone with your thoughts..

text:yes, i can always count on her to be there for me. my younger brother is always there for me too. The seeker  feels safe and secure. The supporter could tell the seeker to do a drive-through from mother's house.	labels:That's awesome.  Family support is crucial..

I will tell you that you can only take care of yourself.  And you can only be honest with them about how their actions affect you. .
text:He is a wonderful person when he isn't drinking, but is argumentative when they drink. I do, we have talked over and over about how this affects both of us. And he cares when he is sober, but it doesn't seem to be enough to keep him from going back. The seeker  feels like an alcoholic and has to explain the problem to a supporter.

The seeker  is stressed about public speaking because it is difficult, and the supporter should tell the seeker to change the topic to something more interesting.	labels:Yes, the physical nervousness that can manifest is powerful.

The supporter could also consider taking a cheerleader role.	labels:"That is a really great question that I've never considered! Maybe XYZ?  I can check on that and get back to you with a sure answer though!" . There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now. . Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions.

The seeker  feels that because he is married to a white trash person he is going to be treated with respect. There are no apologies for the abuse but the sponsor should note that the seeker has been abused by her husband and the seeker needs to be more aggressive about taking care of herself and trying to work through it.	labels:What a terrible thing to say.

It can be helpful to ask if Doug is available before hooking up.	labels:I'm sure it's frustrating that you're not getting the emotional support you need. It's great that you are reaching out to communicate with someone.
text:I heard of people falling for a fling or one night stand but this has gone on for months. Add to that, I see him at work. He's married and  I don't see this as more than a long term hook up.

The supporter should seek professional help and help her to seek out a way to get out of the relationship.	labels:I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that. I've known lots of people who've ended up in relationships with married people. Just reaching out to talk with someone else is a great first step.
text:What did those people do to end the relationship if you want to call it that? You keep saying it's good to reach out.

And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?
text:My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more.+ Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go? I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean? The seeker  feels that Doug is not his own man. When he talks to Doug, the supporter should make sure the seeker is not using Doug as her own man.	labels:I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife. You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need. Do you think he's being fully honest with you about his relationship with his wife?
text:I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem. The seeker  feels frustrated because Doug isn't providing support. The supporter should ask the seeker to find a therapist.	labels:You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem. He's cheating on his wife, and he's not giving you the emotional support you need.
text:All I want to know from you is to tell me how to get rid of the feelings I have for Doug or how to get rid of his wife since you think she's part of the problem?

The seeker  feels threatened and scared of Doug. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should seek professional help with gaining control over her emotions. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker could seek therapy.	labels:I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty..
text:Why do you keep focusing on the wife? You make it sound if I just kill her Doug and I could be happy and I wouldn't have to worry about his Philandering as you call it anymore. Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? The seeker  is concerned about the wife. The supporter could suggest that the seeker simply needs to ask the questions before seeking help.	labels:You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.
text:You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it? Are you still with the man/woman or whatever that broke your heart and cheated on you? Why cant you get over it? Is the only advice for me you have is to eat Thanksgiving dinner alone?

The supporter could offer hope and advice about what to do with the situation.	labels:I absolutely have had my heart broken, yes. And I've spent some holidays alone. I can understand your pain.
text:I'm glad you understand my pain. I've spent and know how to be by myself. What I'm asking you how do I get out being in love with someone? The seeker  has a problem with love. The supporter should ask the seeker to try to talk to her husband.	labels:It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not "the one." He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.
text:Okay so I eat Thanksgiving alone and I spend time alone. Okay tell me how i fill my nights alone up? How do I warm the other side of my bed which Doug fill so well. I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not! Also, I don't think being with Doug is settling! I do however appreciate your time and effort.. The seeker  feels lonely and stressed because she is alone.

text:I can try to keep myself busy and practice self care. It is hard though because I still worry. Sometimes I feel too worried to do the things necessary to stop it all spiraling. The seeker  noticed the support asking for help because she is worried about her job situation. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also remind the seeker about the importance of self care, such as exercise.	labels:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the "pause" of the pandemic. Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?
text:I have practiced breathing techniques and meditation before and think that is a great suggestion. At the moment I think the only thing that would ultimately really make me feel better is knowing my friend is okay. He already has health issues so it is a worry. The seeker  feels so busy, but she doesn't know what to do to stop the panic. The supporter should address the seeker's anxieties about the friend.	labels:Absolutely, and it's completely understandable, but it's very hard to wait. I hope that you are able to practice some of the techniques we talked about, and seeking help by talking about it is part of self-care, too. I think you are on the right track to getting through this..

The supporter could also tell the seeker to try to talk to her friends or family and get support.	labels:I worked for a boss who gave me a chance when I was rather unhirable.
