text:That is also true. Sometimes I wonder if it really is for me though. The seeker has desired what is best for the support. The supporter can tell the seeker that she needs to work on her own goals and needs to do it. The supporter can ask the seeker to share that desire.	labels:I've had to deal with collections before when I was in  bad financial condition. The person on the other line was really helpful though. She was understanding, It may not be for you. I think you should think about the pros and cons of keeping your position. It might make things clearer for you..
text:That is true. Maybe I just need to sit down and really think about it. The seeker feels negative about unemployment or financial situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to think about it in a positive way.	labels:I wouldn't stay if it really impacts your mental health in a negative way.

text:when we where younger we all hung out all the time now that we are older its like they talk with each other im not sure if i did anything or not. The seeker feels distant from her friends. The supporter should be able to tell the seeker that these friends are not the same and that they may not be the same in some way.	labels:Are you sure they are okay? Or not away with family for the holidays?
text:it doesnt matter they still keep open communication with each other . The seeker feels alone and alone. It is very lonely.	labels:That's no good what do you think the problem is?
text:I believe its because I am the friend that has financial trouble and normally needs to borrow money. The seeker feels concerned and worried about family members not being around. In the supporter's conversation, the seeker could help the supporter by asking the seeker to do something with their family.	labels:Do you owe someone already?

The supporter could suggest she should do an activity with friends to help her pay the bills.	labels:That can get in the way of a friendship sometimes, but I try not to get ahead of myself and  jump the gun. They may have lost a phone or something may have come up... That very well could be... Are you working?
text:no im not currently. I also think sometimes to myself that they don't answer because they think I'm asking for money.

It actually makes good sense.)... The seeker is worried about her job. The supporter could help her by getting her phone number so she can get help. In this conversation, the seeker is worried because she has to prove her identity and get an answer to the question "Is it OK to get a job."

The supporter can ask her a few questions. The supporter could also ask her a few questions about the studies and the company that she read about, and the company that the company will be based in.

text:Calling the customer service line is futile.  The computer just plays a recording that the agents are on other calls and then it disconnects the call. The seeker has been told that there is nothing else that can help her. The supporter could ask the seeker to apply for a charity or a food bank.	labels:I hear you there - I spent a long time on hold for an official matter the other day. I guess that everyone is really desperate for help and advice right now..
text:I have been very fortunate.  People in my church have been bringing me food.  I plan on trying to go to the food bank Monday, if they are open.

The supporter should also ask the seeker to check into the risk of being a candidate for a job.

text:I actually got so tired of redialing the Department of Labor and Training that I sent an email to the Lieutenant Governor of the state asking for his assistance in getting the matter resolved. The seeker feels frustrated because the support is trying to help her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should call the state government office to get the assistance she needs.	labels:That sounds like a very positive thing to have done. I really hope that they pay some attention to you. This situation is not your fault!.
text:I have been to this food bank once before, and they actually made me feel very comfortable and welcomed and gave me an information package on other ways the parent organization may be able to assist me. The seeker feels welcomed and cares about help. The supporter could tell her that the organization has a big target, and the organization is trying to help.	labels:Yes they are run by lovely people.

The supporter could ask the seeker to find someone who has been to one of these programs.	labels:That sounds very encouraging! It's amazing what you can make even with cheap food. Noodles , for instance, are very versatile :).
text:You are right.  I am definitely not going to sit and pout.  I am just a bit frustrated with the system. The seeker is feeling frustrated that they are unable to find a job. The supporter could say that they are reading some books to help them out. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences.	labels:It's a very strange situation and I suspect that some of the authorities just feel overwhelmed and have no idea how to cope..
text:I am concerned that my boss may try to not take me back at my job.  Because this is an "at will" state, he can terminate me without cause.  Although he can not legally fire me for being ill with COVID, he can take me back and simply release me the same day saying that I have become redundant. The seeker feels a bit frustrated with the system. The supporter could tell the seeker to get out of the job and get another chance.	labels:That would be incredibly immoral of him. Do you feel that he is likely to do such a  thing?.
text:I would not put it past him.  Sadly.  But I have taken the attitude that if it does occur, there is nothing I can do to change the situation.  I would simply pursue a charge against him for wrongful termination, and seek a new job. The seeker feels that she would not do such a thing. The supporter should ask for some more details.	labels:That is a very rational way to look at things. I really hope that it does not come to thank though! Thank you for talking and I wish you all the best for the coming months.
text:I may not win the suit, but I would definitely file one.  In 2000, I had an employer fire me without cause.  I sued and won that time.  Not only did they have to pay me back wages for the 90 days that the investigation took place, which was no minor sum, The seeker feels vindicated and relieved that her boss is not going to take her back. The supporter could tell the seeker that she will not have to get another job and can focus on getting back on her feet.	labels:I am glad that you'd not roll over and accept ill treatment! Well done :).
text:they were found to be guilty, so the judge granted me my wages based on the average of 80 hour weeks I had been working, all my vacation time, plus the overtime I would have received, holiday pay, and then to put a nice bow on that gift, he awarded me 5000 dollars in damages because the old company lied and said I had broken the law. The seeker feels guilty of getting fired. The supporter can put a ring on this by telling the seeker that she was wrong in not believing them.	labels:I am afraid I need to leave now but thank you for talking :) (can you press the quit button and take the survey?) Best wishes!
text:My current employer actually knows this happened, because years ago we discussed it, and I showed him the award letter from the Department of Labor and Training, itemizing the judge's findings and the awards. Thank you for your time.  Have a great holiday. The seeker is congratulated for winning the lawsuit and being able to win the case. The supporter could tell the seeker that the judge is going to make sure to consider awarding the money.	labels:You too!.	episode_done:True

I have a lot of friends on facebook and similar that I can talk to..
text:I have few friends and can talk to but not sure how would they help. The seeker is worried about support network and wants to talk to friends but the supporter can tell she is not sure if they will help. She is stressed and can feel that she needs to talk to friends.	labels:Sometimes it does just make it easier to know that other people are in the same situation as you :).
text:You mean share experiences among the friends? The seeker feels comforted after the friend. The supporter could remind the seeker that there are people to help her.	labels:Yes .. or at least share coping mechanisms perhaps?. Do you have any hobbies that you can occupy yourself with right now?.
text:Yes, I pay musical instruments but do to COVID could not play with the band. The seeker is not sure what to do. The supporter could suggest the seeker to invite her friends to the show. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to help her friends get therapy.	labels:Could you perhaps set up Zoom meetings where you could play together online?.
text:Any idea how would it work? Would there be any delay between the sounds from different instruments? The seeker feels that there is a delay between the sounds from the different instruments. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a Zoom meeting.	labels:No I don't think so :) I think that it is totally live so you could play just as you would if you were together in person..
text:Thanks for the idea. I will give it a try. The seeker is feeling lonely and stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter might ask the seeker to put a little effort into the conversation.	labels:I hope it goes well for you. It has been such an awful year, hasn't it?.

I hope that you get to get together with your band again and rock!.
text:I hope so. As they started the vaccination everything should come back to normal in few months... Thanks for your time and support. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could offer some reassurance to the seeker. The seeker could also offer to meet with a therapist.	labels:Yes, all we need to do is be patient! Have a great New Year and thanks for talking..	episode_done:True
text:Hello, what is life like for you at the moment?.\nInfinitely complicated. Too many decisions. I don't know what to do. The seeker feels confused by the supporter's question. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a way to be more organized.	labels:I am sorry to hear that but I am happy to listen and help you if I can. what sort of things are you trying to decide?.
text:I don't even know where to start. I'm trying to decide if I can build trust with him again. He lied about everything. The seeker is really trying to decide if she should move forward with the boyfriend. The supporter should help her by making her focus on the things she can control when deciding what to do with her life.	labels:Well, let's try to take it one problem at a time so's not to get overwhelmed. What is your biggest problem at the moment?. Ah, am I to take it that a relationship has recently ended?.
text:When we met, before we got involved, he said he was divorced. I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He assured me that they were just a pen's stroke away from being divorced. That was in March. I found out three weeks ago that they're actually still living together. ANd, no. We haven't broken up yet. The seeker feels the relationship is ending. The supporter could say there is no need to stay together because they are just a few strokes away from divorce. The supporter could also say that they don't really care about standing between the seeker and her boyfriend.	labels:Ah I totally hear you .. the old 'we're getting divorced' line. I've been in that one! You are well out of this..
text:I'm debating. I don't know what to do. I feel like a schmuck. He has such pretty words. The seeker feels confused because of the words. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:From personal experience I think that if they say they're going to get divorced and then drag their feet it is never going to happen..
text:And he invests so much time and effort into us. I agree with you. My mind agrees. My stupid emotions are clouding things. The seeker is trying to decide what to do after the breakup with her boyfriend. The supporter can give the seeker advice, suggest the seeker to talk to friends and family, and set up time schedule.	labels:Well, if you were to give him an ultimatum what do you think he would say?.
text:I did. LOL. The seeker feels frustrated because she doesn't know what to do. The supporter could help her by asking her to try to have a conversation with her boyfriend. The supporter could also tell her that she can't do it alone. The supporter could also tell her that if she wants a relationship with her boyfriend, she should ask him to talk to her.	labels:And he's still married?.
text:And he brought his kids to my house so they could meet my kids. He had a conversation with them about why he and their mother had been living the way they had. (in seperate floors of the house) That was two weeks ago. So, yes, he is. Too soon to tell. The seeker believes her husband is a schmuck. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has been a schmuck for a long time. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the problem is the situation.	labels:I can tell that you feel that you are being cheated here. I can't tell you what to do but don't you think you deserve better?.
text:I guess that's what I'm trying to figure out. Should I give him time to prove himself now that he's backed into a corner. The seeker feels that he is being cheated. The supporter could talk to the seeker to ask if they should give him time to prove himself.	labels:It's not for me to say but I wonder if he's really going to change as he has not already..

The seeker feels made for the supporter. The supporter should explain that the seeker is worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could also tell the seeker to ask her friends and family to help her with the situation.	labels:How do your children feel about this? And his?.
text:MY children (6 and 9) have been living with him in their lives as a male figure who is growing into a father figure. He and I have been together for fifteen months, and part-time living together for six. This isn't a new relationship. That's part of the complication, too. His kids actually asked if they could come live with me while he and his (ex?) figured their shit out. The seeker is worried that the support will not be there to help her. The supporter should try to reassure the seeker that their kids will be fine. The supporter could also say it's a good thing that the kids will be with their dads.	labels:Yes, I can imagine that it is. It is always really difficult when children are involved. I know you would not want your children to be hurt.

DOesn't want to have anything to do with her kids (5, 9, 11, 13) The seeker feels that Covid lied to her as a result of his extracurricular activities.

text:I would all but guarantee it. The seeker seems scared about her relationship with her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get help from friends or family.	labels:It just worries me that he might treat you the same way if you were ever in the same position.
text:Here's the other kicker, though... She knows about me. (I know. You're right. I thought that as well) The seeker feels that Covid is a liar. The supporter should try to reach out to her. The supporter could tell the seeker that Covid is an awful person. The supporter could also tell the seeker that Covid makes her feel uncomfortable, and that this was in part because of the lies. The supporter could also tell the seeker that Covid needs to stop the lies.	labels:And how does she feel about you?.
text:She doesn't care. She just wants to keep the status quo. She likes the money and security. (before he was furloughed, he made very good money.) The seeker feels resentful about the situation and feels that Covid has made her feel that way. The supporter can tell the seeker that Covid is a nice guy but it is not fair.	labels:I think it would be better if he  were able to come to a sensible financial solution with her. This situation is damaging for everyone..

It must be overwhelming at times and make you dread the weekends. It sounds like it has become a habit for your ex. It might help if you write a letter to them explaining that you are ready to move on and are asking them to do the same. Explain that you are giving them the opportunity to stop harassing you in the following ways [list some of the details you have documented]. Inform them that if they do not stop, you are considering taking it further regarding harassing communications and that this letter serves as your intention to no longer tolerate their actions. Send it via certified mail and keep a copy. This will give them no way to immediately respond and would be the first step of official documentation should they decide to continue.  Do you think that might help?
text:I think that is an excellent idea! That is a good way to end this once and for all. The seeker feels upset because the supporter should ask if they are going to be able to stop harassing the seeker. The supporter could mention that it is cute to see the seeker harassing them and that that could be helpful for the seeker to have some clues about that.	labels:I sincerely hope it is a step toward you regaining your control  over how you are able to interact with people.

While I know jobs are scarce right now, do you think you might consider at least taking a look at some job sites, doing some searches just to see if there are some other jobs you might be interested in?
text:Yes, that's really frustrating. I find myself biting my tongue more than once every day when I hear his opinions about the work. The seeker is frustrated because of his new manager. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to coworkers, ask the seeker to talk to managers and ask the seeker to discuss with the manager.	labels:Oh yes, I totally get that!

The supporter should ask the seeker to bring the feelings to the discussion.	labels:It is understandable to want to keep photos.

The supporter should understand the seeker does not want to leave her boyfriend, but the seeker is wanting to not leave her boyfriend. She is asking for space and time to process her emotions. The supporter could try to make space for the seeker by saying something in a comforting way to avoid any painful feelings.	labels:Yes, it must be a painful experience.

I believe that you can manage this experience and end up a stronger person.	episode_done:True
text:Hi! The seeker is not having any contact with the supporter.

text:It is a spot not filled by humans. Yes. I suppose. Maybe even two would be better. The seeker feels lonely because of not having the bestie. The supporter should help the seeker regain her bestie.	labels:I completely agree.  Having a dog as a companion has been a life saver to me in so many situations.
text:I would want him to have a friend this time. What kind of dog do you have? The seeker is a dog lover and wants to have a friend. The supporter should tell the seeker to ask a friend that is a dog lover. It could also say that the dog is a schnauzer.	labels:Having a playmate for the dog will make it easier to justify leaving when you do need to go back to work in the office.  The puppy won't be lonely. I have a yellow lab!  He's great!

text:Not so good. I have conspiracy theorist as a friend who is now mad at me because I told her to pull up her mask while talking to me. We have been friends for 13 years.

When you say your friend does not believe in the virus, what is her stance on it?
text:She thought it was faked for political reasons at first. Then when she found out it was real when it struck close to home, she is saying it is apart of population control. Honestly she is all over the place. I find her very dangerous to others right now. I don't think our friendship will survive this because I am willing to part ways for all of our safety. I hate that but will do it.\ The seeker has sided with the supporter and told her story about the conspiracy theory. The supporter can tell the seeker the conspirator's story is serious and that she should not be involved in this. The supporter can also tell the seeker the story is not about the conspirator's alliance with the government, but about the conspiracy theory itself.	labels:I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts. As my friends started working on those units and my members being hospitalized for it, I surrendered my political stance and dawned my mask. I have a friend who is just like your friend, they have politicized it and had first degree exposure and blew up when we had her sit out of our teen support group/youth group and church services for two weeks. She is in her 50's. I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts.

Because it brought up feelings from when I was growing up and neglected. It took a long time, and it ...wasn't a clean break. I just got tired of feeling bad, and the relationship just waned..

Another suggestion is to remind yourself why you need to wake up and get things going! For me, I know I want to help others in the future but without the degree I am going for, I would not be able to help.
text:That sounds very simple and useful. I'm not sure its practical for me since I live on my own and have to worry about paying my bills, I have very little assistance..

The supporter could tell the seeker to do some research on places that are available for international students.	labels:I think the best thing in these situations is to take time doing things that make you happy.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker should either have a long term relationship or get a job that would allow her to improve her career.	labels:That's really hard, especially when there's chance it could have worked out if it wasn't for the distance.

When hanging with them and they do not want to change, sometimes the best thing to do is to walk away and let them hit bottom.  I have 2 brothers that DID find recover and a sister too.

text:Hello, how are you doing today? The seeker did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Im okay how are you?
text:I am glad you are doing okay, I am struggling with my current employer which has brought me an area of anger and sadness. The seeker is aware that she is struggling with her current job. The supporter should ask her what her thoughts are on the issue.	labels:Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?
text:My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months. The seeker is feeling stressed and is worried about the work situation. The supporter could explain that the seeker worries about not getting a job.	labels:So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?
text:Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial. The seeker is stressed because of a bad decision in their job. The supporter could suggest to take some time off to escape the stress.	labels:Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all... Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?
text:I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit. The seeker feels like she has no hope in her job. The supporter could suggest a friend to talk to or a potential coworker to ask her about her current situation. The supporter should tell the seeker that the other positions that she is applying for are in different departments and that the security department may be a better fit. 	labels:That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.
text:I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms). The seeker is unhappy about being lied to and does not want to quit. The supporter can tell the seeker that they will not be able to help her, but they can help her. The supporter could also include a phone call to HR, which would be helpful.	labels:That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background..
text:I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point.  I loved what we stand for value wise, but  their values are not walked out. I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a "start today" option. The seeker feels bitter about the unfairness of being treated this way by the company. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is hope for her future career, but not her current situation. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should get a job looking for someone to help with her current situation.	labels:I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..
text:Sure links are always helpful (for the record, I left the employer and work for fabulous healthcare company now that I have been with for two years). Do you run during the winter when it is cold, or do you have different coping strategies for the winter time. It is 8 degrees where I am at. The seeker has told her supporter that she would like to talk about her stress. The supporter can help her understand that stress comes from many areas including the way she feels about work, the time she spends in the hospital, the job situation, the family situation, and the religious situation. She should ask for more specifics about each stressor.	labels:I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever. Wow that is cold.. I could not run in that what so ever...Do you have a gym?	episode_done:True

The supporter could suggest that the seeker could try to get more motivation with the help of a friend.	labels:hi i am sorry to hear that. what are they trying to shame you with? what are they trying to shame you with?
text:It is Christmas and my friends say that I do not donate enough to charity. They are putting me on a guilt trip.  My one old friend is the President of a local non-profit. The seeker feels guilty about being naughty with charity. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her friends about donating. The supporter could also say that it is okay to feel guilty.	labels:well, the donation to charity should be what either you can affort or volunteeer, it all depends on your situation.
text:I am not making much income with the COVID-19, either. The seeker feels guilty because of the situation. The supporter should ask the seeker if they would be able to make that amount of money. The supporter could also ask the seeker to join a study group if they are feeling stressed.	labels:it has to come from the heart and if your circumstances do not allow that then they should not talk badly about you.
text:Two different (so-called) friends of mine need to get a life. The seeker feels guilty and feels the need to talk about their friend. It is hard to get a hug or a hug the supporter should be able to empathize with the seeker's experience.	labels:shame on them to do that to you. well you might not consider them real friends if that is what they do. it is always easier to judge over other people then to validate what anyone self is doing.
text:Yeah, people don't know that just because my two friends go "Way back," does not mean they should be able to to hurt me, emotionally. What should I do about these two (so-called) friends?. The seeker feels betrayed because of the two friends hurt by the other friend. The supporter could suggest that the seeker ask another friend to be a friend to the other friend. The supporter could also ask the seeker to not talk to the other friend because they are not listening to them.	labels:definatly not  ...have you tried explaining your situation to them?
text:No, they don't know that I am in financial trouble myself. COVID-19 has wrecked my steady income levels.... Things were great, this time last year. The seeker feels that she is not able to be friends with anyone. The supporter could remind the seeker that the COVID-19 is a non-profit and that the friend should be able to provide opportunities to take a break.	labels:well i know thats something most people do not want to disclose can you help the organization with donating your time?
text:I might be able to do that. The seeker feels vulnerable because of her situation. The supporter should remind her and tell her to talk to her friends about her situation.	labels:unfortunatly it is right now very comen this situation, so no shame for that,
text:Well, I used to donate a LOT in year's past. The seeker has not told her story to her supporting friend. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her friend. She should also ask the supporter to talk to her friend. The supporter should also try to talk to the seeker to see if she has any ideas.	labels:a lot of times donating time to help organisatiosn is more valuable then money.
text:Great point. The seeker feels guilty about not being able to afford the COVID-19. The supporter could help the seeker feel guilty about not having enough to give.	labels:times and situations change so thats ok.
text:My friends may like to know that I am trading time....instead of donating money. The seeker feels that she was being blamed for making the decision to donate money. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not the only one who has done this. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker could consider making some money for the non-profit.	labels:i worked for a non profit and the biggest struggle was to find volunteers to help out.
text:Yes, you make a good point. The seeker feels that she might lose more than she earns if she doesn't donate to the organization. The supporter could suggest that she just needs to find other ways to support the organization.	labels:I feel that is a great donation and if they do not like that tell them money is easy to give time not.
text:The proble is that some people just want to shame people without knowing their plight. The seeker is stressed about time and time is short. The supporter could say that this is a situation where time is short and it is hard to find volunteers. It is also hard to find volunteers because the seeker has not been able to find friends or a group to talk to.	labels:Yeah, true, we need to stay above them then in all actuality  we don't know what goes on behind closed doors in their life. sometimes people like that reflect.
text:I need to think of others ways to contribute that won't have my friends hating on me. I have pride, too. The seeker wants to think of others ways to contribute. The supporter should suggest that the seeker think of ways to contribute to the organization. The seeker could also talk to family.	labels:BUt it should be what you want not what your 'freinds want. you should be proud of yourself.
text:Yeah...... The seeker is embarrassed about not having money. The supporter can tell the seeker that most people have a lot of money. The supporter could also tell the seeker that most people have a lot of things that are important to them.	labels:Hopefully next year will bring better things and maybe even a better friend that does not judge into your life.
text:The problem is that I am not sure it my friends are going to believe me; I am a well-to-do individual. We can only hope for a better 2021. Not sure how quickly the markets rebound.... The seeker feels guilty about not donating money to charity, but the supporter could show her how to do that. She can also tell the seeker that if it is not for charity she should think about doing something for herself.	labels:well if they do not believe you as well you might really need to rethink your friendships and the meaning in those so called freind ships. hopefully soon for all of us, but hold on to the thought of being healthy.
text:Well, I usually go to their get-togethers. Both of my friends are well-to-do. The seeker says that she usually go to social functions. The supporter could tell the seeker that the good things will be there. The supporter could also tell the seeker that they can go to the social functions with their friends. The supporter could also tell the seeker that they can go with their friends to the place.	labels:I am hoping you will find the right solution.
text:Well, you have been helpful. Thank you. Good bye. The seeker has been helpful and has found the right solution. The supporter could encourage the seeker to find friends who can help her.

The supporter could also use a journal to write down the thoughts that are being felt.	labels:Have you tried to talk to your kids about that?
text:I'm thinking of taking away devices, but then Corona is still here. I feel that is very mean considering they are already stressed being in doors. Talking is great when we are doing it and they all agree. But it never stays this way. The seeker talks about her son's behavior. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk to her son.	labels:Maybe that will be a good thing because it might make them wished they had listened to you and won't do it again,

text:I feel that is abusive when I know how bad they are being affected psychologically. I actually feel like just locking them in their rooms until we get done working.

The supporter can tell the seeker that he and his kids are in a bad situation.	labels:How about reward them with something if they listen and behave.

text:I appreciate your support and maybe I will take them to the park where we all play family games but just with us four. They really love to do that. I think that they want attention from us more because we are right here. Or maybe we'll have a picnic together. It has been awhile since we have done something outside of the house together. The seeker feels that it is unethical to send her kids outside of her house. The supporter could ask the seeker to have a conversation about that because she has been stressed about having to be there for her family.	labels:Yes maybe that will work for them and probably want to be outside.
text:I feel it is like pent up frustration. They were very very busy before Corona. The seeker experiences frustrated and is concerned about how they will be able to get everything done without a lot of help. The supporter should remind the seeker that if she does not take them to the park, she will be punished for not doing her job.	labels:I understand the corona has messed everything up this year.
text:Do you have kids? The seeker is asking how the corona messed her up. The supporter could say that they were super busy before Corona came into the picture. The supporter could also say that they had kids before Corona came into the picture.	labels:are they having a good Christmas. No i have no kids but want some one day.
text:They are SUPER happy today of course. Luckily they have received the same amount of presents they get any other Christmas because our income has stayed the same. These kids do not know how lucky they are right now. Maybe I can stress that to them a well. They need to know they have a lot to be grateful for. Thanks for your ear and your help! I hope you have an awesome christmas and please stay safe! The seeker feels grateful for being able to receive the same amount of presents as an average family.	labels:Right i understand that. Just talk to them and be firm with them that will get them to listen more. Your welcome. Have a awesome Christmas to and stay safe to.	episode_done:True

You might be intererested in that..
text:Ok. I am glad to talk with you. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter should give the seeker ideas on ways to cope with the depression. The supporter should also talk to the seeker about ways to deal with the depression.	labels:I could only see that in movies. wow, so scary.
text:Lots of my Marine buddies have had PTSD. Women and men alike. Women are also joining the Marines.... The seeker feels scared about the Marines. The supporter should try to work on assigning the seeker to a Marine support group or a Marine unit.	labels:I think your minds have deep scar. It needs healing.

The supporter could tell the seeker that some jobs are better than others and that there is nothing wrong with her career path.	labels:How was your career path different?

The seeker feels alone, lonely, and concerned about her career path. The supporter could suggest that the seeker find a new career path that would be more suitable for her.	labels:She did not like your career path?
text:I am thinking that would be the case, however we dated for 3 years and then reconnecting about a year later which at this time was a distant relationship.

I am unsure what to think, but she did say that she just didn't see how our career paths would work out and that was that. The seeker mentions that she has a boyfriend and then the supporter could tell her that she has a boyfriend, but not the romantic type. The supporter could also tell the seeker she does not live in a romantic relationship.	labels:If anything she was supposed to support whatever career path you took  and that is not right. It is weird to me also how she got into another relationship fast after she broke up with you just 2 months after.
text:I have had some friends echo that. I agree, it definitely felt like I was giving a lot through the time we dated. I have always wondered if this was a true statement, knowing her I think she probably got scared of what that entailed or just the distance. The new boyfriend was definitely a wild card, that I think has caused me to question her parting words. The seeker feels scared about her career path because she is concerned about her future career path. The supporter could advise the seeker to think about it for a few months.	labels:Right but to be honest I would not let that stress you out or be upset about it because you do not need anybody that don't support your career. I would just move on and let it go and focus on your self.
text:I appreciate your feedback on this, (this event for context occurred about a year ago and I have moved on from it) my support system has said the same thing. I think the difficult part is just overcoming that mental/emotional hurdle of having the desire to marry her, which failed since it was an expectation of what was to come. I appreciate your suggestions. I think being the best "me" will help equip me for my future spouse! :) The seeker feels stressed and anxious but the reasons are not stated. The supporter could tell the seeker that her problems are unique and she needs to do something about it. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to friends and ask some similar experiences.	labels:Right i can understand how you are feeling. We all have been in a situation where we have the desire to marry someone and all that fails. I have been in a situation like that.

He told me not to take it personally because it is just lust and that he loves me only. The seeker feels betrayed by her spouse. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is in a position of power and she is what keeps her husband faithful. She could also tell the seeker that she is angry and disappointed at her husband for cheating.	labels:since when have you guys been together.
text:Actually, today is our 4th year anniversary. The seeker feels that she wants someone to cheat on and is disappointed that she can't have someone else. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find a friend or a girlfriend and have it out with it.	labels:that's a long time..
text:Yes I guess he just wants a change. The seeker feels like someone is trying to hold back from saying no to him. The supporter could suggest that the seeker can talk to her husband to ask him what the situation is.	labels:have you guys seen a therapist.
text:No but I am thinking about i. it* The seeker feels angry that a guy asked her out on a date. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek professional help and see if that helps.	labels:every relationship has it's ups and down, just make sure you guys talk to an expert and make reason out of this .. therapy has help my relationship a great deal.
text:I will definitely look into it. You are a great listener and I feel better now that I spoke to someone about this issue. The seeker is angry because of the cheating. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not being honest with her partner. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her therapist.	labels:good, and make sure you are not too visibly angry at him for telling you. just help him trough the process.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there and Happy Holidays! I hope you are feeling okay at the moment?.\nI am not, this is a very hard time of the year for me. The seeker feels stressed because of the exam pressure. The supporter could suggest a time to relax and call friends to relax. The supporter could also offer to help the seeker to unwind.	labels:I am really sorry to hear that. Please know that I am happy to listen and to help you if I can!.
text:Thank you for that.  I really miss my girlfriend. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could mention that there are other people in the room.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. Have you separated or can you just not be together at Christmas?.
text:We are separated.  She said I was watching too much Buzzr and didn't pay enough attention to her, so she dumped me. The seeker is separated and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could also say that the seeker was watching too much and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could also say that the seeker was watching too much and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could also say that the seeker was watching too much and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could also say that the seeker was watching too much and the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could also say that the seeker was watching too much and the reason	labels:That is not good. But relationships can be reestablished if you talk. Have you considered seeing a third party to help you both talk this out?.
text:We tried to see a counselor.  It did go too well, the counselor took her side on everything, it was very unprofessional. The seeker does not tell the supporter to tell her about her relationship problems, but the supporter could tell her about her part of the relationship issues, why she thinks she will never be with her boyfriend, as well as the fact that she thinks that she is not doing well in her job.	labels:I seem, so do I hear you saying that you feel that everyone is against you on this and that you feel powerless?.
text:It feels like that way.  Even my parents seem to support her more than me.  I am all alone now watching a Buzzr marathon with no one to truly support me. The seeker feels the pressure on her from the supporter. The supporter could ask the seeker to seek professional help.	labels:I am sorry that your parents are not being more supportive. I understand how hard it is when you have a break up and loved ones seem to support your ex!.
text:Has this happened to you before? The seeker is about to get support. The supporter can say that he or she has been there, been with the seeker and helped her through her break up. The supporter could also ask the seeker how is the relationship.	labels:Please know that you are not alone in this situation and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.. Yes it has .. my boyfriend left me for someone else and most of our mutual friends took his side!.
text:I am sorry to hear that, I think your boyfriend made a big mistake leaving you, you seem like a very nice and sweet person. The seeker feels like someone is against her and that she is powerless. The supporter could encourage the seeker to seek professional help.	labels:Thank you :) I am sure that there is someone else out there for you too if you cannot reconcile with your ex. The question is, how much do you really want to? You might be better off without her.
text:That might be true, she really blew it with me, I am a good catch. The seeker feels being alone. The supporter could tell the seeker that no one is helping her. The supporter could also suggest some resources to become a better person.	labels:That is a good way to think! Never let something like this destroy your self esteem..
text:I agree.  You know, you are very good at this.  Did you end up finding a new boyfriend or husband? The seeker is bothered by the breakup. The supporter should mention something positive in the conversation to help the seeker. This could include a gift or another friend or something like that.	labels:Yes, I am engaged now. I realise that my ex did me the biggest favour anyone ever could!.
text:Well that is a good success story!  Thank you for the motivation. The seeker is happy to hear that she is engaged. The supporter could ask the seeker if the seeker has ever been engaged or if the seeker is still single. The supporter could also ask the seeker how much time they think they need to get married.	labels:Maybe you should think about talking to a counsellor or something about this, just to work through your feelings?.
text:Yes I will do that.  Thank you for your support. The seeker feels she is not alone, but not powerful. The supporter could help her to feel powerful.	labels:You are most welcome. I have a few minutes left to talk if there's anything else on your mind?. How is life treating you otherwise?.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\nHi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better. The seeker says she is feeling sad and lonely. The supporter could try to talk to her about being sad and lonely.	labels:So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?
text:Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough. The seeker has a ton of stress and seems to not be able to keep it down. The supporter should suggest the seeker to take a break from school and go out to eat. The supporter could also suggest to the seeker to start a study group to talk about topics. The supporter can also ask the seeker to talk to a friend.	labels:I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?
text:I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot. The seeker feels stressed because of school and the answer is more than enough. The supporter should help the seeker to be more cheerful and not stressed.	labels:Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that.. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.
text:Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating. The seeker is stressed because she hasn't done enough work. The supporter could suggest the seeker not to procrastinate. She could also add a note about the purpose of her work and what she does to get better in class and be more motivated.	labels:Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.
text:Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school. The seeker feels stressed and worries about being stressed. The supporter could try to tell the seeker how to feel good about herself. The supporter could also try to help the seeker with things that make her feel good.	labels:Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.
text:Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe. The seeker feels overwhelmed and is concerned about getting too far ahead in school. The supporter could tell the seeker about the checklists that are available. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to stay in school longer to help her reach her goals.	labels:Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books.. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *
text:I have 6 classes. The seeker talks about her classes. The supporter should give the seeker a plan to help her schedule. Maybe she should go to the gym, go to the library, ask friends, and do a little test of her performance.	labels:That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject.  Like a chore chart..
text:Yes haha. That is a good comparison. You have been super helpful. I will for sure try to use your advice. Thank you! Have a great day and thanks again. The seeker has a list of things to do before getting to class today. The supporter could tell the seeker that they need to talk to friends or go out to eat. The supporter could also suggest trying to work on a couple of things during class.	labels:You are quite welcome! God bless have a great day!	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How can I encourage you today? Hello? Anyone there?\nHi sorry. I'm having trouble getting motivated to finish my senior thesis. The seeker feels motivated to finish her thesis because it is a big project. The supporter could ask her to learn some new strategies to overcome the stress.	labels:Ah! I remember my thesis, a lot of work. One thing for certain, I have a lot of pride over my accomplishment, it was well worth it. When is it due?
text:In about a month. The seeker feels motivated to do her thesis because of the supporter's efforts. It is also a great opportunity for the supporter to get her thesis done.	labels:I'm sure you will be able to finish it, sometimes we find ourselves in a slump and need some fresh air blown our way.. Do you have an advisor who is holding you accountable?
text:Yes, but I've been really bad about keeping her in the loop. I feel bad when I fall behind, and then I'm fearful of getting back in touch with her. The seeker is afraid of falling behind because of being kept in the loop. The supporter could ask the seeker to get in touch with the advisor.	labels:Whenever I have a large project and lose motivation, I set my goals on paper, then break it down into smaller bites. For example, I will make sure I work one hour on certain days, or call a friend, I generate ideas to keep me on track. Yes, I sometimes feel guilty and then don't want to face the music, but actually the best thing to do is recognize you are NOT the first person she knows that got behind. So she is surely experienced with people who need some encouragement. She is the BEST person to go to, actually.
text:That sounds like a good idea regarding putting it down on paper. The seeker feels guilty because she wants to be the first person she knows about getting in contact with a friend to speed up the process of getting back on track. The supporter could give the seeker a reminder to keep it down to the bare minimum.	labels:It has always helped me. For example, you can break it down into 4 weeks, then each week write your goals -- maybe put call Advisor or go stop by every week, but I would put that first for the first week. Then as you check off items, you will see you are moving, even if at a snail's pace, you are moving, and that always encourages me. Sometimes I do not realize how much I AM doing, until I see it on paper. Paper doesn't lie, but my emotions sometimes cloud my thinking.
text:My other problem is that I'm a perfectionist. I tend to over-analyze and get bogged down, especially when doing research. The seeker feels perfectionist because it reminds her of her childhood trauma. The supporter could say the seeker needs to be more realistic.	labels:Another idea is rewards, when you finish one goal, perhaps put a reward for yourself,  a yogurt with sprinkles or something like that. You sound like me! I had to learn that I need to strive for EXCELLENCE, not perfection. Perfection will drain us. Do the best I can, leave the rest to God.. That is why a time line is good. For example, you make a goal that you will work on your reference and citation page for one hour, after that, you are DONE, If you have time at the end, you can revisit it. The hour is my suggestion, you make your own. lol THAT way, you don't get caught going on and on for 6 hours to make it perfect. One hour is reasonable..
text:That definitely sounds reasonable. Putting micro deadlines in might be what I need to do to keep me focused. The seeker is motivated to work on her research and make a reference. The supporter could suggest the seeker to work on that and then bring it back to the support group.	labels:I do this with EVERYTHING in life because I tend to go on and on too focused and lose track of everything. lol For example, I clean each room for 15 minutes a week. If it needs more, I do more, but I set the timer and you would be surprised how well that works, otherwise, I will spend all my time perfecting one room and the rest is a mess. Also, your Advisor will know tips to help you too. She has advised a lot of people, her objectivity and experience can give get RIGHT to the heart of any problem, quickly too.
text:My advisor is a tough woman, I'm not going to beat around the bush. She tends to make everything miserable. The seeker feels resentful, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could tell the seeker to change the way she is looking at her advisor. The supporter could also tell the seeker to stop making that decision in her head and get it done.	labels:Tough advisors are TOUGH. lol But You sound intelligent and you obviously WANT to do this, it is a goal of yours, I'm sure you can take it!.
text:I'll try to keep that in mind. It's something I do feel like I need to finish for my own sake. The seeker is being discouraged by the advisor. The supporter should ask the seeker to see a counselor and ask the counselor what advice they would give the seeker. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she needs to find a partner, but she needs to do it now.	labels:It is only one more month of your life. If you buckle down, it will be over and done with before you know it. And I assure you, you will look back in pride at your accomplishments!
text:That sounds like a wonderful feeling. But so far away. The seeker feels very afraid about the deadline for her thesis. The supporter could give the seeker the deadline for a month to complete the work. She should add that the advisor is the best advisor, and he will help you get there.	labels:My Graduation Day was amazing.  This is what life is about, working NOW for rewards later. It's like a garden, you sow, you weed, you wait for rain and weed some more. You keep waiting and weeding, then later harvest come. It takes time to work a little each day, then time passes whether you lay on your bed or whether you are in the garden working. If you lay on your bed, you get nothing, if you work a little every day, in time, you reap rewards..
text:That's a very poetic way of putting it. The seeker feels that she is only just starting out in life and needs to work on her goals to get ahead. The supporter should give her a reward for her hard work.	labels:Not much in life is easy or free, if we keep working little by little, as time passes, you real a lot of rewards, in fact, you will reap rewards of finishing this thesis for YEARS even decades. It is a great goal and a worthy one to keep at..
text:I'll keep that in mind as I move forward. I really appreciate your help. The seeker feels how hard her life is going and doesn't know how to stop. The supporter could help the seeker to focus on the goals that she is working on. The supporter could also write her a letter and let her know how she is doing. The supporter could also ask her to go to her advisor and ask her to let her know how she is doing.	labels:I commend you for doing the thesis and I also know it can get weary as time passes, but with some goals on paper a visit to the ADVISOR (hee hee) will set you up right for continued success.. You are very welcome. Have a blessed evening!!.	episode_done:True
text:Good evening, how are you feeling today?.\nI am feeling okay I am kind of stressed. How are you? The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to stress with the things they can control. The supporter could also suggest that they show how stressful the situation really is by being relaxed and relaxing.	labels:I am sorry, I gather life is not going well for you right now? Would you like to talk about it?.
text:Yes I would. The seeker feels stressed because she is feeling pressure. The supporter could tell the seeker to start an online support group. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should look into a journal or a journal for free.	labels:I am more than happy to listen and to help if I can. I do know how bad things can get at this time of year..
text:I am sad and even depressed about my life at the moment its hard to find a job and I am scared to open myself up to this guy I met. The seeker is sad, but the supporter knows that her job situation is not making things better. The supporter can tell the seeker to get a job, but it will not be easy for the seeker.	labels:Let's take things one at a time .. have you lost your job recently?.
text:No. it is hard finding one. The seeker feels sad and depressed because the supporter is talking to her. The supporter can tell the seeker that he has lost his job. The supporter could suggest that the seeker find a job.	labels:Yes, I can understand that jobs are very hard to come by right now.
text:Yes they are but I at least have friends to talk to for help. The seeker is not sure her boyfriend is being supported. The supporter could also ask her husband if she is having trouble finding a job. The supporter could tell her that she should talk to her husband and ask him to find a job.	labels:Well that is one positive thing. Can you tell me a little about the guy you are afraid to open up to?.
text:Well I met him on a dating site and he lives in France but he is also turkish i dont know much about turkish men but he says he loves me and he sees something with me but i barely know we only talking for few weeks now. The seeker feels fearful that he will lose his job. The supporter could say that it is time to open up to a friend.	labels:Well, I would recommend not taking things too quickly but relationships online CAN work - I met my fiance of ten years online..
text:oh that is wonderful. The seeker feels a lot of stress about her career. The supporter could tell the seeker to do activities such as volunteering, acting, and attending religious services. The supporter could also tell the seeker to view movies and go out on dates.	labels:But we did take it very slowly and talked for a year before we met in person..
text:i told him i dont want to rush things he fine with taking things slow but he does want me to take a chance with him. im 23 and he is 27 he is a positive sweet guy currently he is battling covid. The seeker is told that they are too young not to take things slow. The supporter could suggest to have sex with a guy who is in the same situation. If a guy is in a relationship, the supporter could ask if he is in a relationship.	labels:Well, if he is reliable then he will be happy to wait till you are ready to meet. Where do you live, do you mind me asking?.
text:I live in America and he live in France. The seeker is confused because she cannot tell the supporter if he is in a hurry and he is a friend or not. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is trustworthy and he is not rushing things.	labels:Ah well definitely do not contemplate meeting him whilst the pandemic is on! But it might be  good excuse to put things off for a bit, do you think?.
text:I would not be comfortable going to france during a pandemic I want to wait until everyone gets vaccinated first. The seeker is worried about her relationship with her boyfriend. The supporter can tell the seeker the pandemic is not good for her relationship.	labels:I do think that it might be a while before travel in Europe fully opens up again. Things are not good here..
text:u live in europe? The seeker has fallen in love with her friend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she seems a little afraid of her future life in france. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to apply to France for a job.	labels:I am in the UK. The pandemic is very bad here at the moment..
text:yeah I heard it is another strain there. The seeker is worried about going to France during pandemic. The supporter could explain why she is worried. She could also explain why she is worried.	labels:Two more! It's very scary and I don't recommend coming either here or continental Europe right now..
text:he understands that im not meeting him no time soon but when the pandemic is over I do not know if I should continue to pursue him or not. I dont even have a passport and i care about my health and others im not traveling for a long time. The seeker thinks that the pandemic is bad and that he is worried about meeting someone. The supporter can suggest the seeker to travel to Europe sometime before the pandemic is over. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to have a break from the work and see what things in France are like.	labels:So, I hear you saying that you are a bit wary of the relationship and do not know if it can work in the real world?.
text:Yes because I do not have experience with Turkish men and I am scared of him being controlling and abusive I guess its due to sterotypes i read about and heard. The seeker is concerned about being controlled by a man and avoiding being able to date. The supporter should walk through what he knows about the relationship, talk to the seeker about it, and decide if the relationship can be kept alive.	labels:Turkish people are lovely and welcoming - you should not worry about that :). But don't let yourself be pushed into anything you don't feel ready for.
text:Yes I agree with u have u met any turkish people? The seeker has met a Turkish person. The supporter ideally should ask the seeker to get more information about the Turkish partner, who lives in the UK.	labels:Yes I know a few Turkish people. They're very nice people, don't listen to any stereotypes!.
text:I think its also due to me being hurt before but scared of trying something new giving a new person a chance I have major trust issues. The seeker is worried about being hurt before trying a new relationship. The supporter could help the seeker to be honest about the reason for being hurt.	labels:I do understand how trying new things can be very difficult - this is something that I struggle with myself. But - if you don't take a chance, how can you know what might have happened?.
text:Yes I agree with u there. The seeker is feeling hurt about taking a chance on a new friend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should try to be careful. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get professional therapy.	labels:I really hope that I have been able to reassure you a little bit and help you to try to think things through. I wish you a very happy holiday season!.
text:thank you so much and happy christmas eve:) The seeker is reassured with the support from the supporter to try new things. The supporter can tell the seeker that they have good friends who will support her. The supporter could suggest a study group to have a chat.	labels:It's Christmas Day here now but you too!. Can you hit quit and take the survey? :).	episode_done:True
text:hellohow are you today.\nNot great. I'm feeling pretty down in the dumps. The seeker did not know what was the problem but the supporter should ask her to talk to her friends or her family.	labels:Im sorry to hear that. how can I help.
text:I'm not sure how, exactly. I'm dealing with repeated rejections. The seeker struggles with actual rejection. The supporter should suggest that she look for a professional therapist to help.	labels:That is always tough especially during this time of year and been there myself. What type of rejection  are you experiencing.
text:Romantic rejection. It seems like every time I make an effort, it's immediately shot down. The seeker feels rejected, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to do something to support the seeker.	labels:I hate to ask you this but are you male or female?
text:Male. Why do you ask? The seeker is feeling rejected by a romantic partner. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for help from a friend.	labels:I ask it changes the perception on how I may help you because male and females deal with things differently.
text:Fair enough. What do you suggest I try? The seeker is confused, but the supporter is correct because the seeker is male. The supporter should suggest the seeker to change her gender identity. The supporter should also suggest the seeker to find a new job.	labels:I am going to ask you a few questions if OK i don't want to sound like i am prying.
text:That's fine. I'm open to discussion. The seeker was being self conscious, so the supporter should tell her the reason of why she is feeling this way. For example, the supporter could tell the seeker she is not doing well academically, but she is a good person.	labels:OK do yo live in a rural or city, are you into male females or the like?
text:I'm in a rural area, and I'm interested in women. The seeker does like to talk with other women. The supporter needs to ask the seeker to find a group of women she likes.	labels:I too live in a rural area understand the complexities of tying to find someone. So my next question where looking to find that special connection.
text:I've had to resort to online dating and such as there are few opportunities to meet people in person. The seeker is having difficulty finding a connection on profile. The supporter should encourage her to talk to someone in person.	labels:I understand doing that I have tried it myself and trying to find that connection is few and far between. What sites have you tried using?
text:Basically all of the ones you would expect. How would you suggest meeting people in person? The seeker is looking for a good online dating site. The supporter could suggest that the seeker might try to find a virtual date or go online to meet people.	labels:Well It would depend on if you were religious I  would suggest church functions for example. I use my hobbies like pool and darts and cards and join groups that creates some common ground.
text:That sounds like a good idea. Do you attend meetups? The seeker feels like she is trying to meet someone in person. The supporter can tell that she is not comfortable with meeting someone in person.	labels:I have and i usually take someone i  trust with me and if it doesnt feel right I leave.
text:That's good advice. Thanks for your help. The seeker feels comfortable with the decision to use church functions, but the supporter could ask the seeker to find a group of people who are interested in her. The supporter could point out that she is a member of a group that is interested in meeting other seekers.	labels:No problem glad I could help. Is there anything else I can help with?	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels energized and confident about her career. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask her boss for some help, or ask her parents for more support.	labels:Hello, how are you at the moment? My name is Jo.
text:I am doing okay I suppose.. How are you?? The seeker feels anxious and is afraid to talk to the supporter. The supporter can tell the seeker it is okay to ask the supporter questions. The supporter can ask the seeker to take care of things around the house.	labels:I am not so bad. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about today?.
text:Yes. I had to throw out my sister the other day and Im kind of upset over it. The seeker is upset about the sister. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. What precipitated that, had you been having problems for a while?.
text:She was in a psych ward for a while and when it was time to discharge her, my mother didnt want her back. She was going to send her to a foster home so I volunteered to take her in. Since then, she has stopped taking her medication and is acting out. The seeker is upset about her sister because she does not want her back. The supporter should suggest to have a chat with her sister to find out why she is upset. The supporter could also suggest to have a chat with her mother to find out why she is upset.	labels:Ah, so you feel as though your mother could and should have helped and you were put into an impossible position you were not prepared for?.
text:Pretty much. The seeker feels as though she failed her mother. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her mother or to write her a letter.	labels:I can sympathise with you having siblings with extreme mental health problems - I have been there too and I know how difficult it is..
text:I tried to have  my mother take her back, but she still didnt want her there. So I sent her to my grandmothers and she turned that side of the family against me. The seeker is trying to get her mother back and is upset with the situation. The supporter could explain that after the situation in which the seeker was dealing with, the seeker was put into a difficult situation.	labels:Mentally ill people can unfortunately sometimes be manipulative, though they do not mean it. Have you had any contact with her since?.
text:Only once and she was just telling me that I was a horrible person. This all started over her stopping her meds and then I asked her to clean her room. The seeker feels that her mother should have helped her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should be able to talk to her and find support. The seeker could also ask the supporter to find and talk to other people who could help.	labels:That sounds very toxic. Is it possible to persuade her to seek medical help? I realise she might be reluctant to.
text:We have tried to get her into therapy again. But, COVID put a block on that. I suggested that she go back to the ward and maybe be placed into a group home. The seeker is trying to convince her mother not to send her to the psych ward and she is trying to get the supporter to help her.	labels:Ah yes, it is a terrible time at the moment isn't it? I think a lot of people are not getting the medical help that they need because of the virus. Please do not beat yourself up over this - it does sound as though you have done absolutely everything you could to help..
text:I would hate to see that happen, but Im at my wits end. The seeker would like to get help for her mother. The supporter could encourage the seeker to seek help for her mother. The supporter could also give the seeker advice about possible options for her mother.	labels:I can tell that you feel really bad about this just from your  tone of voice. Please remember that you can't fix everything in the world..
text:Now my dads side of the family hates me because they say Im "mean to her". All I asked her to do was to clean her room and maybe socialize every once in a while. Im more mad than sad. The seeker feels sad because she is not getting the help she needs. The supporter could remind her that she can't fix everything.	labels:Socialising can be hard for people with mental health problems. It might have been best if you did not press her too hard to do that though I know you did not realise..
text:I understand, but I think it would have better than sitting in a dark room all day. The seeker feels upset over going to therapy. The supporter can tell the seeker to talk to friends and look at other options.	labels:Does she suffer from depression also? That might account for her trying to shut herself away.
text:Yes, but she denies it whole heartedly. This is why she was taking medication. The seeker feels depressed, because of her mother. The supporter could tell the seeker that her mother has been suffering from depression. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to her mother about it, because sometimes people with depression talk about their mental health issues and this is not something that can be fixed by talking.	labels:I understand that it can be very difficult to make people take medication if they refuse to recognise that they have a problem..
text:I just wish she could she what I see... The seeker feels as though she has to be mad at her sister because of her drugs. The supporter should ask her if she has been depressed. Also, the supporter could talk to her about her drugs.	labels:Unfortunately that is not likely to be possible. All you can do is be kind to yourself and know that you really did try to help her.
text:I was afraid she was going to ruin my family with her attitudes. The seeker has a very bitter side to her. The supporter could tell that she thinks of her family as being hateful. The supporter could also tell the seeker to stop being so bitter.	labels:I hope that I have been able to help a little. I really appreciate that you felt that you could open up to me.
text:Thank you. I feel better being able to rant to someone. The seeker feels better about herself because she sees the supporter for help. If the seeker feels the supporter is not understanding her feelings, she should tell her that the supporter can help her.	labels:You're welcome. Have a lovely festive season! I feel that all will be better in the coming year.. You need to press quit from your end and take the survey :).	episode_done:True
text:Hello! Is there anything that you want to talk about today?.\nI need someone to talk to, I am sad. The seeker feels sad because her friend is not coming to her house. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to someone who is more advanced than her and get more motivation.	labels:I am really sorry to her that. I hope that I can help you a little. Would you tell me what the problem is?.
text:I really love my wife, but I also like other women. The seeker does not love her wife, but does like other women.	labels:Ah - so I hear you saying you are tempted to be unfaithful to your marriage vows?.
text:Yes.  I tried to see if she would let me sleep with other women from the Internet, and she is not allowing it. The seeker feels compelled to cheat on her husband because of the pressures of being a wife. The supporter could suggest the seeker to form a study group or visit a therapist.	labels:Well I must say that as a woman I would not allow it either ;).
text:Yes I would agree with that.  I guess I wanted my cake and be able to eat it too. The seeker would say that one of the reasons she is not allowed to sleep with other women is because she is a lesbian. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is a lesbian and if she is willing to talk about her problems with her husband.	labels:It does sound like it. Are there any other problems in your marriage that might be making you unhappy or is it generally okay and you just want someone else too?.
text:I am trying to get my wife to spice up our love-making and she is unwilling to do so, and that makes me super sad. The seeker feels like she has a problem with her husband, but she is not accepting his actions. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could try to find a new man or married couple.	labels:Have you considered getting some sort of marriage guidance counselling? There are people out there who might be able to help you both.
text:Why would we need counseling to spice up a love life?  That should come naturally, is it hard for women to make that change? The seeker feels misunderstood by the supporter. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is not a marriage counsellor. The supporter could also address the seeker's concerns about being unfaithful.	labels:I think it sounds as though you might be pushing her into things she is not ready for though. Have you considered that you might be the problem?.
text:That is what makes me sad, I know I am the problem.  I am a piece of trash, she is way better than me.    I hate myself. The seeker is not happy about being trapped in a relationship that is not for her. The supporter could add something to the conversation.	labels:No, I do not think you should say that! At least you recognise that you are not behaving well, which is the first step on the road to making things better..
text:Maybe I have a sex addiction.  I think I watch too much pornography and it gives me weird ideas for sex. The seeker is told that the sex addiction might be due to porn and that the sexual thoughts are coming from a porn addiction. The supporter could encourage the seeker to get help.	labels:Perhaps you could consider individual counselling to overcome your own problems before you think of couples' therapy?. Porn can be helpful for a relationship but it can also be damaging..
text:Just for me?  I hope I get a male counselor because if it was a female one, I would probably want to sleep with her. The seeker is not sure if she is trying to fix her own issues or if she is trying to get a relationship with a male to go forward. The supporter could suggest a male counselor.	labels:Well, perhaps it would be better for you to learn that you can't just do that even though you want to :).
text:Yes, I can't control my impulses.  I am picturing what you look like now and imagining what we would do together.  I think I have a big problem. The seeker feels that she is not a good person like her husband. The supporter could suggest to help her get out of the situation.	labels:I am forty five, fat and married :). I do recommend talking to someone though..
text:I am forty one, fat and married.  I actually prefer heavier ladies, but I get your point.  :) The seeker is in a relationship and wants to form a relationship with a female companion. The supporter should ask the seeker to let go of the fear of being cheated on by a female companion.	labels:I am glad you were able to confide a little in me and hope it is the first step on the road to a happier marriage. I do recommend not giving into your urges and remembering how much you love your wife. I wish you all the best for the future and have a lovely Christmas!.
text:Thanks, you too. The seeker learns that she is not a good wife. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to someone about how she is a good wife. The supporter could also talk with her husband about her sex addiction.	labels:(you need to end the conversation from your end - I can't ).	episode_done:True
text:Hello!\nHello. The seeker did greeting. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is doing a good job from the conversation.	labels:How are you today?

text:Yes, I am not sure who to tell. The seeker does not know who to tell, but the supporter could suggest telling someone or start a discussion about it with the seeker.	labels:Well as a neutral individual i would be willing to listen to your concerns and or stressors. It can help to be able to vent to someone without judgement.
text:Ok thank you. I have a lot of homework and housework, and especially during these difficult times it is hard to get support and feel like I am improving in life. It is really stressful and hard to plan out all the things I have to do, and sometimes I get a headache just thinking of it all. The seeker has anxiety and stress about the housework but is not sure who to tell. The supporter could tell the seeker to seek professional help. The supporter could also suggest that she or he is not sure who to tell.	labels:I see, it must feel like a lot of pressure to get so much done during an already hectic season..
text:Yes, and not being able to meet friends or go out much makes it hard to get all my emotions out. The seeker feels stressed and anxious about getting everything done. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to ask for help or support to help her with her homework and housework.	labels:Well first off that is normal to feel that way. I think most of us do but just don't speak up about it. Also being away from your friends and family can cause feelings of doubt because you may not feel like you have trusted ones to lean on.However. You should try to take some time out of each day to instead of question yourself to congratulate yourself, because you are doing tough things on your own but hey youre DOING IT!.
text:Do you have any tips on how to deal with headaches or being overly stressed or anxious? The seeker feels anxious and stressed about being stressed but she does not know what to do about it. The supporter should tell the seeker about helpful tips.	labels:For anxiety and stress i would sugesst taking time out away from all your chores and tasks and just be to yourself. What is something you enjoy? May a cup of tea or an episode of the office. You always have to take a moment for yourself.
text:So something like going for a run, or watching a funny movie? The seeker feels unwell and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to take time away from housework and housework stress. The supporter could also tell the seeker to have a friend or family member meet them.	labels:Meditation, yoga, a warm bath these things can also be soothing as well. SOmetimes using kinectic energy up can help as well like going for a brisk walk to burn off the adrenaline that causes anxiety.
text:Thank you for the ideas. But what if you get so stressed you can't really think of anything else? The seeker feels stressed because she is unable to think of anything else. The supporter should talk about ways to get more ideas or support.	labels:Yes! Heck go all out and do both is you have a treadmill ha ha ! do what makes YOU happy even if just for a moment. IF your stress has become that high, then you go ahead and aknowledge the anxiety that is flowing through you. Give it you attention and close your eyes and start to ask yourself what is the root of what is scaring me. What is the official thoing i am afrad of or worried about. When our thoughts begin to race its hard to focus and we make mistakes and that adds to the stress..
text:Thank you so much, your advice will be really helpful! The seeker has concerns over anxiety, but the supporter could also offer a deep breath and practice relaxation. The supporter could also offer to place the seeker in a standing position and get her to look at her feet.	labels:Would you like any links to a webpage or group that may also have tips or advice?
text:I think it is fine, but thank you so much for giving me tips. The seeker is helped because of the support. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are not alone and that other members of the audience can guide them.	labels:Youre very welcome! I hope that you are able to enjoy the rest of your holiday.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you.\nNot doing well.  I cant believe my girlfriend dump me for someone else. The seeker feels anxious because of the impending news.

text:we were together for 2 years.  It was such a surprise when she sprung this on me. The seeker feels not doing well because he has been with girlfriend for two years. I would suggest that the seeker try to find a reputable therapist to help him in this situation.	labels:Wow, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?

The supporter could suggest setting up a study group to help with that. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker goes to therapy if they feel like they are stuck with their social situation.	labels:I understand, I was with my wife for 4 years before she up and left without saying a word. That can be a hard thing to go through especially this time of year.

text:I do have friends, who are also friends with her. However they have families and do not visit prople because of covid. I don't have any true hobbies. I don't think they will fill the void anyways. The seeker feels lonely, but is not sure if she will find any friends or will be able to meditate. The supporter needs to ask about the hobbies.	labels:Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a get out of jail free card and explore other options.	labels:I'm actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it?

The supporter could tell the seeker to not run after the conversation. After the conversation, the seeker could think about ways to help herself.	labels:I do know how a programming job can take away from some social aspects of your life, maybe try and go to a bar, or somewhere social to get out some. No problem, I hope I have helped you some. Happy Holidays!

The supporter could also show the seeker how to get a job.	labels:It's important that you know that you can feel whatever way you need to about your loss. Its a tough time of year for something like that. Had things been pretty rocky?
text:Things like this were sudden.  I mean, I never expected her to up and walk out with the kids. The only thing I can think of was that California was getting too expensive and the homeless were taking over LA; that may have spooked her to leave the state. The seeker feels uncomfortable because it is unexpected. The supporter can thank the seeker for not being surprised.	labels:Wow, that's horrible. It seems you should have some kind of legal authority in that aspect. Is that a big problem out there?
text:I really don't have any discourse.  The kids are almost 18.  They are twins. Yeah, in her eyes, she seems fed up with the state. She left me for Texas, the state, not the person. I mean, she never mentioned loving, "Text," but the kids are bing into the Dallas Cowboys. The seeker is not being honest with the supporter. The supporter should ask the seeker once she is happy and confident in her job situation. The supporter could ask the seeker to find a support group, like a counseling group.	labels:It is important that you understand that it seems that she has been thinking of this for a while..
text:I overhead her say that Texas is a free state and my twin boys do love the Dallas Cowboy's team. The seeker has the impression that the state is not a big family and that she needs to leave.

text:Well, she left two days ago.  I came home and the furniture and my widescreen TV were all gone. We lived in a small apartment in LA. The seeker is in shock because she thought that the twin boys love the Cowboys. The supporter could advise the seeker to talk to friends and family in Laredo.	labels:That's mid-boggling..
text:I am D-I-S-G-U-S-T-E-D to the Nth degree. The seeker feels that she has been thinking of Texas since last November. The supporter could suggest that the seeker spend some time in Texas in the future to remember the things that she is thankful for.	labels:Do you have any hobbies?

text:Oh, that may just help me relax and think about other things besides my wifey and twin kiddos. Well, your input has helped. The seeker feels stressed because she is feeling disconnected from her husband. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a massage.	labels:I have found for me anyway, that running is an amazing stress reliever.	episode_done:True
text:I still see him from time to time online, but I don't know why he just dropped me. The seeker feels guilty about not finding him on the internet. The supporter could say that maybe he dropped her because she doesn't want to see him. The supporter could also ask the seeker to post a status update on twitter (this will help the supporter to get the seeker to a better place).	labels:Who do you see online? What did he drop on you?
text:I occasionally see the guy that I was dating online, and it makes me feel sad all over again. He dropped our relationship.. The seeker feels sad because of the drop. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share the experience. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:Can you block notifications for him? How long ago did he stop it?
text:I thought seriously about that, but for some stupid reason, I keep thinking, "What if he comes to his senses and wants to contact me?" A couple months ago, but I haven't gotten over him. The seeker feels sad because he misses being with the guy he was dating. The supporter could tell the seeker that he could start some dating sites.	labels:If you block him and he wants to get in touch, he will find a way.  Make him work hard.
text:You really think playing hard to get will work? The seeker feels like she is playing hard to get because she is seeing the guy she was dating online.

text:With him... he was perfect (or at least I thought), but also, I'm lonely, and it's hard to process not being in a relationship during the pandemic. The seeker feels lonely, but is not sure if he is in the relationship or not. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her friends about not being in the relationship.	labels:Have you tried making other connections online? A lot of people are home during this pandemic, you may meet someone much better.
text:True. What can I do to get over him in the meantime? The seeker feels lonely and sad. He is thinking about his male friend, but his friend is not there. The supporter could suggest that the seeker look for a female friend to meet.	labels:Keep busy! Get mad instead of sad!. I would not contact him if he was not contacting me.  You deserve better than that!
text:Lol. I think I can do that! The seeker has a sense of worry about her boyfriend. The supporter can suggest that the seeker should go to a psychologist.	labels:Yes, we women function better when we get pissed!
text:You're right. What do I do if he contacts me again? Do I let the conversation play out and see what happens? The seeker feels lonely and worries about being in a relationship. The supporter can tell the seeker to do a lot of research on the internet, find others who are in a relationship and talk to them about the issues. The supporter could also ask the seeker about her own life and how she is dealing with the situation. The supporter could encourage the seeker to do the same.	labels:Play it cool and be ready to make up a whole bunch of fun things you have been doing. .
text:That's a good idea. I can do that. The seeker feels lonely and is looking for a friend. The supporter should ask the seeker to find other friends and get in touch with them.	labels:Of course you can!. You may find your feelings have changed.  Sometimes we just want what we don't have, lol.

Thanks for your sharing and sorry to hear about that.
text:Ty. Death is so hard. How would you deal? The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up and time schedule or to get more motivation.	labels:I felt the same way as you when your closed family members pass away. I would share my feeling with someone that I felt closed or some family members or your spouse that you can share your feeling. Do you try to talk to anyone about your feeling? Or someone that close to you that you can share your feeling with?
text:My husband is here. He is very afraid of the virus because of his COPD.  He i afraid to talk about the virus. I just moved to this town where there are not so many people because of thi.

The supporter could tell the seeker it is a great job for her.	labels:Sometimes that will help to get a better perspective on things... taking some time away from everything in order to catch a breath.
text:Maybe I can spend some quality time with my kids without them knowing I will be out of a job as of 01/15/2021. It is almost Christmas, too. The seeker is very stressed about losing her job. The supporter could talk about the importance of treating your job like a second home.	labels:I hear ya, I feel like that quite a bit. Like if isn't one thing it's another. I'm sure your wife will understand how the economy has gotten and that she knows that it isn't your fault.
text:Maybe, but we have a huge mortgage and two BMW's. We spend lavishly.... Plus, I spend 50 dollars a day on lotto. The seeker feels like a consumer. The supporter could suggest the seeker to spend some time with the children and make sure they are happy. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get more education.	labels:Sometimes it's hard to see the other door opening when we run into tough times, but remember all the good times you have had. Those would not be good times if it were'nt for tough times..
text:True, but the Office was my home away from home.  I need to figure out how to deal with my sadness..... The seeker feels sad about being lost in the office. The supporter could tell the seeker that the unemployment rate is dropping. It is also important to remember the unemployment rate can be falling.	labels:Well try and think of maybe only spending half of that on lottery, maybe that will help to conserve some money in these tough times. Do you have any hobbies?
text:Yeah, that is a good point.  Should I change careers? I like to walk and do pushups on a regular basis; does that count?? The seeker is sad that she lost her job. The supporter should ask the seeker about her hobbies, and the reason for this sadness.	labels:I don't think a huge change like that is neccessary, maybe just looking into options. Unemployment and government help until something else comes up. That is an excellent way to help relieve some stress from our daily lives.
text:Unemployment doesn't last forever; plus, I have pride in my work.  Americans are suppose to be strong. The seeker feels like she is a weak person and can't handle the unemployment. The supporter could suggest that she should have a discussion with her friends and family about her future.	labels:Exercise also  releases endorphins that can make you feel happy.
text:Any other suggestions? I was thinking about becoming an Uber and Lyft driver. The happiness wears off, however. The seeker is stressed from her job situation. The supporter could suggest that the seeker try to spend part of her day with her family. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker do yoga.	labels:I like to hear that, I am a proud American myself..
text:Well, thanks for your input.  I think this chat has been helpful.  I am a proud American! Good bye. The seeker feels hopeful, hopeful that the supporter will help her find better opportunities. The supporter could continue to discuss what she is doing and how they are going to help her.	labels:It does wear off, but if you get into a routine of doing it, it will help to alleviate some of that sadness. Ok thank you I hope things get going in the right direction for you. Merry Christmas!	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nI'm really upset about a break up I just had with my boyfriend. The seeker did feeling upset. The supporter should tell the seeker to move on and has no problems with the break ups.	labels:I am sorry, when did this happen?
text:It happened two days ago.  I can't believe he led me on for almost a year knowing that I had two children and all of a sudden decided that he didn't want to deal with kids. The seeker feels upset after the break up. The supporter could tell the seeker that the break up was not a big deal and said that she was sorry that it happened. 	labels:I can understand the pain you must feel and the betrayal, that is absolutely awful.
text:I do.  I don't understand why he was fine with my kids for almost a  year and all of a sudden it changed.  I'm completely blindsided. The seeker feels betrayed by her boyfriend because he chose not to talk about the kids. The supporter could say that she was hurt by the breakup and accuse her boyfriend of not saying the kids were important.	labels:How are your children doing through this?
text:They don't know yet.  I didn't want to upset them right before Christmas. The seeker feels that she is being hurt by the decision to let her children go. The supporter will help the seeker to understand that she did not have to be that way. She was hurt, but that did not mean she was wrong.	labels:What a terrible thing for him to do. I agree with you not to upset them right before Christmas.
text:I'm not really sure how to break it to them when I do finally tell them. The seeker felt upset because she was unsure how to tell them. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try to do something to make them happy, like giving them a special present or giving them a gift. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to plan a trip for them, like going to Disneyland or going to a concert.	labels:That is always a tough one. My suggestion is to not put him in a bad light since they do not have the angry feelings toward him that you do. Maybe tell them that he has made some choices in life that doesn't involve you, and unfortunately, we cannot control people and their feelings.
text:That is a good idea.  That would be good so they don't think it has anything to do with them because I'd never want them to feel bad about it! The seeker has told the supporter that the break up is not her fault and that she does not blame him. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not a bad person, but it is still too soon to tell him what to do. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she could tell him that he should stop living by his own rules and to live by his heart instead.	labels:Exactly, that is a burden that children should never have to endure. They are always the innocent victims in our personal problems.
text:Hopefully they don't ask me what choices he made and want details. The seeker felt overwhelmed by feeling deceived by her boyfriend. The supporter should ask the seeker to tell her what her boyfriend did.	labels:True! How old are they?
text:They are 6 and 8 years old. The seeker feels guilty about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could ask the seeker to tell the children about how she was feeling.	labels:They should hopefully be young enough not to want details. Maybe if they ask say he didn't give you details because he apparently doesn't know himself what he wants. You sound like a very caring mother who wants the very best for her children.
text:thank you! Knowing someone thinks I'm a good mother makes me feel a little better about the situation! The seeker feels relieved that her boyfriend is not a bad person. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has made some mistakes, but has come back with the promise that he would make good. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the family will never be without her and will have her back.	labels:I have a daughter and we have went through something similar in the past so I can relate. The truth is, I have found over time that it is our children who get us through these tough time.
text:Yes, seeing their faces tomorrow when they open presents will help get me through this sad time! The seeker has been upset because her boyfriend broke up with her. The supporter could remind the seeker that you are a good mother and prevent her from feeling bad. The supporter could also suggest questions to ask the seeker to clarify whether or not she is being mean to him.	labels:You will get through this and come out ahead in the long run, just stay strong!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker said Hello. The supporter could say hello to the seeker.	labels:Hello there, how are you?
text:Kind of angry and disappointed. The seeker did not like the supporter. The supporter should come up with some kind of suggestions that the seeker could use to improve the supporter's attitude towards the seeker. In this conversation, the seeker could just tell the supporter that she is not happy.	labels:I'm very sorry to hear that, did something not go as planned recently?
text:My friend created a group chat for planning activities and did not include me. She included people who are closer to me than to her. Almost like she is trying to steal my friends. The seeker feels disappointed and thinks that because of her friend she is not included in the group chat. When the supporter sees that the seeker is not included, the supporter should tell the seeker that there is a reason for that.	labels:I see. So when she did this, it gave you the feeling of almost being replaced or abandoned by your own social circle?
text:In a way. I was disappointed by the rest of them but mostly angry at her. It almost feels like she wants to be the leader of the group and feels like I am her competition. The seeker did not feel abandoned. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a new group and talk to these other people. The supporter could also ask her if she has any concerns about the group.	labels:It's definitely frustrating to feel that your support system could possibly become a source of stress and competition anxiety. Especially since it's where we're supposed to feel safe and unjudged.
text:Exactly. They are supposed to be the people I can go to with my problems. Now I feel like they all had a secret which I wasn't privy to and it made me feel disconnected and untrusting towards them. The seeker feels frustrated by the support system because they are not the source of his or her stress. The supporter could offer the seeker questions to help him or her to be more aware of the support system.	labels:It sounds that you're a person who really does care about keeping the relationships they've invested in healthy and open. That care level can definitely cause natural anxiousness in situations like this, when the place you stand with them and what they're thinking suddenly feels uncertain.
text:I am a bit of an idealist. I like for everyone to be in harmony, to be nice, supportive, caring, open and honest. I don't know how to move on from this. The seeker feels anxious and uncertain about her relationship with the supporters. The supporter could help the seeker to feel happy about herself and confident about her relationships. The supporter could also ask the seeker to do more research about her relationships.	labels:Right, and there are endless possibilites the mind can create outside of ideal. But funnily enough, the imagination of an idealist that lets them visualize great things can also create equally strong fears before getting answers. And thankfully those fears can be addressed outside of the head where they're made. Have you tried reaching out to these friends  yourself and initiating your own plan with them since this group chat?
text:I talked about it with one friend. He felt bad but what I couldn't understand why he was secretive about the chat too. If he thought we were close why hide stuff? The seeker feels anxious about the group chat and fears becoming part of this group. The supporter could ask the seeker to try to get rid of the worries and get more goals to work towards.	labels:Right, it can seem a bit confusing since you naturally would expect to feel comfortable with so much between each other already.
text:Do you think it is asking too much on my part? The seeker feels insecure and insecure when she feels close with the other people in the group. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her friends and ask them to come to the group chat.	labels:On the contrary, I think you might not be allowing yourself to ask enough! Sometimes, the people who are closest to us can actually become even more anxious about how something might affect your feelings. It could be the case with him too.
text:Sometimes I question if it is even worth talking to them about it. People often don't want to say what they really think. Instead they just say whatever to avoid confrontation.. The seeker feels anxious about everything. The supporter would encourage the seeker to think about what he/she wants to say. The supporter could suggest that the seeker look into the past experiences of her/his friends. It could be the case that the seeker could have a relationship with a friend who has experienced similar situations and have not been able to wait until a certain time to speak to them.	labels:Some people express themselves best through their actions. Have you tried suggesting a meeting for something you'd usually do to see if they're willing to hang out just as always?	episode_done:True
text:Hello! I am here to listen! How are you feeling? Hello! I am here to listen! How are you feeling? *you.\nI'm very stressed.  Virtual school is so hard. I've never gotten bad grades before this year. The seeker talks about stress. The supporter should be supportive and try to get her to talk about that.	labels:So you are having trouble with Virtual school being so hard and it's causing you stress, am I understanding correctly?
text:Yes, that is correct.  I need to be in a classroom to really grasp the material, I think. The seeker feels stress because of the stress of school. The supporter could tell the seeker about taking a class in a virtual school. The supporter could also tell the seeker that her parents can help her with that.	labels:I remember being in your position. I know it's very hard and I am so sorry that you are stressed.
text:I just want to quit school because I can't seem to do better. The seeker feels stressed about quitting school. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do a study group to get motivated.	labels:I know you said you want to quit, but hang in there!.
text:I wish I knew how long we would have to be virtual.  I don't think I can last another semester teaching myself from home. The seeker feels stressed because of being a virtual teacher. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is a great idea to go back and get some motivation. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to a teacher and ask for help with their lessons.	labels:It sounds like you have always done well with school, this virus has made it to where so many people are struggling. Just chatting with you, I can feel how stressed and anxious about it you are!
text:Yes, I was always an honors student so this is a huge change for me.   I'm afraid it will reflect on my GPA forever. The seeker feels anxious about the virtual school. The supporter should ask the seeker to rethink the school and what the school is all about.	labels:I know that the situation with virtual learning is out of your control when it comes to how long it will last but is there anything you could do to relieve your stress while you are trying to learn things yourself?
text:I tried exercise to see if that would help.  It hasn't really helped because the time I spend exercising I just think I could be studying. The seeker 's stress is caused by time spent exerting to learn. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do some different activities to relieve her stress.	labels:When you start feeling stressed maybe you could try deep breathing for a few minutes to relax again. Or take a quick break and get some fresh air? Is there anything else that you do in any other situation that would normally help you relax?
text:I could try deep breathing. Fresh air is hard because we're in the middle of a snow storm! I like to go to a spa when I'm really stressed. The seeker feels stressed because of the snow. The supporter could suggest the seeker to switch it up by going to a spa.	labels:Oh wow that would make things complicated! But yes the deep breathing would definitely help, I'm sure!
text:I will try the deep breathing more often. . The seeker is stressed because of the problems with virtual school and it is making her anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker to listen to listening skills and practice listening.	labels:Maybe you could reward yourself with a spa trip ever so often, since you enjoy it?.
text:That's a good idea.  Maybe I could make it a reward for a good grade on a test. The seeker is stressed about the stress of Virtual school, but there is nothing to reward her with. The supporter could ask her to take a break from meditation and exercise.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!
text:I think it might too! The seeker feels stressed because of Virtual school. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to a spa and get some natural relief. The supporter could also ask the seeker to print out a list of places to go and try to go a couple times a year.	labels:Yes, please do! I am almost certain that could help you!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Feeling low today. The seeker feels low because her feelings are related to the financial situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her family and work colleagues to get an emotional support system.	labels:Thank you for reaching out. Tell me more about it..
text:I've been remote working for the entire pandemic. At first, it was great. I didn't go into the office very often before, so I felt relief from feeling any obligation to do so. But now I wonder if I am presenting myself well if my clients and coworkers have so much less personal interaction. The seeker feels low after being remote working for the pandemic. The supporter could explain the reasons the seeker feels low. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to have more personal time with the clients and coworkers.	labels:yeah I agree. This pandemic has really been weighing on us. As it pertains to work, you feel like the lacking of personal interaction has distanced yourself and colleagues and you feel like there is an increasingly large barrier given the physical constraint?.
text:Yes. I can be terse and maybe even come across as confrontational online. But when I interact in person, we share so more - body language, facial expressions, we don't have as much of a time constraint. I feel like a lot of my value may be overshadowed by unfavorable impressions. The seeker feels lonely because the supporter is not sure if she is showing up well. The supporter could suggest that the seeker go to the doctor or go to the gym to see if she is in need of a physical therapist.	labels:Can you tell me more about your work responsibilities - is it of a customer service nature? It would help me understand your situation better. I can relate to words vs. the combination of facial expression, body language, etc. The single channel of communication has stripped a lot of meaning and value and has made performance a lot more difficult. The transition is challenging and the uncertainty of the future also adds to the stress.
text:Yes, it is of customer service nature. I provide expertise and technical products. I often advise others who do not have the same level of knowledge. I have to convey ideas that may seem quite abstract. Challenging face-to-face, and I have fewer online tools to help share knowledge in a meaningful way. The seeker feels stressed and has to convey ideas from her personal experience. The supporter should encourage the seeker to share more about her experience.	labels:Thank you for sharing that. I have a better understanding now.What you feel is very valid, and I am sure it is shared among a lot of people this year.. I am somewhat familiar with technical leadership. It requires a lot of mentoring and a level of comprehension of what others are doing..
text:Thanks. It helps to know that I'm not alone. Most often, I work independently my work. Involves a lot of explaining and justification. Before we just all sat in the same room and worked together. The seeker feels anxious about her work. The supporter can tell the seeker that she is not alone and that there are many people in the world who have similar struggles. The supporter could ask for more information about her work.	labels:My current work is in the finance section. Prior to pandemic, the touch base with colleagues are rather pleasant. Now the workload has decreased and we are rigidly arranging for meetings in 30 minute time slots. It is challenging in a sense that it is harder to fill the gap.. yeah it is a classroom for us to learn to adapt to the new normal. I understand the removal of everyone being the same room and chat tools don't convey the meaning 100 percent..
text:So, perhaps limiting meeting times can help the team focus on issues? The seeker feels stressed about the responsibilities to be specific. The supporter could help the seeker to self-evaluate her work responsibilities.	labels:I would personally suggest more happy hours, in case you haven't already done so.
text:Ah, something more casual? The seeker feels relaxed and does not feel anxious about meeting in a time constraint. The supporter could explain that the seeker is not fully applying for the job, but is still focused on career goals. The supporter could also say that people will not be able to do everything in a single day.	labels:Holiday care packages would also be a good common ground for folks to gather around over something that is not work.
text:That's a great idea! I would love to get a care package, actually! The seeker feels a holiday care package is a good place to go to with friends and family. The supporter could tell the seeker that the planning can be productive and comfortable at the same time.	labels:Yeah maybe also virtual meditation sessions can help concentration mind and body. It doesn't have to be hobbies of our own, but doing it as a team virtually can bring people together and boost morale..
text:Thank you! I will suggest that my organization arrange these. We can even ask all the employees to showcase their hobbies, or some such. I will pass these suggestions on! Have a great holiday season! The seeker hopes to get a care package. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a care package or to take a class to learn how to become more efficient and effective at caring for the sick. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get a yoga class or a meditation class.	labels:That is good to hear. I am aware that the other team in my company all read a book called How to Be Antiracist. It can serve as both learning and bonding purposes.. I am glad that I can be of help. Thank you again for reaching out. Hope you adjust better to the changing norm next year and happy holidays..	episode_done:True
text:I need support to feel ok during the pandemic. The seeker was worried about the pandemic and was anxious about the possibility of getting sick. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her friends about what to do.	labels:Hello.
text:HI there. The seeker feels ok, but the supporter fails to understand why. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the pandemic is still going on. The supporter could also say the pandemic is the cause for the seeker to feel ok.	labels:What type of things are you worried about during the pandemic?
text:That I may not find a job soon which is making me depressed. The seeker has been feeling depressed and anxious about her job situation. I would encourage the supporter to ask to find a job. The supporter could ask for a couple of small things to help her.	labels:So just to make sure I understand, you are anxious about possibly loosing your job due to the pandemic.
text:I am not working at the moment, I am looking for a job but it has been really difficult to find one. The seeker talks about job situation, where she has a job, but she is worried about future job. The supporter could answer that the seeker is blaming the job situation for her anxiety, instead of the pandemic.	labels:Have you looked into a hiring agency? They are great at helping find people jobs, especially in these hard times.
text:I have but seems like there are no entry level jobs currently and also some employers have ceased hiring. The seeker is worried about not finding a job, but there is a friend. The supporter should encourage the seeker to ask her friend if there are job openings.	labels:After interviews have you been following up to show interest again in the job?
text:Yes I have emailed every employer where I was interviewed. Also I follow up with every hiring agency I have signed up to. The seeker feels insecure about the possibility of not finding a job. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should take an opportunity to apply for a job.	labels:Have you networked with any previous co-workers? They might be able to help you find something as well,
text:They all suggest to wait for a few months till things are bit normal. They also advice to keep trying. The seeker feels stressed about job situation because of the uncertainty. The supporter could provide some guidance for the seeker.	labels:Just from chatting with you for a few I can tell this is making you very anxious/
text:Yes it indeed is. The seeker does not like hiring company, so the supporter could suggest networking. The supporter should also suggest that the seeker talk to her friends about hiring companies.	labels:I have also been worried recently about finding another job because of the pandemic, but I found that getting back into my hobbies has helped keep me distracted and get my mind off of it.
text:It is very difficult to stay home doing nothing, it is very upsetting. I have started to paint which I have always enjoyed doing but again when I see others close me work and settled it makes me feel sad that I don't have a job. The seeker feels sad about not having a job because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to think about how she would feel if she had a job and could help her by doing something in her life.	labels:I think painting more would be very helpful!
text:I should try doing that, thanks. The seeker worries about finding a job, but does nothing to mention. The supporter would take this one step further. The supporter could suggest the seeker to keep the painting in the background and if he/she meets his/her work expectations, the supporter would tell the seeker to persevere and hope for a job.	labels:No problem! If you have any other issues just chat in!
text:No issues other than this at the moment. Have you found a new job? The seeker is worried about finding a new job. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get a job.	labels:I have! I went through hiring agencies and got one. It did take a while, but it was super helpful.
text:Glad to hear, Congratulations!! Hope I find a job soon. The seeker has found a new job. The supporter should ask the seeker to send her resume to the hiring agent to see if that region is open.	labels:I know you will find something soon!
text:Thanks!! The seeker is happy with the hiring agency and is relieved to hear a good job. The supporter should tell the seeker that they have found a job and that they can expect it soon.	labels:You're welcome!	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker felt shy, but the reason is not given. The supporter should ask the seeker what is wrong with her.	labels:hell, sorry. How are you today?
text:A little down. Kind of broke for Christmas. The seeker feels broken because of the Christmas. The supporter can suggest that the seeker try to do something to motivate herself. The supporter could also suggest to focus on reading and doing anything that makes the seeker feel happy.	labels:I totally understand how you feel.
text:Yeah, it's pretty tough because the year went really well until the summer. I was hoping for a strong close. The seeker feels a little down because of the Christmas. The supporter could tell the seeker to make this a very special day.	labels:If you don't mind may I ask you a few question? Are you trying to find gigs?
text:Yes but with the pandemic, people are just doing small work themselves instead of hiring out. The seeker seems frustrated that she is struggling to find gigs. The supporter should ask the seeker to join a band or other musician group to try to find gigs.	labels:Sorry. I guess you have to change your plan so much..
text:That's what I've been doing, but it's a lot of running in place trying to generate any income. The seeker feels like she is at a loss with what to do. The supporter could help her with the next steps of her research. The supporter could also suggest that she could sell her photography business and have a hard time finding work.	labels:I meant you had to change your plan.
text:Yes, and the changes I've made to the plan haven't lead to a whole lot more. One of those "painted myself into a corner" situations. The seeker feels uncomfortable about the exam and wants to stop the stress. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should try to focus on her skills and her passions.	labels:I am also looking for more gigs and because of Covid, I'm only looking online jobs.
text:Like "work from home" style jobs? The seeker did not mention the job, but the spokesperson could tell the seeker she is looking for work, but not a full time job. It should be obvious to the supporter that the seeker has a job.	labels:yes just like this mturk.
text:Hmm, maybe I can look into these type of jobs. I don't have a great computer but it could do for some stuff. The seeker is trying to find work from home jobs. The supporter could suggest that she should consider a good health food startup or tech company. The supporter could also ask the seeker to look into the health food startup.	labels:Jobs are super competitive these days. Have you thought about becoming a YouTuber or a live streamer?
text:Yes, I've tried both of those. It's mostly luck based. You just have to hope that enough people get interested to make it work and a lot of wasted effort goes into self-promotion. The seeker feels that she has to change her plan because of the uncertainty of what will happen to her career. The supporter could remind the seeker that self-promotion is not the answer.	labels:I believe after Covid is over more onsite jobs will be available. I hope you will be able to comfortably spend your days until then.
text:I agree with that. I just hope. * I can make it until then. The seeker feels stressed, but is given no specific reason why she should be stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker if there is an occupation that she would like to pursue. The supporter could also ask the seeker what kind of job she would like to pursue.	labels:Oh I see. I see you have made a lot of effort to get additional income. Wonderful, I believe you are a great worker when you work, whatever you do. You have passion and motivation..
text:That is true, I am a hard worker, no matter the job. The seeker is impressed with the supporter's support. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has the right work ethic and passion and the right amount of work ethic and passion.	labels:I would brush up my resume, make it more noticeable, change your LinkedIn profile if you have one. So that future employer will be able to find you, such a great candidate..
text:Hmmm, my resume could use some work, that is true. The seeker is in a tight situation. She needs more income, but is not sure what to do. The supporter could tell the seeker to ask friends, family or family to give her some extra help. The supporter may ask the seeker to get more help in the future.	labels:About resume, one of my friends added his picture wearing a Trump tie on his resume  lol . I thought it was weird but whatever it makes it noticeable could help. Or you could start your own business as you have already tried as a YouTuber. I heard a lot of people starts their own because of Covid.
text:I never thought about adding a picture to my resume, but it would help show that I'm a professional. I have ran my own business, doing custom woodworking for people. For now, I'd rather work for other people. Plus the whole being broke thing really restricts what I could do for a new business. The seeker feels that she is not able to find a job. The supporter should ask the seeker to go to a student internship so that the seeker can find a job.	labels:Me either, I had never seen a resume with a picture. Yes wear a nice suit and look good..
text:I will try that. The seeker feels alone and has no faith of success. The supporter could suggest that the seeker looks at her resume and looks at what she does have. The supporter can tell the seeker that her resume and the work she has done is not enough to succeed.	labels:Oh I see. Woodworking sounds cool! I would do the same and start my own business as a side at first.. It makes me want to lift my dumbells and get some muscles!!
text:Well I think I'm going to go work on my resume and maybe buy some new tools. The seeker was thinking about how to get new muscles. The supporter should also look for more jobs, since there are a lot of people who are currently in a job for money.	labels:I hope you'll find something perfect soon and enjoy your quiet Chrismas.
text:Yes, thank you for the ideas. Goodbye. The seeker feels alone and stressed. The supporter would be looking for examples of how to relax and just be a good husband and father.	labels:ok it was great talking to you. Good luck. Bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hey, how are you doing? The seeker felt a little bit of nervousness, but the supporter should comfort her by telling her that she is doing great. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing great and that she should stay positive.	labels:Hello, I am doing well. How are you doing today?
text:I'm doing alright, I'm facing a lot of academic pressure from my program and I feel trapped. The seeker feels trapped because she is faced with a lot of pressure. The supporter could tell the seeker to set a goal for herself on how to cope with that pressure.	labels:Oh, it sounds like you are stressed from the academic pressure that you are facing right now?
text:Yes, I have a lot of coursework but I have no help from from my advisors. A few of my peers feel the same way. Not sure what to do. I don't believe remote learning is helpful in a master program because the professor/advisor are not always available.. The seeker feels a need to get help from those around her. The supporter should encourage the seeker to come to the support group.	labels:I see how this can be stressful for you and your fellow peers. Have you tried other steps besides the one's you tried before by contacting the professor?

I was in a similar position not too long ago. I had a hard time wrapping my head around how fast my ex could move on from what we had. How does it make you feel that he's trying to start a new relationship so soon after yours?
text:It makes me feel like he didn't learn anything from our relationship or like he thinks he's better than me because he has someone new and I don't. I'm trying to take some time and be alone and be okay with being alone, which is good I think, but sometimes I feel really really lonely too. Like maybe I won't ever find anyone.. The seeker feels lonely and anxious about her ex-husband. The supporter could say that the seeker is unhappy and confused about her life. The supporter could also say that the seeker is struggling with the ex-husband and the changes they are making. The supporter could also ask the seeker to write down what they are struggling with.	labels:That must feel really isolating. But working on yourself and becoming a better you is the only way to move on in a healthy manner. I think you're doing the right thing in waiting and learning to love yourself before you can open up and love another..
text:Thank you! Exactly. But it is scary. I am guessing from your name that you identify as male (please forgive me if that is incorrect), so you might not understand what it feels like to be an older woman when your ex starts dating someone a lot younger. Men only get better and more desirable with age, not so for women.. The seeker feels lonely because she thinks she won't find someone new. If the seeker is male and the supporter is female, the supporter could ask the seeker to find a male friend or a male therapy.	labels:I might not understand that particular aspect, but self worth is still self worth no matter the context. I'd say try not to pay any mind to what he's up to. The grass always looks greener on the other side of the fence, but if you just focus on watering your grass (making yourself happy) then you'll have a much more fulfilling life..
text:Haha, watering my own grass. That is a good way to put it. Thank you for talking to me for a few minutes. It makes me feel a little bit better to have someone agree that it is okay to spend time working on me, instead of thinking that it is sad or pathetic or an excuse. I really appreciate it.. The seeker is happy to have someone recognize that she is worth more than she is. The supporter could also mention that she is worth more than is due to her age.	labels:Oh absolutely Keri. Thanks for opening up and sharing your experience and feelings with me for just a few minutes. It was great to talk to you..
text:Have a good night, Jonathan. :-). The seeker feels better to have the supporter disagree with her. The supporter is sorry that she is feeling bad about being alone. She should tell the seeker that she will always be there for her. The seeker could also tell the supporter that she is going through some difficulties.	labels:Happy Holidays Keri. Keep your head up!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how is this season treating you?.\nIt's alright. Definitely not as cold as last year which is something to be slightly thankful for. The seeker is grateful for the warm weather.

The supporter could suggest she be willing to discuss methods of stress management.	labels:Ah I am sorry to hear that. Please try not to worry too much as it's a common worry to have. Do you want to tell me the details?.
text:Sure. One of my classes is extremely difficult and the professor has not been responsive at all. The TA is kind enough to make time to help me with homework, but my grades are still not great. It makes me feel really dumb and undeserving to be in that class. The seeker had a feeling of being in unappreciated position.	labels:So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely?.
text:I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this  class in particular.. I'm afraid of failing, but I'm not sure if that should be a concern either. Over the past 3 years, no one has gotten a grade lower than a B.. The seeker feels uncertain about her class because of her fear about failing. The supporter could remind her that she is not alone. She can also tell her that her grades are great and she is a good student.	labels:But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard? Do you think that maybe most of your classmates are secretly feeling the same?.
text:Sometimes I think about that. At the same time, I feel like it's unfair to compare myself to others.. The seeker thinks about her situation and it is fair to compare. The supporter should help the seeker and ask her what she wants to do with her life.	labels:This sounds like it might be a self esteem issue and not about your grades. I have felt this sort of thing myself and I do know how awful it is to be so hard on yourself..
text:So what do I do about it? I don't want to keep feeling like this. The seeker feels like she should decide what she wants to do about her grades. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a study group, or discuss with her friends about what she would do about it.	labels:Have you thought about seeing a therapist? Does your school have any free therapy programmes you could use?.
text:I don't think my school has free therapy programs. I have thought about seeing a therapist but I've heard therapy is very expensive.With student loans, I didn't really put much more research into therapy past hearing about the costs. The seeker is worried that her school is not providing any free therapy. The supporter could suggest the seeker to attend an alternative therapy.	labels:A far as I am aware there are charitable organisations which can arrange a few free therapy session for you. Perhaps you could talk to your doctor about it?. I have had free therapy sessions before and I found them very helpful.
text:I think free therapy sessions would be a good place to start. The seeker felt free to talk to her doctor. The supporter can also suggest free therapy to the seeker.	labels:It would help you work on your self confidence and you might find that you are not doing as badly in school as you think you are..

The seeker feels insecure about her school achievements, but the supporter could suggest that she focus on her grades and not her performance in exams. In this conversation, the seeker feels insecure about her performance in exams. The supporter could suggest that she focus on her grades and not her performance in exams.	labels:Then I think it is probably just a general self esteem issue and nothing academic!. Anyway it's been really nice to talk to you and I hope that everything goes your way.
text:I think talking about this has helped. I'll do a little more digging. Thank you! The seeker is not sure if she is in the right place. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask a friend to talk to her about this.	labels:You're most welcome, have a lovely Holiday season..	episode_done:True
text:Hi... The seeker seems uninterested. The supporter should ask the seeker to give something back to the supporter.	labels:hello how are. you.
text:not doing too hot tbh. The seeker is feeling hot. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could talk to friends or seek professional help. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker could look for a psychiatrist.	labels:what is the problem bud?
text:my girlfriend broke up with me. The seeker needs to set something in stone. The supporter could tell her that the issue is not the breakup, but the work situation. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she can work on finding a new job.	labels:fuck women all my homies hate women.
text:what's that supposed to mean. The seeker feels stressed, but there are no answers given. The supporter should try to clarify the issue to the seeker.	labels:don't worry about it just lighting the mood but really girls can be complicated and i get that its hard to understand why she left.
text:what do I do, we've been with each other for 4 and a half months. The seeker feels insecure about her current situation, but it is not mentioned. The supporter should encourage her to open up about the situation.	labels:just give some time for yourself hangout with your friends and be free.
text:i wish but I dedicated so much time for her, I was planning to hang out with her over Christmas and blew off my friends. now they have their own plans.

text:I was supposed to introduce her, now I just look like a loser. The seeker is worried about her girlfriend leaving and the supporter could suggest that she wait a few months to see if she can work things out. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to go to therapy.	labels:trust me family never thinks of you like that you'll always be great to them.
text:I guess you're right, should I try to get her back though. The seeker is confused by the supporter's advice. The supporter mentioned that there are plans for their family and that it would be nice if the seeker could get back with her girlfriend and friend.	labels:no man you don't need her she had her chance and you'll find the right one someday just hang in there.
text:but she was the one. The seeker feels like she has no chance to get her boyfriend back. The supporter could point out that she is not going to be able to get her boyfriend back because he is already in a relationship with someone else. The supporter could also point out that while she is not in a relationship with her boyfriend, she is in a relationship with someone else.	labels:if she was the one then she wouldn't have left you're better off without her give other girls a chance.
text:ive been smoking a lot more because of this incident, what else can I do to cope? and vaping. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned.

text:being with her man. The seeker asks the supporter to be friends with a girl she likes. The supporter could ask the seeker to go out with her friends before she decides to go out with the guy she is going to go out with.

The seeker feels stressed because she is hit by the pressure at school. The supporter can offer a stress relief pill or a pay raise.	labels:I can definetely imagine how stressful the last week of school can be, especially taking 5 courses instead of 4. However, don't let this situation scare you or ruin  your holidays. There are ways to cope with said stress.
text:Yeah.  I am glad you are here to help me think things through. I need to find a solution to my anxiety while I knock out paper after paper. The seeker does stress because of the stress. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a reading group.	labels:First of all, do you have some academic counselor you can talk to? Help you organize your ideas or classwork? Can you refer to professors or fellow classmates for help?
text:Well, counselors are hard to get ahold of so close to the Holidays.  The so-called teachers are not that helpful. seniors must figure it out by themselves.....(for the most part). My roommate is a lunatic.. The seeker has problems and stress. The supporter should encourage the seeker to find out what advice the counselor would give her.	labels:Are you confident in your abilities to succeed in those classes or you think you might lack the materials or knowledge? Or perhaps time?
text:I just don't know.  I am going to try my best to submit every assignment on time, even though the quality prolly won't be 100%. I am a perfectionist by nature. I am a bit moody and my roommates have noticed it. The seeker feels confident in her abilities to succeed, but she is uncertain about the materials or knowledge. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should find out other options. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should seek out a tutoring resource.	labels:It's okto be moody given the circumstances and the stress you are going through, and I think that you should attemp to complete all the assignments even if you don't get a 100% on them. That will show the professors that you are responsible and care about the subject or perhaps your major.
text:I think that I need to research more to ace this out. The seeker feels stressed and worried about completing all of the assignments. The supporter could tell the seeker that to be a perfectionist, you must be motivated.	labels:Accomplishing to submit everything will also make you feel good with yourself! It's important than you take your time.
text:Most so-called professors are snobs and their TA's are worse. Academia is full of lazy admins and lame teachers.  Plus, the student loan costs are atrocious. The seeker felt depressed because of the test, her lack of work experience, and her lack of work experience. In this conversation, the seeker has not told the supporter that she is under stress. The supporter can tell the seeker things like to study for the upcoming exams, or to take the AP or IB classes.	labels:I understand that college can be financially demanding.
text:It is a rip off for what you get..... Hopefully, my student loans will be forgiven by President Joe Biden in 2021. My anxiety is from the costs of college as well. The seeker is worried about college costs. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take advantage of the loan forgiveness. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to do an online application for the loan forgiveness.	labels:You need to think that you will have a secure job once you graduate, and every debt will be eventually paid off even if Biden doesn't forgive it.

The supporter could tell the seeker to ask friends or other people to talk to their friends, they can learn from them.	labels:Not at all, I think what you are experiencing is completely normal, and you just have to cope with it in the most optimistic way possible. Maybe getting your assignments done in time will be helpful for your anxiety. After that, you will have tons of time to spend with friends, family, or simply leisure time to do what you enjoy.
text:Yeah, tha is true. . Thank you for taking the time to hear my grief. "Good Grief." The seeker feels anxious and worried about her end of school. The supporter could suggest that she take a different approach to her anxiety by going to other websites and forms or to see a counselor.	labels:It is a pleasure to help : )	episode_done:True
text:Hello there. In the past 3 years, I have gotten into 2 car accidents. Neither of them were my fault. I sustained a concussion/traumatic brain injury and am experiencing depression and PTSD. I have nightmares of crashing at least 2x a week. I am seeing a therapist, but due to the pandemic we are not meeting in person to do EDMR for my PTSD. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to a counselor.	labels:Hello, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds like an awful lot to go through in a few years time, which now can feel like the time passes so quickly.

The supporter could tell the seeker to start a study group.	labels:Have you tried to talk to your therapist through video chat or is that something they offer?
text:Yes, I talk to my therapist every other week. The seeker was able to talk about her traumatic brain injury. The supporter could ask her if she felt in a safe environment to talk about her trauma.	labels:That's great that they can offer that, I know it's very difficult to get regular care at the moment with the pandemic. Do you have any family or friends close by or something that you can talk to if you feel like you need some extra support?
text:I do not have supportive or understanding friends and family. I have lost a lot of them in the last few years or have created boundaries because when I got into my first car accident, legit someone said "are you not better yet?" and another said "can't you just walk it off?" When I got into my second car accident, people said "again? are you drunk?" Even though neither were my fault, people were not understanding or asked how scary those situations for me were. The seeker feels like her friends and family are ignoring her due to her trauma and PTSD. The supporter can suggest that she can talk to them through video chat.	labels:I am sorry to hear that, people are very quick to judge so it's very unfortunate that you were treated that way.

He said to my aunt "sorry for your loss" My aunt said "oh, she's right over there and alive" the car accident was so bad the tow truck guy thought I had died. but even after seeing my car, friends and family acted like it was just something that happens to everyone. walk it off. The seeker has been treated rudely. The supporter could let the seeker tell the seeker that he or she did not want to walk it off.	labels:Wow, I can't imagine what the car must have looked like then for such a comment to be made. I'm glad that you here and despite going through that trauma that you are still going.
text:Thanks. The seeker feels like it is okay to walk it off. The supporter could suggest a reward for the seeker to keep going. The supporter could also suggest a talk with a friend or family member.	labels:A women fell asleep at the wheel in 2013 and hit me going through an intersection and totaled by car as well, but I had only had a concussion and pain I had to go to physical therapy for a short time, so I can't imagine how you must have felt.
text:What are some things you do when you have depression? Have you been in a scary car accident before or know anyone? Have you offered them kindness or you just dismissed them and thought it was their own problem? That sounds scary. And is extremely unfortunate. The seeker says that she has depression and thinks that maybe she could overcome it by not dwelling on the past to deal with it. The supporter could tell the seeker to be honest and say they have been through a lot, to not think that she is a bad person or are not capable of overcoming depression.	labels:I'm sorry that you didn't get the support you needed after your accidents because it's hard enough to go through the pain and trauma (mental and physical) to begin with and the support is much needed.
text:Absolutely! But I'm doing better now. You find out who your real friends and family are and you move on. The whole saying of "they don't deserve you at your best when they weren't there when you were at your worst" The seeker does not accept support from friends and family. The supporter can tell the seeker that she needs to be better than the situation. The supporter could also remind the seeker to find a therapist or set up a support group.	labels:You are 100% correct. Have you looked into any support groups at all or tried to connect with anyone with similar experiences through social media?.
text:I don't use social media. I quit in 2016, which is also when I started realizing how vain people are. Some of those same friends and family didn't bother to text me even though they had my number. I did find a local group that did social stuff together but they were all really old like 50 years plus. I'm in my 20s so it was hard to relate. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated because of their car accident. The supporter could ask her to look into groups that do similar things. The supporter could also ask her to talk to relatives, friends and so on.	labels:Gotcha! Well I'm glad I was able to connect with you this evening because sometimes it helps just to chat and have someone listen :-).
text:Thanks! I appreciate it. Happy Holidays and Happy New Year. The seeker talks about being a victim of the accident, but the supporter should ask the seeker if that is the reason she is feeling so vulnerable. The supporter could encourage her to find support groups and get help, if needed.	labels:I hope that for 2021 things can somewhat go back to normal so the routines can get back to what they were and that this next year is your best year yet.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk about what she can control.	labels:I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world.

text:yha. also, im worried i might fail again if i get too distracted by my family. The seeker feels frantic about failing, but the supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you?.
text:i mean, tutoring is just another added time commitment. I really failed the first time because i was depressed and unmotivated. which is why I'm excited to be with my family finally. The seeker is excited about the possibility of having a private tutoring. The supporter should encourage the seeker to do private tutoring.	labels:Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances.
text:yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet. that i failed. The seeker feels stressed and worried about the upcoming exams. This could be a symptom of the anxiety that comes from not having a good work situation or a bad work situation. The supporter should make sure that the seeker is not stressed and worried about the exam.	labels:I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think.
text:what if they're disappointed. The seeker feels pressured to take the test. The supporter could ask the seeker to set up a time to talk with her family. In this conversation, the seeker feels pressured to take the test because she feels the test will be a big test of her future.	labels:If they love you, and I am sure that your family do, then they will accept what has happened without criticism.
text:how do i even begin to start the conversation. The seeker is hesitant or unsure about the topic. The supporter should ask the seeker to think through the topic and see if there are any positives or negatives.	labels:Well, do you have any siblings that you are close to and that you could tell first?.
text:yeah i told my twin sister, actually. The seeker has talked to her twin sister, and her sister has told her that she is doing well. She also tells the supporter that she has friends and family that she needs to talk to about her depression.	labels:It is good to hear you have a twin. Are you very close?.
text:definitely. we go to different schools but we live together in nyc. The seeker heard from her twin sister, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her sister.	labels:Well I think that it might be a very good idea if she could approach the rest of your family and maybe even your therapist on your behalf?.
text:yha she's better at breaking bad news than i do... maybe i can ask her. i think i should tell my therapist myself though. The seeker is told that she can tell her family and her therapist. The supporter could tell the seeker that it would be a good idea.	labels:Well, your therapist is not, in my mind, as important as  your family. But I think that both will understand!.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHi. The seeker feels relaxed and calmer. The supporter could also ask the seeker to leave her work to go out and study. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should learn a new language, go to yoga, or practice meditation.	labels:How may I help you today?

text:My supervisor said she would be in to help cover people on PTO and she never showed.. The seeker feels angry because of the supervisor not showing up. The supporter should ask for more information about the situation.	labels:So your boss never showed up to cover people on PTO is that correct?
text:yes. The seeker is unhappy at her supervisor for not covering people for PTO. The supporter could tell the seeker about PTO and how to overcome this.	labels:Did anybody ever get in contact with her and to see why she never showed up?
text:Yes, she said she decided she was also taking PTO. Even though she had already said she would help cover. The seeker feels angry because her boss did not show up to cover PTO work. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for a meeting with her supervisor.	labels:I understand how you are feeling because i would be angry to. I feel like she should of let everyone know that before she decided to do that.
text:Agreed, but at this point I just need to get over it so I can help pick up the slack. But i'm just so upset. The seeker feels angry because she is not getting in contact with her supervisor because she was afraid to.	labels:Have you personally had a conversation with her and tell her how you was feeling?
text:No, i'm afraid to bring it up. The seeker feels angry about being outed and being told what she didn't want to hear. The supporter should ask her to talk to her supervisor to find out why she did not show up.	labels:Don't be afraid to bring it up because you did nothing wrong.
text:But what if she gets mad? The seeker is afraid to bring up the topic of the supervisor. The supporter could help the seeker to have a conversation with the supervisor.	labels:I don't see why she would get mad but if she does then just leave it alone and move on and just do your job. That is what i would do.
text:Yea, I guess so. The seeker feels not told by her boss, but her supervisor. She feels hurt because she doesn't get what she wants. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should talk to friends or seek therapy.	labels:I honestly do not think she will get mad just try to talk to her. I would just let it go because to me it's not worth being mad over for a long time you have to just let it go.
text:I think I will. I guess i'm worried because I had already expressed my concern with having multiple people on PTO and she specifically said, "it's okay because I can help cover". So she just completely disregarded what I said. The seeker feels worried about having multiple people on PTO because of her fear of not getting along with other people. The supporter could recommend the seeker to set up a study group or attend a seminar to help the seeker feel more comfortable about her feelings.	labels:I understand she should of talked to you about changing her mind.
text:So is it even worth bringing it up at all? The seeker feels anxious because of the PTO and the supervisor's delays. The supporter should try to work on calming the seeker down or at least letting her know her supervisor is going to be there to support her.	labels:I mean you know it won't hurt to try to bring it up and see what happens. seems to me your boss is not doing her job right.	episode_done:True

I can tell how upset you feel just from talking to you, and also that the method of the break up is  really sore point..
text:It just disgusts me how gauche my girl's method was.  Maybe people should be more polite about how they communicate about something like breaking up. The seeker feels annoyed by the friend. The supporter could help the seeker by telling the seeker that friend can be a very nice person. The supporter could also tell the seeker that you know people who are not good to talk to.	labels:It could be that you are better off without her?

The supporter can tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences.

Do you really think that your friend would do a t hing like that to you?.
text:I have seen Rick eyeballing my girl at times.  I think he is an agressive guy when it comes to the ladies. Rick thinks that he is a "playah." The seeker is disgusted by the friend. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to a friend or to talk to a therapist.	labels:Do you think that perhaps you should talk to him before anything happens?

text:Thanks friend I love your style I follow it too. The seeker is happy that she has a job so she can support herself. The supporter should give the seeker some advice.	labels:Awesome!

text:I don't now how to cope with this pandemic any more is getting out of hand. The seeker felt tense and worried about the prospect of being sent to a program. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get outside help from a friend or acquaintance. The supporter could also ask the seeker to try to get more information on how to cope with the anxiety.	labels:What is the worst part of it for you? Can you identify that? I'll be honest, my husband and I don't even see anyone dying..
text:It is serious here about half of my neighbor are affected, The seeker feels bad about her neighbor not being affected. The supporter should encourage the seeker to read up on it. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a pill to cure the condition.	labels:Half your neighbors died?
text:Not really but every day ambulance must come to pick one or two because of an emergency. The seeker thinks about the toll of the pandemic. The supporter could suggest to ask her neighbors to report their loved ones.

text:I am feeling depression right now. The seeker believes that she may be depressed. The supporter should tell her to seek professional help.	labels:I can understand feeling depressed. I think that can be debilitating at times, however there are ways to cope and help you get out of it.. I used to struggle a lot with depression, but not much anymore. I learned a lot of coping strategies. I can share a few of those with you if you want.. One of the best ways is to take a walk. Get outside, get fresh air. Look at the sky and the clouds and the trees and the grass. This will not only physically refresh you but help your health as well.
text:I am really afraid here I don't know what to do. The seeker is afraid for her life. The supporter could tell her to talk to her friends and find professional therapy.	labels:As for the pandemic, if you know no one who has died, I wouldn't worry about it. The CDC has no reported deaths of anyone healthy. People who are unhealthy die, not the healthy, and people who are sick ALREADY are the ones who die. If you are relatively healthy, then you are good to go. Do things to protect your health. What are you eating? What are you drinking? Are you talking to friends and getting social life? Are you getting fresh air? Thinking good thoughts?  Or are you living in fear when you are not going to a lot of funerals.. It is well documented that our immune system is affected by our mental state, so it is important that you care for your health. Focusing on the negativity of the pandemic will bring you down. Focusing on being healthy and taking care of your mind, soul, spirit and body will help build up your immunity and make you strong.
text:I don't like the noise of ambulance at all any time I see one I don't feel happy. The seeker feels anxious about the noise of ambulance. The supporter should encourage the seeker to get out of the house, go to the park and have some fresh air.	labels:I can understand an ambulance sound is hard to hear, but even that can be turned around. You can pray for the person, then switch your mind off. If you focus on the negative, you will stay negative. If you do what you can (pray) then there is nothing else to do. Focusing on the negative will depress you.. One thing I did to help with depression is keep a checklist of things to do when I felt down:  call a friend, call a loved one to encourage THEM, go for a walk, eat fruits and veggies, read a book, go for a bike ride, etc.  Things like that, then I chose to do those things despite how I felt. Doing those things helped my mood TREMENDOUSLY>. Feelings follow thoughts. If you think negative thoughts, you will feel negative. If you think positive thoughts, you will feel positive. Sometimes this takes time, but it works.  Just because you feel sad doesn't mean you should just do nothing, a person can TALK their way out of sadness and choose to do something different..
text:Thanks your words of encouraging help me a lot. The seeker feels so much support, but the seeker doesn't feel that she is strong enough to deal with the situation. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get therapy.	labels:I am glad you were able to talk about how this is affecting you. I think many people are affected. And I encourage you to really do things you like and enjoy to keep your mood better. If you feel down, talk about it, pray about it but do NOT dwell on it, because that will bring you down. Sometimes we get in a funk, when we do, we can pull ourselves out, I do suggest you write a list of things to do and put on the frige.
text:You are very correct I like you a lot. The seeker has a list of things to do to help her moods, and it starts to feel more positive. The supporter could remind the seeker to be positive and to take care of herself.	labels:Thank you, how very sweet!  I do thank you for sharing your life with me. I'm an older person and this has affected me too.  Life is full of ups and downs, so I've been through some rough times. You can do this! :D.
text:Lovely I love meeting people like you who has words of wisdom. The seeker reveals that she is depressed, but that she doesn't want to talk about this. The supporter can tell the seeker to talk to a friend or a loved one who has opinions on things. The supporter could also tell the seeker to take a walk and talk to a friend or someone who is happy.	labels:I had one more thought about when the ambulance comes by and you get upset. Pray for the person, pray for the workers. They are the ones who CAN do something about the sick people. You cannot. You didn't become an ambulance worker. I am not an ambulance worker, I cannot help them either, but I can pray God can help them do their job. Then I let it go.. I cannot worry about what is not my job. I have a home and family to care for and pets and neighbors.  So this is what I can do, I cannot fix the sick so the ambulance workers do their job, I do mine. When I try to do their job and worry all about them and the sick people, it's not my job and there will be no peace doing the wrong job. If that makes sense..
text:Thanks I will continue praying for them. The seeker is angry at the ambulance workers. The supporter should tell the seeker that the ambulance workers are there to help the sick people. The supporter could also say that the ambulance workers are there to help the sick people, but are not responsible for the sick people. The supporter could say that the ambulance workers can help the sick people, but they can't do all the wrong things.	labels:If that is all, then you simply finish the hit. I am sure you will do just fine! .
text:Thanks for everything you are too good. Goodbye. The seeker feels relieved that she has someone to pray for. The supporter could also tell the seeker to go to church and pray for the ministry and the person with the disease. The supporter could do that during break time.

This can be a very stressful time of year, I know..
text:all of it and I seem so little compared to everyone else like im just walking and wearing a ton of shame around me. ya I feel so drowned out by everyone else I feel like I am clothed from head to toe in it. The seeker feels a lack of friends. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to feel alone, but there may be a lot of people around her. The supporter could also suggest that there are other people on the other side of the world. The supporter could remind the seeker of the opportunities to share and the amazing things that are happening around the world.	labels:So you are feeling worried deep down about something right now? Would you like to tell me more about ti?.
text:I dunno if its worried so much as feeling so little compared to it. worr. worried might not be the right emotion. you are really supportive btw 8o))) The seeker is worried about the holiday and the friend problems. The supporter could suggest that the seeker talk to friends or has a friend that can help. The supporter could also ask the seeker to join a study group or a study group to start to get some motivation.	labels:Do you think that perhaps you feel numb to things that are going on even though you should be worried about them?.
text:No i think i feel dumb but its not numb. one time i went to the dentist and he gave me a shot in my mouth that was numb this is kinda of a prickley feeling its not numbness.. something close but a stutter mayber. The seeker is feeling less than the supporter. The supporter could suggest that the seeker may be needing some help. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker needs to be more active in their life.	labels:I see - that is interesting, I have never heard of anything like that before. Do you think that there might be some sort of physical problem going on?.

text:Yea I have been smoking cigarettes for to long all bs aside.. Im going really try to get out of the habit of it this year. hopefully get out of where im staying to.. to a bigger place. The seeker is smoking cigarettes. The supporter should ask about this. The supporter should ask what the seeker is doing to get out of the habit of smoking cigarettes. The supporter should also ask if there is anything else that is going on with the seeker and if it is the other way round.	labels:I smoke too much too.

text:ya cigarettes they getting up much a pack they really are a waste of money. especially if you dont have alot of money like me. ya Im really going to try. total waste of money make you smell bad. The seeker realizes she is going to lose money by smoking and has to try to save money for a long term goal. The supporter could put up a list of ways to save money for the New Year.	labels:Nearly ten pounds a pack here (UK). I am gonna try and save up for a new handbag!.
text:hope you kick it to. ya im in the us they about 8 to 10 dollars here in the usa. The seeker is feeling the amount of money the money is a waste of time and time is wasted.

text:Hey. I am really scared about my job prospects. I am really fearful about my job situation. The seeker is fearful that her job is not great. The supporter could suggest to talk to someone in her office to make sure she is not being pressured to take the job.	labels:When did this fear start?
text:It has been a while. I have had fears going back to my childhood traumas. I think that the work situation has only exacerbated that. The current economic climate has really made me fearful....not sure if I am going to be able to keep my job. The seeker feels fearful because of the current economic climate.

The seeker told the supporter that she was going through a break up. The supporter could help the seeker to talk about the situation.	labels:I have been in that position too. I hate it when I realise that I am not being rational but I can't seem to stop myself sometimes and this has sometimes let to problems with my inter personal relationships.

And when he broke up with me, I tried to get him to spend the night with me in a hotel, and I felt so pathetic because I was practically begging for sex. I think I am an addict. The seeker talks about needing help. The supporter can tell that the seeker is feeling dissatisfied.	labels:I hear you on that one too!

The supporter could tell the seeker to get cognitive therapy.	labels:I understand that as well .. I am on medication for it. A dog is a wonderful thing to have! Do you feel that it has helped you?.

text:well, i'm not disgusted with myself... it's just people in general. everybody.. they're so selfish. any they all care about superifical things. The seeker is disgusted with herself because she is not a caring person. The supporter can tell the seeker that the person's are selfish and that the person's are not really loving.

Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?.

My friends have a lot of money, though, and none of them are even happy. thats even more saddening. The seeker feels disgusted about wasting money. The supporter should tell her to buy the things that she does like.	labels:I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!.
text:Yea, I know, right. I have one friends who has probably about 100k in the bank, and he will complain if he spent 4 cents too much on gas over another gas station. The seeker says that she has no friends with money. The supporter should remind the seeker that money is not disposable. The supporter can also ask the seeker to rethink the life that she has been living.	labels:People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them..

Probably true. sometimes when i bring it up they'll just argue about it and defend themselves. i just try to move on but it is always there. ok. yea it is 15 minutes so bye bye. good talking. The seeker feels like a hypocrite because she doesn't feel like the person she is in a time frame.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she will make her life better.	labels:I honestly didn't eat very healthy. If you live with your parents, I think a proper nutrition is easier.

text:okay i understand, and what do you suggest for when you do poorly on an exam that you studied so hard for, how do you keep yourself from feeling down?

The supporter could then ask the seeker to learn more about the guy and talk to him.

text:I guess all people are different. I generally trust people easily.. The seeker feels insecure about trusting women. The supporter could suggest to go on date with a friend or a man friend to get more confidence.

text:That is true. He is but, has been distant lately.. The seeker feels that her partner is distant and doesn't love her.

The supporter could tell the seeker that he or she has a right to be jealous if they see the other person's romantic feelings. The supporter could also try to make the seeker laugh.	labels:Yes, workers can be a real problem and can make up stories about people. Slander in the work place happens. Unfortunately, lies and rumors are just that.

The supporter could encourage the seeker to visit her website for more information about the researcher.	labels:Find things that he has in common or energize the relationship.

The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:How do you all generally communicate? Through text?
text:He is going to law school and I am going to med school. There is a ton of stress on both ends. The seeker has made a genious connection with her partner and feels that there is nothing to worry about. The supporter could suggest that the seeker can learn about how to communicate through text.	labels:Which do you and your man like to communicate?

text:I swear, I can't take these lockdowns anymore. The seeker feels locked-out from her job because of the lockdowns. The supporter should tell the seeker to work on getting more motivation from her friends and family.	labels:I can definetely understand why. During this pandemic we have been more isolated than ever. It's not easy.
text:I mean it's one thing to limit capacities in places, but to say we're not allowed to go to our friends' and family's home is just plain ridiculous. . The seeker felt that she can't take the lockdowns. The supporter could tell the seeker to think about how she is going to go after her friend's house or family.	labels:It is more than reasonable to be frustrated with regards to that. I myself have not been able to visit my ill mother. She lives in another country, so it's especially difficult.
text:That is a shame. I mean I know people can still do Zoom or Facetime, but I imagine you can related to me in knowing that both of those options are not the same as face to face.. The seeker is frustrated because of Zoom. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to Zoom instead.	labels:Exactly, the experience feels like it lacks the main connection we share with our loved ones. It is totally normal to want to be face to face instead.
text:I think that's the other thing that these lockdowns are doing; they're sucking the emotional aspects out of activities and pastimes we love. Instead of laughing or jumping with fright in theaters with everyone, we now have to do it with ourselves. Rather than cheering as an audience over a touchdown, it's now a crowd of one. It just feels robotic now.. The seeker feels that she is being asked to do something robotic because of the lockdowns. The supporter should try to get the seeker to talk about how she has been feeling in the past.	labels:I agree with you, what used to be super-exciting activities now have a much more monotonous feeling. However, it's not the end of the world. Thankfully, researchers have just came up with a vaccine prototype I heard.
text:Yeah, but even with the distribution, some people are saying that things won't return to normal till about late spring/early summer.. It's certainly maddening. The seeker is angry about the lockdowns, but believes that this is just the way the world is. The supporter can tell the seeker that they should give it time, and that they will probably get something better than what they are experiencing.	labels:I know it's not easy, but try to think of this whole situation of a challenge that you are overcoming. What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. You will come out of this ready for any hardships that life might throw at you.
text:I guess, I still think our responce to this was sloppy at best. I mean, lockdown the healthy masses due to a discease with a 99% survival rate? It just doesn't make sense in my book. I'm just glad this silliness will be over soon. The seeker feels that the lockdowns are draining her life. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to start doing better at school and work. The supporter could also tell the seeker to go to the gym on a regular basis.	labels:It will hopefully be over sooner than we think. Just try to keep a positive attitude, focus on the things you like, and time will fly. I know it can be hard, but I am sure you got this.
text:I think over time (sooner than later hopefully) I'll be able to get over it. Thank you very much for talking to me. The seeker is happy, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share her story.	labels:It has been a pleasure : )

text:Yes. The seeker feels that she has been ghosted by her partner. The supporter should ask the seeker why she got ghosted.	labels:I can imagine that you must be really hurt amongst a number of other feelings. Hearing you tell me that he has done this is upsetting to me as well. I've had the same thing done to me and I can remember being extremely distraught.
text:Yeah, I just do not know what to do. The seeker feels that the supporter has unfairly been treated. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:Do you mind me asking what the argument was about? If you don't mind going into a little more detail, I may be able to help you more.
text:I was sick and he did not call me all day to even check in on me. I told him that I was upset about that. The seeker feels upset because of the argument. The supporter could ask the seeker to share about what happened and why she got ghosted.	labels:That must be such a terrible feeling. So the argument started because you were sick, he didn't check in on you at all for that entire day, and when you expressed your feelings to him, it turned into an argument? Has he ever acted this way towards you before? For example, has he ever shown a lack of empathy towards you like this in the past? Are you still there? Have you tried reaching out to him throughout the course of these past two weeks to see if he would respond? I would really like to help you find a solution to this problem, but it appears as though you may not be active anymore. I'm going to wait a few more minute for you to respond before cancelling the chat. In the event that I don't hear back from you, I wish you the best!	episode_done:True

The seeker is worried about her mood because of her new job and lost friends. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go back to the friends she had previously.	labels:Feeling down after an experience like that is certainly understandable, and I suspect that might be the main cause of your depression. Regarding losing your job, I wouldn't worry too much. New businesses are opening each day as the pandemic slowly goes away. You will have plenty of job opportunities. Similarly, you will also regain your confidence and social status as you interact with society more.
text:Yes, but its a vicious circle. Get blue and find it hard to strive. Unfortunately many jobs require background checks these days. Even Amazon! Hope with the vaccine that things will look up. The seeker feels hopeless about job situation because she was in prison. The supporter could suggest she to go to a jailor and ask for help. Likewise, she can also talk about her day job or go to her school.	labels:I am feeling optimistic about this vaccine, you will see how it helps us all slowly get our lives back to how they were.
text:Yeah. The covid thing is an additional layer of isolation and depression. The seeker feels isolated and depressed because of the depression and isolation.

text:I am anxious about an upcoming test. The seeker feels anxious because of exams.

The supporter should ask the seeker to find a way to be more creative.	labels:I would suggest that you study as much as you can.

text:Yes I am pretty good about that but it just kills my free time because I am working full time. The seeker is stressed about work, but doesn't say why. The supporter should be able to help the seeker tell in a more specific way what the problem is.	labels:I understand. However, you need to be able to find some time dedicated to your school activities. You are the one who needs to decide how to insert it in your schedule.
text:Yes honestly I am the main driver behind me doing all this schooling it is just going to be good for my career and I don't just want to stand still.

You will be doing what you like for a good living. Think about the future.
text:That is certainly the plan. The seeker is in a good mood because she is excited to be going to school. The supporter should ask the seeker to follow through on her plan.	labels:Just remember not to stress too much about it. It's just one test at the end of the day, you can do this!

The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a schedule in the work place where they can schedule their work and study.	labels:Happens to all of us. I myself sometimes get too invested in work and the days go by without me realizing it, but it should definetely be a priority.

The supporter can tell the seeker that she should not be too busy because of the stress and the pressure.

The seeker does not tell her friends how she feels, she does not ask for their help and she does not ask for support. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends, to ask for support and to use a group.	labels:I understand. However, there is nothing wrong with telling them that you are sad because you miss them. Something as simple as getting it off your chest can already make you feel better.
text:I suppose. I just worry that I will make them sad too. It's hard time for everyone. The seeker feels worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is hard time for everyone.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker needs to spend more time with her boyfriend and her friends.

The seeker feels insecure about trust issues, but the reason is not related to the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker that when they open up, they can feel all around.	labels:Hey, if he is the right one for you, he will completeley accept you as you are and love you. In the unlikely event that he "rejects" you for being "vulnerable", he wasn't even worth it in the first place. You deserve someone that appreciates you as much as you appreciate them :3.

The supporter could suggest an art group or a group on Facebook, and ask the seeker to get some friends to help her.	labels:Yea, I can see why that may make you feel alone in that aspect.

text:Personally I've heard that Reddit can be really toxic. The seeker feels alone because she did not have the support of others. The supporter could say that the seeker has a lot of anger from her past and that it is time to let it out.	labels:It can be, but seeing several posts in their groups, most offer advice or at least sympathy.

I know there will be numerous options out there for you in retail management, but if you wanted to do something different, there will be opportunities there too.

text:Very true. I'm going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better. The seeker feels better because of the support.

The seeker feels stressed because it is the first time she is going back to her family and home. The supporter should encourage the seeker to explore other options.	labels:It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.
text:Yeah thats really the reason I wanted to go away from college. I dont really have my own space when I'm here. People just come in and out of my room as they please in spite of how busy I am. The seeker is worried about being home because of the distractions. The supporter can tell the seeker to talk to friends and do what is required.	labels:Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries. I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh. Have you told your family about the issues your having?
text:I honestly am worried that they will be disappointed. Maybe that's crazy. I just remember how proud they were when I got this scholarship. I don't want them to blame me. The seeker feels important about her scholarship. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is worried about being disappointed.	labels:OK, that makes sense. Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers.
text:Yeeah thats why im not officially failed. My teacher gave me an extention on my final. So, I'm working on it, but i just can't focus. The seeker feels stressed because of the extention. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up events to help focus on her studies.	labels:Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself. Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.	episode_done:True
text:Hello how can I help you?\nKind of mad. The seeker is mad because he did not get in the program. The supporter should allow the seeker to think about what could have gone wrong. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to apply for a job.	labels:May I ask the reason why you are mad?
text:My friends got me banned on Playstation. People I've known for 4 years. The seeker feels mad because of Playstation. The supporter could suggest the seeker to like Playstation.	labels:were their actions accidental or intentional?

The seeker feels mad because of the friends. The supporter could notice that the seeker is not feeling happy about the friend.	labels:Did you say anything offensive?
text:Kind of. My friend asked what is up and my girlfriend of course was nosey and said bad cuz my mom is harassing us. I was saying my mom has been ripping me off and keeps threatening to kick me out. So I just said. I honestly am at the point where I don't care if she is around or not. So someone reported me for some bs thing on playstation cuz they think I must be trash if I don't love my mom or something. The seeker has said that she is mad about her friend, but the supporter could mention that she has not said anything offensive.	labels:I see.  If that is the case, create a personal meeting with you and your friends (the ones who banned you)..
text:My mom is kind of a draining person. I thought of being around because she has been going through low hemoglobin. But she keeps ruining my life. I wish I could. I don't even know  the jerk. The rest of them then did it because they don't like my girlfriend. The seeker feels drained because of there goal of not hurting any one person. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to take care of the people around her. The supporter could also tell the seeker that her mom needs to do the same.	labels:just to clarify, are these online friends?  Have you met them in person?
text:Online friends. I only know one. the one who was on the phone with me. he just can't keep a call private for anything. The seeker feels that her friend is a jerk. The supporter could remind the seeker of how to keep cool about things.	labels:and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally?

So... my girlfriend has this condition and was in a hospital for high contamination in her blood from her bad liver. So she was talking weird. and everyone was calling her annoying.

The supporter could also ask her to seek professional help.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that..
text:But those insensentive morons don't care she literally almost died. Instead, everyone just keeps asking why am I with this disabled girl. Like... she is better now. She just needed to recover. People I knew for four years... going out of their way to mess with me. The seeker does not know the other friends personally because he was bs about her. The supporter should be able to tell the seeker that he or she is not the only one being a jerk.	labels:The best advice I can give you is to try to get your friends together on a private group call.  Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation.. However, if they do not respect your response, then they can't really be relied on as your friends.  They don't come to respect you so it is best for you to move on..
text:Yeah. I mostly tried to stay to my myself. Right now they're mad at me because they got all warnings from Sony. since they did an investigation on how everyone speaks. The seeker is discouraged because of the PSN investigation of her friends.

text:Even my own sister is giving me crap because my nephew almost lost thousands worth of games. The seeker feels angry because she was told by her friends that she was a bad person. The supporter could also remind the seeker to get friends and get them together to unban her.	labels:Also send a report to Sony about the ban.  I believe with the proof, they can appeal the ban for you!
text:cuz of the warning... Like I can control what these people do when I'm offline. I did... they said they can't do anything. and that I can just report them. Kind of sucks but I guess I will just stick my lane. Karma already banned someone in the group. took $2000 worth of games. so that gave me a good laugh. The seeker feels attacked by the group for being "anti-social". The supporter could ask the seeker what she is against.	labels:In that case just keep reporting them. .

She can also encourage the seeker to be more affectionate with her nephew, and to stop being so negative.	labels:If he's relying on your payments for the content, then I suggest for you to stop the payments until he learns his lesson..
text:Well my friend just said it's my fault for buying ourselves game on his account. The seeker is angry at her nephew for buying the game. The supporter could also call the nephew responsible for buying the game.	labels:He clearly does not respect you so you need to set up some discipline and ground rules..
text:that prick. For now... I am just left on my own. The seeker feels like she is alone. The supporter should keep in mind that many people in the group are on their phones or texting the other person and are in a state of anger. The supporter could suggest to set up a game call to figure out what needs to be done.	labels:Honestly, he's your nephew.  So the fault lies on his parents..
text:Maybe so. I think he'll get around. The seeker feels used by her friend and family. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to disappoint your friends. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to stay away from the family and work with that person.	labels:But I really do hope you get your account back.  I'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend..
text:Yeah. She started thinking all of my friends are like that but she figured out I have some good ones. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. The seeker feels like they are not using their own money to pay for the game but rather some money is being spent on them by the community. The supporter would also suggest that the seeker should get a restraining order against the person who is harassing her.	labels:And I hope my advice/suggestions have been helpful!
text:It was thank you very much. The seeker feels lucky to have a friend who can make her feel like she is a good friend.

The supporter could ask the seeker to take on a group of people as a group to find motivation to appreciate people.	labels:What's the reason?
text:People are so rude and mean to me. A lot of people call me annoying too. The seeker is being rude, mean and not friends with everyone. The supporter could tell the seeker to take back the words.	labels:it's their fault , not yours. don't worry..
text:I feel bad because more than one person has said it. Maybe I am just annoying. The seeker is bothered by being called annoying. The supporter could suggest the seeker to be less negative and to try to talk to other people.	labels:Be as you always have been.
text:Sometimes I'm afraid of being myself because I don't want to annoy people. The seeker feels be bad because of being self conscious.

text:I guess I shouldn't. But it's hard to express myself sometimes. The seeker feels like she is not good enough. The supporter could tell the seeker to work on being more confident.	labels:ok, i did understand...
text:Im not really changing myself. I'm too afraid to express myself. What if I express myself and I annoy someone? The seeker is afraid of expressing herself, but the supporter could not tell the seeker that it is not her responsibility to be annoying. The supporter could also suggest to start a study group or something to vent out of the situation.	labels:it doesn't matter what others say about us, do your duty properly ok.
text:Sometimes what other people say bothers and hurts me deeply. The seeker is hurt by a potential future of being annoying. The supporter could tell the seeker to ask for support from friends and people close to her. The supporter could also ask the seeker to read a book on how to be nice to people.	labels:don't think about that..
text:Sometimes its hard to not think about it. The seeker feels bad because others are not respecting her personality. The supporter could tell the seeker that her personality is not respected and that she needs to change.	labels: share your comments it is their choice whether to accept or disagree, but you don't change anything.
text:I understand. The seeker feels uncomfortable with what other people say about her. The supporter should take the seeker and have a conversation with her. The supporter should explain to the seeker that she can learn from certain people and not just people who are close to her.	labels:Hmm good.
text:Well thank you. im okay. The seeker is about to be rude to someone. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try creating a better relationship with one of the people whom she likes.	labels:Hmm all the best.	episode_done:True
text:Good evening.\nGood evening, thanks for taking the time to talk with me. The seeker does not speak. The supporter should also ask the seeker to do some research for gossiping about the seeker about her life situation.	labels:No problem. How can I help you tonight?

text:At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids. The seeker feels disgusted and wants to end the relationship with her father. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look into counseling.	labels:Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.
text:The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it. The seeker feels disgusted by her children and her father. The supporter could suggest that the seeker talk to school officials to find out why the child's father broke up with her.	labels:I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.
text:I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?! The seeker says she is upset over her boyfriend's affair. The supporter should tell the seeker that the issues could be resolved with the help of the father, but it may take time.	labels:Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.
text:Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do? The seeker feels disrespected by the supporter. The supporter could ask the seeker to set up a meeting with the children and talk with them. The supporter could also ask the seeker to ask the children what they think.	labels:This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.
text:I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point. The seeker has been through similar experience, but the supporter should help her by asking the questions. The supporter could ask her how she feels about ending the relationship and how she thinks the child's father feels.	labels:I think that would definitely help! What are some things you like to do?
text:How do I deal with my feelings of disgust? I like to color, I like to read, I like to do puzzles. The seeker does color and does a puzzle. The supporter could tell the seeker that that is a good way to act on her feelings. It could also be a good way to talk about the situation.	labels:You have to know that it wasn't your fault. He was the one who was unfaithful and there is nothing that you did to cause that. This was something I had to keep telling myself as I was trying to process everything. Sometimes it isn't easy, but you are your own biggest supporter. It wasn't your fault.
text:That definitely gave me some strength and closure, thank you so much! The seeker feels disgusted towards her ex-fiance because of her ex-fiance cheating on her.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker should leave the store.	labels:Experts says that when someone get emotional waiting some time might help reduce the tension..
text:You mean should I give her time?. The seeker feels emotionally irritated. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has time to talk things through. The supporter could also ask the seeker to give her time.	labels:That is correct. After some time, when emotion is down, you both can have a discussion about the incident..

The supporter could tell the seeker to let go of the self-hatred and focus on the positives that she has. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to her friends and family.	labels:Is this something you've felt on previous birthdays?
text:yes, the older I get the worse the feeling is. I didn't used to hate birthdays when I was younger. The seeker is feeling self-hated. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk with friends and family.	labels:I'll confess I have felt the same way, especially with "milestone" birthdays (30, 40, 50, etc.). Do you think you are possibly expect too much in terms of achievements?
text:Yes, those are hard. My 30th was difficult. Society has so many wrong ideas of where people need to be, and it just doesn't apply to me. I'm so different from normal people. maybe, but being autistic, even average achievements are hard for me. I have to work so hard just to be average. May I ask, how did you deal with your own birthday depression? Maybe I can learn from you. The seeker feels a lot of depression because of birthday and the supporter could suggest that the seeker talk to her friends to help her.	labels:As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  "normal people" and being "average" really mean. Am I comparing myself to something that even exists?
text:That's what I've been thinking about too. It probably doesn't exist, but society would have us believe otherwise. The seeker feels self-hate, but the supporter could add that it is not always that way. The supporter could also suggest that there are different terms for the seeker to use.	labels:That's so true. It's tough to deal with. But I will same, as I became older, I just stopped caring as much about what other's think. It just happened.
text:Yep, it sure is. I figure people stop caring that much when they get older. The seeker feels uncomfortable. The supporter should talk to the seeker about being "average" in terms of achievements. The supporter could also ask her how she deals with feelings of being average.	labels:Also, I'm sure there are some things in life you are good at, even if those aren't what society seems to value.
text:I've already stopped caring what people younger than me think. They just seem so young to me. yea, it's just hard when I struggle so much with employment. My issues really keep me from succeeding in jobs. Sure, there are things I can do; but they don't seem to help me with anything important in life, if you know what I mean. The seeker is upset about her job and career that is not helping her. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for job opportunities.	labels:Yeah, I hear you. Are you talking to others -  such as professionals, etc. - about your autism?
text:I was forced into therapy as a young person. I think it put me off seeking professional help because I hated the experience. But I talk to other autistic people in support groups online. Also, I'm sorry to cut this off but I need to go soon. I want to tell you you're quite compassionate and kind. The seeker is worried about the future of her career and the future of her life. The supporter should offer her advice on how to overcome her fears and how to cope with her problems.	labels:Being "forced" to do anything is usually a turn off. But it's good to hear there are groups online to help.
text:I've enjoyed talking to you. Yes indeed. It's not a great experience unless you choose it. The seeker feels compassionate, but the supporter could tell the seeker to address her feelings on a more personal level, such as her relationship issues. The supporter could also bring in advice from friends, family, or the therapist.	labels:Oh, thanks. It's always nice to have a real conversation with someone.
text:For sure. May I ask if you're planning to become a counselor? I didn't know if this simulation is for people to get training for that type of wokr. The seeker wishes to get counseling. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are groups online to help.	labels:I haven't planned on it, but I am looking for a career change. But no, this wasn't training for me. Not sure what this simulation is all about :)
text:Oh cool. I think this is a pretty interesting platform. haha me too, but it seemed interesting. The seeker feels lonely, but his/her partner is upbeat and positive. The supporter could tell the seeker that they like the partner's positive attitude.	labels:Yep. Oh well, hope this was worth while for you.
text:I came here the other day and never got matched with anyone so I left. Thanks, it was. And you seem really cool. I guess we can wrap up since it's over 15 mins. and they said we can stop after 15 i think. The seeker has made a decision to stop seeking help. The supporter should explain that decision.	labels:Thanks. Be sure to do something enjoyable on your birthday..
text:Thank you:) Hope you enjoy your day/night. The seeker feels that she has to be happy on any day, and the supporter should encourage her to be happy. In this conversation, the supporter could encourage the seeker to be happy.	labels:OK. Do I just hit "Quit"? I forget.

text:hello, how're you? The seeker is happy to see the supporter. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has helped them.	labels:GOOD. What bring you here today.
text:I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk) The seeker feels sad. The supporters could remind the seeker of the supportive friends, tell the seeker to work on being a team player, and have a supportive friend to listen to the seeker.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that since COVID your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself?
text:Yes. Sure they've tried to stay in touch but it's always me starting the conversation. Or if they start it, it only involves "hi how're you, good how're you," and then the conversation ends. The seeker feels lonely and she is worried about her friends not trying to talk to her. The supporter could tell her to ask her friends to talk to her if they do not want to talk to her.	labels:I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately.  Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way?
text:Yes. They say that because I'm not hanging out with them physically, it's hard. They also say that I don't put effort into conversations when I feel like I am the only one putting in effort (which I have stated and they have said I don't). The seeker feels lonely because she has not been able to make contact with anyone. The supporter could offer her to ask her friends how they are doing. The supporter could also provide her with a way to share her experiences with friends.	labels:So what I hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to COVID and they are choosing to not? Is that correct?
text:Yes this is correct.. The seeker feels that she doesn't put effort in conversations because she doesn't have people to be around. The supporter could ask the seeker to meet with friends.	labels:Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time.  You should not feel bad about what you are doing.
text:Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort. The seeker feels stressed because of the fear of being alone. The supporter could instruct the seeker to take the time to talk to her friends and make sure that she is the only one doing the talking.	labels:Do you have any other friends besides this group?  Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?
text:I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out.. The seeker has met a few people that have similar thoughts. The supporter can suggest that the seeker do hang out with other people without the group.	labels:What hobbies or activities do you like to do?
text:I play field hockey so I train a lot in my basement (because I'm scared to go out to the gym), I listen to music, read, watch Christmas movies, and I love talking to people. Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time. It's just hard finding other friends right now in the times we're living in. The seeker feels lonely because of the sports, but isn't sure if she could get any friends to hang out with. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to ask her friends to help her out and ask them to join a study group or not to make friends at all.	labels:Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!  That does sound like it would keep you busy. Have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to ?
text:I don't want to go actually practice on a field right now because 1.) It's rather cold outside 2.) I have to wear a mask 3.) I'd only shoot on goal, waste gas, and a good chunk of time. But when I have other people it is fun. I haven't tried that because where would I even go? I don't want to be desperate either ya know? The seeker feels bored and lonely because he can't find other people to talk to. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk to other people that are similar to him.	labels:I understand that you feel that you would look desperate but you said you like reading book so there may be some online book clubs that you could join.  I know that I have been involved in those and I didn't feel like I was seen as desperate since there are so many people that want to be social but don't want to put themselves at risk.
text:I never thought of that! That's is an amazing idea -- maybe I will look into that. Thank you for talking with me today. The seeker feels desperate because she is not being seen as a good enough person and she doesn't want to spend time with other people. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to a friend or someone that she knows that is good at socializing.	labels:I am so glad I was able to help. Maybe we can try and set up another time to talk again?
text:Sure! The seeker feels lonely because it sounds like she would feel desperate. The supporter could ask the seeker to go to a coffee shop or go to a friend's house and talk with other people.

text:My friend has been drinking a lot and he cant keep his drunk mouth shut. I'm like ready to completely dump him as a friend in a minute. I mean, it's covid. He should just stay tf home. The seeker feels betrayed by her friend. The supporter could have a specific example of what the seeker said to her friend. The supporter could also talk about other peer pressure in their friendship.	labels:Could you tell him that he could see a professional that could help him quit drinking? What ways could you find some support groups  for your friend regarding his issues?
text:I mean, I have sort of said it before in a really joking way. But now i'm worried it may be a problem. I feel like if he wants help he should find it himself. The seeker feels that if he wants help he should look for a help. The supporter should be the one to ask the seeker to find a support group.	labels:It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.
text:he has completely isolated me from ppl i care about. The seeker feels isolated because of the friend. The supporter needs to tell the seeker that he can find support groups, counseling, and professional help.	labels:How long has this isolating been occurring? I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER.
text:Well, one time he got drunk and kept calling me ugly in a joking way while we were at a party with a group of new ppl. He seems to have an agenda to embarass me. The seeker was worried about getting water because of drinking. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to seek professional therapy.	labels:There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend. I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.
text:I think I have to ask him to get help and withdraw my friendship, completely if he chooses to continue the way he is. The seeker feels cut off from ppl in a joking way, but he is still OK with his friend. The supporter should ask him to talk to ppl in his group to help him better himself.	labels:I am glad to provide suggestions like AA and other support groups.
text:Thank you very much. The seeker feels lonely and nervous about her friend because he has isolated her. The supporter should try to reassure the seeker.	labels:What else can I help you with? Were my suggestions helpful?
text:Yes, I guess I just wonder if I should include our other friends. The seeker knows that her friend has issues, but it is tough for her to tell him that because that friend is also part of the problem. The supporter could also suggest friends to talk to or have a drink with.	labels:I feel that the right suggestions can help.  Alcohol can be a real issue with maintaining meaningful relationships.
text:Is it betrayal if i tell them that he has been drinking excessively? The seeker feels betrayed that she is being treated unfairly by her friend. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to tell the friend that he has been drinking excessively.	labels:You could also be part of his support group if he agrees to AA.

The supporter could also tell the seeker that they are not aware of the situation.	labels:Ok i see so she thinks you are ignoring her?

The seeker does not talk about her friend, but about her fear of losing her. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk about her fear of not being able to talk to people.	labels:I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.

The supporter could also suggest that she should get a job and practice something at least.	labels:Have you tried to talk to her again recently?
text:Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls.. The seeker was upset because it is still not being willing to talk to her. The supporter should tell the seeker that they are aware of her feelings and they will try to help her.	labels:I would give her 2 or 3 days to her self then try to talk to her again.
text:Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her. The seeker did not know what to do so she just told the supporter that she is having problems with her friend. That supporter could tell the seeker that she is having a bad day and that the reason is not known. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she needs to speak to someone about the reason.	labels:Maybe you should go up to her house.
text:Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :( The seeker feels that she should go to her friend's house and risk the safety of others. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to her friend's house.	labels:Right i can understand.
text:We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship.. The seeker feels that she is wasting time with her friend. The supporter should ask for more details about what happened and ask for a time to talk about it.	labels:I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her. Send her a apology card in the mail.
text:I appreciate your suggestions. This sounds like a good option. Thank you so much for your help! The seeker feels bad about the partner declining her friendship and not being able to talk to her.

text:This place is amazing tho and my dad is the cosigner. the landlord would never let my roomies take over the lease with their credit. i'm thinking of kicking all them out, actually. i dont want to. i just want to be friends witgh everyone again. we were all so close. The seeker felt that she was being bullied and did not want to move. If she was not bullied, then the supporter could tell the seeker that she could move.	labels:ok clarify your friendship value.
text:I have 2 roommates that actually moved here with me from my previous apartment. The rest r new but they're sweet and we've really bonded. we all tripped shrooms together one night and we are like really close now. The seeker wants to be friends with everyone.

The seeker feels uncomfortable because she is not comfortable telling her friends about her boyfriend to the supporter.

The seeker feels nervous about friends, but the reason is not given. The supporter could suggest that the seeker is really worried about this happening. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find a new place to live.	labels:That problem would not be possible  if you did not speak.

We have no close friends and family near us, we moved here to a very rural area in KY some years ago, so I understand.. Do you live alone?
text:Yeah I do. The seeker does loneliness because she does not have close friends. The supporter should remind her that she has many friends in the real world.	labels:One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person..
text:How did you meet them online? The seeker is lonely because there is no one close she can relate to. The supporter could suggest that the seeker call those people to talk to them.	labels:On FB in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if I  could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so I just picked women..
text:I feel like I would struggle to establish a connection with someone over the phone. There are no restrictions in my city at the moment so I would really like to meet some people face to face. The seeker does face to face with someone and is feeling lonely. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up private meetings that could be an online meeting.	labels:I was just thinking of ideas for me to make local friends too. Perhaps you could invite people to your home for Christmas, then when they say they have something occurring, perhaps they will realize you are alone and then invite you?. Are there any churches feeding people on Christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.
text:Sadly most people here spend Christmas with their families and are quite private about not inviting outsiders. Last year I spent it with a friend but he is going to his family this year. I can find out about churches, I have no idea. The seeker feels lonely and lonely. The supporter could suggest that the seeker seek support from friends.	labels:I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the FB search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too..

The supporter could suggest that the seeker ask her friends and family to share the loneliness with her.	labels:There always seems to be people in the same boat I am in, it is just a matter of thinking outside the box and perhaps even calling friends and asking for suggestions. I will definitely say a prayer that you find some people to share a meal with..
text:Thanks for listening and for your suggestions. The seeker feels lonely but is excited about connecting with friends. The supporter could be encouraging the seeker to talk to friends first.	labels:You are welcome. Don't give up, keep trying. It is hard.

You have a blessed afternoon and evening!. I believe you have to end the conversation and then we are done! :D.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there. Is there anything bothering you that you'd like to talk about at the moment?.\nHi. Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas. The seeker feels like the supporter is taking the seeker for granted. The supporter should understand that the seeker is feeling sad. The supporter can also ask the seeker to talk to her friends to get her comfort.	labels:Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse..
text:When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay. The seeker says that she has a hard time at Christmas but the supporter should give her new advice about how to deal with the bereavement. The supporter could tell the seeker she needs to be more present and to not be negative. The supporter could also tell her friend and family to try to help her through the grieving process.	labels:So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?.
text:I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us. The seeker feels that she is not being supportive at all. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?.
text:Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that. The seeker feels reluctant to bring people down. The supporter could ask the seeker to learn more about the event.	labels:Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately..
text:Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone. The seeker feels sad because of the death of her mom. The supporter could help the seeker to set up a memorial for her mom.	labels:I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?.

The seeker feels overwhelmed by the bereavement. The supporter could also share that she has a sister.	labels:What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free.
text:Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video... The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell her that there are people who support her and would be willing to give her a phone call. The supporter could also ask to see a therapist.	labels:That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?.
text:The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization. The seeker feels nervous about the doctor. The supporter could mention the doctor talking to the seeker about finding a therapist.	labels:Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have..
text:If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups... Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start? The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to the psychologist.	labels:There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?. I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you..
text:Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet. It's a hard time for making new connections. Thank you - best wishes to you, too! The seeker is hopeful to get help, but the supporter should ask more questions. The supporter could ask the seeker to share some of the things that they have done to help her before she begins to feel alone. The supporter could also ask her to think of ways to help the seeker by giving her some advice.	labels:That is tough ... so you are feeling uprooted as well as bereaved? I can only hope things go well for you.
text:At least I'll never lose another parent... The seeker feels uprooted and bereaved. The supporter should explain the situation to the seeker.	labels:That's a slightly macabre way of looking at it but .. true.. Have a lovely festive season.
text:You too. Bring on 2021!! The seeker has a crush on a friend. The supporter could remind the seeker to talk to friends and maybe talk to a therapist.	labels:quite!! Do press the quit button and take the survey ;).	episode_done:True

text:It makes me mad.  No one says a word to him, he just sleeps and gets paid for it. The seeker feels mad because it is a co worker sleeping. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for a sleeping arrangements.	labels:Has anyone else noticed him sleeping all the time at his desk?
text:My boss said (I have been there for five years) to me one day did I see DE sleeping at his desk? I was floored that it seemed he never saw him do it before.  How could he not? The seeker feels scared that her boss doesn't like her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can do everything to find out what she needs to do to get her boss to like her. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to her boss.	labels:That is really weird how can someone not see him sleeping at his desk.
text:Very weird.  I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor.  Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping. The seeker feels pressured to help his boss. The supporter can tell the seeker to speak to the boss to find out why he is sleeping. It is possible that there is a conflict between the colleague and the boss.	labels:Have you talked to your co worker about it?
text:It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss.  He obviously said nothing. . The seeker feels like there is nothing else to talk about. The supporter could ask the seeker to find a friend or call a friend and tell them about the co worker sleeping at his desk.	labels:if your boss said nothing to him then maybe you should step up and say something even though you are right that is not your place.
text:I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him. The seeker feels like he has been trying to tell her boss about sleeping in his desk. The supporter could ask the seeker to get a manager to come and see.	labels:Your boss does not sound like a good boss at all and not doing his job correctly.

text:You're probably correct.  I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change. The seeker feels bad because the supporter did not do anything to help her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to give some support and talk to her boss.

text:Seriously, over two years.  True. The seeker is worried that her co worker is sleeping all the time at his desk. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her boss about it.	labels:How many times have you confronted your boss about it?
text:I never have, I just looked at him like are you for real when he asked me if the guy was sleeping the one day.  I had to bite my tongue not to say, yes, and he does it every day! The seeker sees the boss' boss as not being fair. The supporter should suggest the seeker to set a schedule to address this.	labels:So he must not believe you.
text:Well thank you for letting me get this out.  I appreciate the advice and I will definitely think over talking with my boss.  Have a good night! The seeker feels like she is not being listened to and her boss does not believe her.

text:That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore. The seeker feels hopeless because she is dating someone else. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask a friend and someone who has a good relationship to talk to. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to a therapist about this.	labels:I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?
text:Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late.. The seeker is not sure if she is being romantic or not. The supporter is likely to ask the seeker to set up a date. The supporter could also suggest going to a bar or a private party to celebrate.	labels:Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.
text:I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so? The seeker feels stressed and stressed about the marriage. The supporter should talk to the seeker about how stress can be a huge problem. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should be more confident about her career.	labels:Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life. It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.
text:I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start. The seeker feels like the supporter is using a lot of hyperbole to get at him. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a deep breath and speak to her feelings more.	labels:Start by talking about whats going on.

The seeker is very hesitant about marriage counselling. The supporter could encourage her to talk more about her marriage and how she feels.	labels:I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.
text:If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself. The seeker did not receive any recommendations from the supporter. The supporter could ask her what she wants to talk about. The supporter could also suggest a male or female therapist/counsellor.	labels:Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.
text:I think that sounds like a safer choice. I was also hoping if you have suggestions for me personally. I am quite depressed and I am having problems getting through the day. The seeker is depressed from worries about job situation. The supporter should tell the seeker to start a therapy and figure out the issue. The seeker could also ask the supporter if there is any other issue she might have with her career.	labels:I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can.. If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it. I think it would be a great start.

text:Oh, not too bad - and you? The seeker felt good, but she did not show it. The supporter might suggest the seeker to make some changes to her life and to set up a study group.	labels:I'm doing well. How can I help you today?
text:I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too... But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway. The seeker is feeling frustrated with the cousin's support but is not sure how to go about it. The supporter could ask the seeker to set up tight time schedule or join a study group to get more motivations.	labels:I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?
text:We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical. The seeker feels frustrated because she believes that the support she is receiving is unjust, and knows that she is being critical. The supporter could help the seeker understand that this is normal and that she isn't being critical.	labels:Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?
text:Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though. The seeker did a lot of worry. The supporter could give the seeker some advice on how to be better friends with her cousin.	labels:That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?
text:Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too. The seeker feels threatened by her cousin, and the supporter can tell her feelings. The supporter could also offer to try to talk to her husband or talk to the counselor.	labels:Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?
text:Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say? The seeker feels insecure about her feelings about her aunt. She feels protective of her aunt, but she is too guarded about her feelings. The supporter could remind her that her aunt knows her, and that the answer is simple.	labels:All of the above!
text:Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could add in some stress management or other support.	labels:Do you think these issues are serious enough to get a proffessional involved?
text:Well, she has her therapist. I'm not sure what I could really do. The seeker feels like she is getting advice from a therapist and feels that her situation is serious enough to get her a professional. The supporter could tell the seeker to get a professional therapist.	labels:You may have to make a decision and determine how big her issues are.
text:Yes.... I think talking to our other cousin about her might be a good place to start. The seeker feels guilty about missing work because of the recent tragedy. The supporter could give the seeker the advice that she should not let their guilt get in the way of their work.	labels:Yes. How do you feel about doing that? Do you think that would help?
text:I think it might help... It's one of these things - everyone has so much going on in their own lives... But of course it's also therapeutic to feel like you're helping someone you love. So it might be good for both cousins. All three cousins. The seeker feels like she is helping her cousin. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her cousin. 	labels:I think that sounds like a great thing! Sometimes we just need to get together and help out the people we love going through tough times!
text:Yes, I agree... Well, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for talking to me. The seeker feels some isolation, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could point out that the seeker is unhappy, but she also has support.	labels:Of course! I hope all goes well!

text:Bye-bye! The seeker is ready to go back to her own life. The supporter could tell the seeker that they need to take a few days off and look at the issue. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find a therapist.	labels:Bye!	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you this evening? The seeker feels like she is being ignored. The supporter should ask the seeker to express her concerns. The supporter could also say a few things to describe how the seeker is feeling.	labels:Hello Doing good. How are doing?
text:I've been better. The holidays aren't helping me feel better about not bringing much money home to help pay for things. The seeker has been feeling stressed and anxious. The supporter could suggest to do something to relieve the seeker's anxiety.	labels:Sorry to hear this,have you ever tried selling on Ebay.
text:I've thought about selling stuff online, but the cost of selling things online isn't really worth it. I've been trying to use facebook marketplace, but I never have anyone who's interested. The seeker feels stressed because she is not familiar with the marketplace or Facebook. The supporter could suggest the seeker to start an Ebates group or make a Facebook group on Ebates.	labels:Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.
text:I've heard of QVC, but I've never heard of QVC liquidations. That might be something for me to consider. Can you give me more details about it? The seeker hangs out with the supporter because they want to help her. The supporter can also tell her to call someone to help her get more motivation.	labels:If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id.
text:I see. Is this something that you've done to make money? The seeker is feeling not confident about her job situation. The supporter could explain how she will be able to make money from selling. The supporter could also explain how she can get more motivation from this.	labels:Absolutely.

text:Wow, what sorts of things have you sold? The seeker is feeling nervous about the purchase of netflix, but the supporter could give the seeker some hope.	labels:Go to EBAY and scroll down to the the completed section and click it and this will show you the item your searching like homemade items or stuff like back packs that maybe on sell at Walmart and I buy them and see what they are selling for.
text:Okay, thanks for the suggestions. The seeker is excited about QVC liquidations and wants to know more about the liquidations. The supporter should also mention that the liquidations are a great way to make money, but not something to do exclusively.	labels:I have purchased a lot of stuff from walmart and resold it on EBAY. Its fun.
text:I worked with someone whose boyfriend did that. I've never thought about doing that. I might have to consider doing that so I can feel more helpful to my husband. The seeker is excited to have made some money. The supporter could give the seeker more details about the service. The supporter could also ask the seeker to think about how she could use QVC liquidations to sell the items on sale.	labels:Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper.
text:I don't shop at Walmart very much so thank you for that information. The seeker feels a bit of stress. The supporter could suggest a few things to help the seeker cope with it.	labels:I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.
text:That is very interesting. I wouldn't think you could make that much from small surfboards. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could reassure the seeker that the items will be sold at the end of the year.	labels:He painted them and they looked awesome.
text:I wouldn't think that anyone would want a short surfboard, but I guess I don't know anything about surfing. The seeker has not made any purchases from Walmart. The supporter has not made any purchases from Walmart. The supporter would give the seeker a list of shops she likes to go and visit.	labels:People who own and rent their beach house always looking for some new looks.
text:I suppose you are right. Well thanks for the helpful suggestions to make more money. The seeker is hopeful that the first step will encourage selling on eBay. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seller has been a good person to sell on EBAY.	labels:Your welcome Don't ever give up there is always ways to make a difference.
text:I appreciate your help. Have a good night! The seeker and supporter are cheering up after being told about being a camper. The seeker is nervous about going back to work, but the supporter could give the seeker information about finding work that can help her.	labels:You too.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon/evening. The seeker is friendly and does a greeting. The supporter should also do a greeting.	labels:Hello, how are you tonight?
text:Doing great. How about yourself? The seeker feels good and appears to be doing really well. The supporter could ask the seeker what she has been doing to improve her performance.	labels:I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?
text:So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary.A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2. The seeker felt stressed about her son's work-related issues. The supporter could explain that the son is a big stress for the seeker. The supporter can tell the seeker to find a quiet place to talk or to intentionally get to the issue.	labels:I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?
text:I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol. The seeker feels stuck between a rock and a hard place. The supporter could tell her that she was right. She should ask the seeker if she has a buddy.	labels:I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?
text:It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I dont. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too. The seeker feels frustrated because she is trapped by her job and her husband. The supporter could suggest letting her husband know that she is happy. They can keep in his ear. The supporter could also say, "You are not alone. I am here to help you."	labels:I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?.
text:I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do. The seeker feels frustrated because she is trapped. The supporter can suggest to the seeker to choose to go somewhere where they can talk further.	labels:Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?
text:Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part-time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions? The seeker feels trapped. The supporter could suggest the seeker to delay work for a bit to find a job that pays well. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker to travel to a different country to find work.	labels:We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?
text:That sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I do get paid vacation. The seeker feels stressed and has to talk to her boss. It is important to mention that her boss is not concerned about her work status. She is concerned about how she is interacting with her colleagues. She is stressed because she believes that her job is good at this time. This could be a temporary situation and she could try to change the situation by going to a different job and working part-time.	labels:Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you tonight?\nhanging in there, kinda freaking out a little. The seeker is worried about the exams. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are study groups and study groups are needed to help.

They could also suggest to wait until the next time the seeker compares her situation to others.	labels:Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down..

text:I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me. The seeker feels worried about going to school because of the husband. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek professional help.	labels:I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave.  Do you have a plan in place?
text:I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with. The seeker is worried about her husband and her children. The supporter could suggest to the seeker that she should stay at a shelter, or she could ask her to do some research on domestic violence shelters.	labels:My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.
text:I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying. The seeker has been working on her plan to leave her marriage because she fears losing her job. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to work on her plan.	labels:Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?
text:He hasn't hurt me physically. I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory. The seeker has told the supporter that she is having trouble with her husband and is scared of leaving. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for financial support for moving.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling..
text:I think that's the best idea. The seeker is stressed because of the fear of going to therapy. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to counseling to get more information.	labels:Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious..
text:that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend. The seeker is worried about the situation with her husband. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker consider therapy.	labels:I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet..
text:hey may not realize I'd leave at all. me too, that's making all the difference. The seeker feels stressed and worried about leaving her husband. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to people in the family.	labels:My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that..
text:definitely that makes sense. The seeker says me too, it makes sense because the seeker says me too. 	labels:He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it..
text:I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor. The seeker feels the need to leave the relationship with the supporter. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her mom or see a counselor to make it better.	labels:Ouch! That sounds painful to look at..
text:it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags. The seeker feels like he is being treated unfairly for not being able to work, he is feeling stressed and scared of leaving his job. The supporter could ask the seeker to find help for their issue.	labels:People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.. How long have you been married?
text:eight years, together for 11. The seeker feels trapped and trapped by the marriage. The supporter could talk the seeker into a counselor, or even a therapist. The supporter could talk the seeker to a friend and a counselor.	labels:That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.. Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave..
text:absolutely! definitely no paper trail, for sure. The seeker feels safer after the support by the supporter. The supporter could remind the seeker that no one can keep you safe. The supporter could try to find a friend or coworker who can support her.	labels:I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God..
text:I know that one, it's helping me a lot too. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her husband not wanting to go to counseling. The supporter could tell the seeker the husband is worried about leaving his wife. The supporter could tell the seeker this is a common problem with men in the marriage.	labels:If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.. And I urge you to get a counselor..
text:that's good advice! I will. Thank you. The seeker has gotten upset, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask the seeker to seek out a therapist, a counselor, and a plan to get better.	labels:You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children.
text:definitely, I think I can do that! I feel a lot better! The seeker is worried about worrying, but the friend doesn't suggest counseling. The supporter should suggest counseling, but it needs to be a positive.	labels:It's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it.

The seeker did not want to talk about Martins. The supporter should remind the seeker to let her feelings roll off her back.	labels:I have had old friends do that do me. The best thing to do is let go of them and try to find a better friend. I had a friend that I was friends with for 11 years and she dropped out of the blue. Since then, I have come across a lot of amazing friends..
text:he will never tell you truth. If Martins is seeing red like this in your front , he will tell you is white. mmmmh. The seeker is feeling anxious about Martins and the answer to be truthful.

text:ok. i will do that. thanks. The seeker feels that she is being too careful with her feelings and doing things that she is afraid of. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek professional help.	labels:If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget.  And staying distracted sometimes helped too.  Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps. .
text:ok, thats a good idea. The seeker has been feeling lonely and anxious. The supporter could tell she has been feeling anxious. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is going to be busy and have lots of things to do. The supporter could also tell her that she should try to sleep more because she is so exhausted. The supporter could also give her advice on how to sleep better.	labels:There are also so many articles and support on the internet, don't be afraid to just search "getting over a relationship" or 'bad breakup advice"  there are so many people that have gone through this. Ypu are not alone. I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you. .
text:thanks, i will check them out. thanks for the show of love. The seeker is grateful for the support. The supporter should do the same.	labels:you are welcome.  i hope you feel supported and encouraged.  I know this will get better for you.  take care of and love yourself, friend. you are worth it..
text:i will do that. thanks. The seeker is supported by the supporter's hope that she can get over her breakup. The seeker can tell the supporter that her feelings are really bad, but thats ok. The supporter could say that it is ok to be depressed and sad.	labels:and one last thing that worked for me was when I was really fixated on how perfect my ex was, i'd make a list of why they weren't and why we weren't good together.  It made me think in a more balanced way.
text:really, and it worked? i will try that. The seeker feels a need to find a friend to talk to in order to feel better and feel better about herself. The supporter could help the seeker find a friend to talk to.	labels:yeah, it did work.  even when all could see was how great my ex was i could at least see why we didn't work and i wanted us both to be happy so writing that stuff helped me keep it in perspective.  Its been a privilege listening to you . i'm wishing you all good things.
text:oh, thanks. thanks for the advice. i will work on it. bye. The seeker feels disappointed because she thinks she broke up with her boyfriend. The supporter should tell the seeker something she thinks will help her feel better.	labels:you're welcome. don't be afraid to reach out to others in this time, you are valuable.  i hope you have a good rest of the week. . bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. How can I help you today ?\nWhat should I do. The seeker is feeling stressed, but the reason is not revealed. The supporter should ask the seeker to find therapy.	labels:Tell me about the situation that you are facing.
text:I try to find a job but there is not many. The seeker is stressed by the lack of work. The supporter could try to help by telling the seeker to do some research before applying for jobs.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?
text:About 6 months. The seeker feels bad because of the lack of job opportunities. The supporter should ask the seeker to set up a job application or apply for some place that they can apply to.	labels:I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult..
text:yes. The seeker feels stressed and anxious about job situation. 	labels:I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you.. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family..
text:I don't know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by. The seeker said that it is rough to get by. The supporter should talk about job opportunities and what they are looking for. The supporter can also encourage the seeker to seek therapy and find a counseling firm.	labels:Tell me more about it if you don't mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?
text:I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college. The seeker feels confused about the position she is looking for. The supporter could tell the seeker that being a programmer, she will likely not be able to get a good job. What the supporter could do is ask more questions.	labels:I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?
text:I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too. The seeker is looking for a job. The supporter can tell the seeker that they are not doing a good job of applying for a position. The supporter can suggest some other options.	labels:I understand.

The supporter could add that she is looking for a company that she can work for.	labels:I have been browsing job boards every now and then.

text:The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview. The seeker is hesitant about working for a grocery store. The supporter should say that it is hard for the seeker to find a job because of the unemployment rate. The supporter could ask the seeker to work in a grocery store and see if she is hired.	labels:I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application..
text:Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest. The seeker is feeling stress about her job situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to start working on her job search.	labels:Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies  that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.
text:Do they charge you when you get a job? The seeker receives a job offer from a temp agency. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to apply for a temp agency or other educational opportunity.	labels:I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation.. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire "temp-to-hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers.
text:Thank you, there are no many availability of what I can do and it is just out of control from nowhere. The seeker is concerned about being replaced and the uncertainty of being able to find a permanent job.

text:Not good. The seeker feels anxious about the exams, but the supporter should ask the seeker to do something that she remembers doing with the same anxiety. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to join a study group or one that is doing similar things.	labels:What's wrong, do you feel like sharing?
text:Well, my girlfriend and her grandmother are extremely depressed. The husband of her grandfather is driving everyone nuts with his yelling. Nothing makes him happy. The seeker does not feel happy about her girlfriend and her grandmothers. The supporter could tell the seeker that that the husband and the grandmothers are not happy. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to her friends about her boyfriends and his yelling.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather..
text:Kind of hard when he is the one that owns the houses. Doesn't seem right to leave him. He is going through dementia right now. He always supported them. Just sucks now he is causing so much sadness. He sees me like a son but end of the day. I have to do right by my girlfriend. I love her and her family. The seeker feels stressed about her girlfriend and her family. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should set up study groups or get more motivation to try to overcome the anxiety.	labels:His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side.
text:Yeah. He keeps going to the VA and they keep saying he is losing brain mass. Wish everyone else knew how to deal with him. Doesn't seem like everyone is equipped to deal with this kind of stress. My girlfriend already has enough on her plate with her chronic illness. Mostly the arguing starts when he tells her to eat 'normal' food. Which everyone has to keep reminding can kill her. The seeker feels stressed because she can't just leave the husband of her grandmother to go to the VA. The supporter should suggest that the seeker goes to the VA in order to talk to him. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker goes to a counseling center.	labels:Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?
text:Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution. Not in his current state though... He would lose his mind. He is a veteran... so. He could lose it. The seeker feels stressed and worried about getting a nurse to help her girlfriend. The supporter could suggest a nurse as a way to handle her girlfriend's past. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk about how she feels about having a girlfriend that is obsessed with her.	labels:What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him.
text:He thinks everyone is out to get him. He was in Vietnam for years and left him with guns without ammo to protect a post. So with that in mind... who knows. Could work out. But he has tackled medical personnel before. You could imagine the trauma that encourages that crazy mindset. However, I think I got a good idea what to suggest. At least to my girlfriend and her family. You left I guess. Interesting. Okay. well good bye. Man.. not even a proper good bye. The seeker is happy to see her girlfriend and her family, but the seeker is worried about losing her mind. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her and her family to get their opinion on the matter.	labels:im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk.	episode_done:True

text:Recently  identified in london. The seeker feels good about having identified London in the past. It is a good time to go out, because the supporter could show the seeker how to go out. The supporter could also tell the seeker to check out the London Org.	labels:Hopefully soon cases will be lowered due to the vaccine. How are you feeling about COVID?
text:Is that vaccine will help to control the new variant of corona. The seeker feels negative because of vaccine. The supporter could suggest the seeker to avoid vaccination and go to a doctor to see if there is a vaccine that would help.	labels:I think so. I have my fingers crossed.. How are you feeling during this pandemic?.
text:It was very hectic time for me .Initially we were scared to go to even grocery. Afterwards we are trained our self using safety measures. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to find more information about the vaccine, and why it is effective.	labels:I understand. I have also been on edge during these times, one thing I did do is take all the precautions I could to ease my anxiety..
text:Yeah. That's looking good.  Do u have any idea about side effects of the vaccine, Is it safe for kids? Are you working in frontline? The seeker is scared of side effects of vaccine. The supporter could speak about possible side effects, including a potential increase in depression or migraines. The supporter could clarify that side effects, how they will be handled to avoid the side effects.	labels:I am unsure at the moment. As the weeks continue I am sure we will hear more about the side effects. How are you coping during these times?.
text:I am remotely working. I never go outside unnecessarily. The seeker feels relieved to not be pressured to go outside, but tells the supporter that she does not want to go outside, she is going to stay home.	labels:I am not. Are you? I am very appreciative of those front line workers, I often think about how hard it might be to be in their position.
text:Definitely. The seeker feels stressed and worried about the vaccine. The supporter could suggest a topic to talk about with the seeker.	labels:One thing I do during my time at home (because we spend so much time at home) is to do yoga. It really helps stabilize my mood and be stress free from the virus. There are several of free Youtube that are amazing!.
text:Sure.I am also practicing now a days.Thanks for your valuable time you spend with me.Bit rexation for me. The seeker is stressed because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker that a friend is doing this yoga. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find a friend to do the yoga.	labels:Of course anytime! I wish you the best. On the bright side, everything will hopefully get better soon. Very nice to talk to you as well..
text:Thank you.. The seeker feels happy to hear of the free youtube.	labels:Thank you! Have a great rest of your day..	episode_done:True

text:Yes, me and my partner are considering breaking up as she wants to move to another state to be with her cousin and have a fresh start. I want to stay and be around my family. So that is the dilemma. The seeker feels stressed and worried about breaking up with her partner. The supporter could say that the seeker is stressed because he or she wants to stay and be around his or her family.	labels:So it sounds to me like you're experiencing stress about choosing between staying in your current relationship, or staying close to your family. Do I have that right?
text:Yes and its very hard for me to make a decision on which to choose. The seeker feels stress about the decision, but the supporter could tell the seeker that it is not the right decision. The seeker should also mention that she will be moving out at the end of the year.	labels:I can understand how that feels. Anybody would have a hard time deciding between those options. May I ask you a question about your relationship?
text:Yes, sure. The seeker stated that she is struggling with deciding whether to stay or move. The supporter should see the seeker meeting her family and consider that she is struggling with deciding the best thing for her and her partner.	labels:Compared to other relationships that you've had in the past, how strongly do you feel about this one?
text:I would say compared to every relationship I have had, this is the best relationship I have been in. Plus we have children involved. The seeker felt strong about her relationship with her partner. The supporter could say that it is good to have children involved. The supporter could also ask the seeker to look for professional therapy.	labels:That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision.. Have you talked this out with your family and your partner together?
text:I think that after speaking with you, I realize the choice I must make though difficult. And yes we have talked with everyone close with us or connected. The seeker feels anxious about choosing between staying with family or moving. The supporter could ask for more details about the decision.	labels:How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner?
text:I feel like everyone respected both of our wishes as they were different but everyone also offered advice and shared their experiences. Everyone was cooperative. The seeker was supported by the supporter. The supporter knows that the seeker has a choice to make, but she is being supported by the seeker. In this conversation, the supporter feels supported by the seeker and is concerned about the choice the seeker is making.	labels:So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?
text:Yes we listened to each other but it was still a more agree to disagree conversation. No over talking or arguments. The seeker feels secure about her partner. The supporter could tell her that her partner does have a better chance than her to reach the best decision. The supporter could also tell her that she should consider therapy.	labels:I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not..
text:Yes I have come to understand that we must have those hard conversations rather than avoiding it. Thanks for the talk! The seeker feels comfortable and open about their relationship with her partner because of their roles to the family. The supporter could ask the seeker to share some therapy ideas.	labels:You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.

text:How are you today?\nI'm doing pretty good. The seeker is feeling good about her work situation and has a supportive supporter. The supporter should ask the seeker to set up a study group or something to get more motivation.	labels:I'm glad to hear you're doing well in these trying times.
text:Yah they are very difficult. The seeker is stressing the issues, but the supporter could give the seeker a little perspective. The supporter can close the conversation by asking the seeker to tell the supporter the purpose of their visit.	labels:How have you been managing everything?
text:Fine I've been pretty much just trying to go out as little as possible and stay safe. The seeker feels fine, but the supporter should ask the seeker to stay safe and try to stay away from being around people she doesn't know.	labels:Same here, it's a tough time to do that after doing it so long.

text:Hello. The seeker did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello, how are we doing today?
text:I am alright, how are you doing? The seeker felt okay about the time schedule because it is not urgent. The supporter could give her a date to study and ask her what she needs to do.	labels:I am doing swell. What's on your mind today?
text:I really want to ask how you are doing and what issues you are having, I have done like 5 of these on the supportive side. I have been getting migraines lately which is making my depression worse. The seeker is annoyed that the supporter is not helping her. The supporter should tell the seeker to ask the supporter to share an issue with her. The supporter should also tell the seeker to ask for advice. The supporter could give advice about how to deal with the issues that the seeker is facing.	labels:How long has this depression been looming over you?
text:Pretty much my whole adult life, at least 12 years or so. The seeker feels anxious about the depression. The supporter could ask the seeker to tell the supporter about the depression and how much time she has been suffering from it.	labels:I am sorry to hear that, you mentioned that you have been getting migraines lately though you have been depressed for a longer duration, lets try to pinpoint that cause first.
text:I honestly have a pretty good handle on the depression, lots of therapy. The migraines are making it hard to get anything done though. The seeker feels depressed, but the supporter should try to help the seeker deal with her depression.	labels:Would you say that the migraines are a result of working?
text:I am honestly not sure, I have gotten one in my entire life before and 6 in the last month. I dont think that it is stress related. The seeker feels depressed because of the migraines. The supporter could tell the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:you'd be surprised as how much stress actually does to the mind itself. Has anything in your daily life, in the past month alone, changed that would lead to increased stress that you wouldn't normally experience?
text:Honestly not really, things are going well at work and life is actually going well. The seeker knows that depression is not the cause of her migraines. The supporter could tell the seeker to change the cause of her migraines.	labels:from where I am, most businesses require us to work form home. Is this true for you?
text:No I am stuck going into work, we are essential enough to stay open. The seeker feels stuck, but the supporter could also tell the seeker to tell a story about her family life or something to get her comfort. The supporter could also give a message of resilience.	labels:Ah, I also know some essential workers who must physically attend work. I am lead to believe that the pandemic inadvertently causes a lot of stress in places that we don't commonly associate stress with. For example, wearing a mask everywhere for us in the United States can become a pain sometimes like when I forget it in the car or the house.
text:Yes honestly covid has definitely been exhausting. masks have been mandatory here for quite some time so I am never without one. The seeker felt stress because of work and it has been exhausting. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should find a place to hide if she is working and is not feeling well. The supporter could ask for more details about the chronic stressors she has been having.	labels:I don't blame you, its impossible to keep this composure especially with a pandemic breathing down our necks. When I worked, I found that smaller problems that wouldn't normally phase me began to have a greater effect when the pandemic hit. Thus my stress went up as a result and wearing a mask didn't help the problem.
text:Honestly I wear a mask 8 hours a day and its not a big deal. The seeker says that she wears a mask. The supporter could explain that she wears a mask to keep from getting completely overwhelmed by the pandemic. The supporter could describe that her job is essential and she wears a mask to keep from getting overwhelmed.	labels:Hmm I guess we all deal with the precautionary measure differently. Has your daily routine changed at all in the past month?
text:Not much has changed. The seeker feels stressed, but the reasoning is not mentioned. The supporter should suggest the seeker to find more information or hire more people to help.	labels:are you able to identify any change whatsoever? I ask since any imbalance our body and mind experience is sometimes enough to see a poor reaction, that may lead to things such as migraines.
text:Yes its been surprising, I have talked to my doctor and he suggested I try to document my triggers so I will try to do that. Anyway I have to get going, You have been very helpful. Have a wonderful day! The seeker feels stressed and worried about the uncertainty of the future. The supporter could tell the seeker to be successful in being successful. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is with her boyfriend.	labels:Glad to know my advice is worth something, afterall I am not a doctor. Nice speaking with you!	episode_done:True
text:Hi! What kind of issue are you dealing with today? I would love to help :)\nI am still depressed about losing my job. The seeker was feeling depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to get support from friends and family.	labels:Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that.. What have you been doing since losing your job?
text:It's been rough, it was out of the clear blue. I've been looking for a job, then the pandemic hit. The seeker is depressed, but the supporter should tell the seeker to work on getting new job.	labels:Oh wow I feel you. I have loved ones that have gone through the same thing as you. They were starting to feel super down about themselves. I tried my best to support and encourage them not to give up.
text:Yea, I know, it's not just me. But I do feel alone. I know how they feel. The seeker feels alone because she was in the same situation. The supporter could encourage the seeker to get help.	labels:What industry do you work in? With the pandemic, a lot of interviews are done through Zoom and of course not everyone is at the best through video.
text:I work in the hospitality industry, at a hotel.  Trust me I've been looking, but so far no luck. Since this pandemic, I'm not sure I want to leave the house. How have you loved one dealt with it? The seeker is worried about the pandemic. The supporter could help the seeker by helping her understand the pandemic in other ways.	labels:That's rough :/ I assist in managing some Airbnb properties and they've been hit so hard because of the pandemic. At least there's a light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccine. Honestly I had one friend who had been looking for a job for over a year and he just got an offer last month. They just kept persevering, even if that included applying to 30+ jobs each week.
text:That's good, at least I know there is light at the end of the tunnel. I was thinking at this stage of the game I might have to learn something new in order to get a job. Hopefully, the vaccine will help start to bring things back to normal. Did your friend find a job in the same field? The seeker feels alone because of the pandemic. The supporter should ask the seeker to join a study group to learn from someone else.	labels:My friend works in tech (I don't know what exactly he does since it all goes over my head lol) but I know that he took a lesser position and smaller pay than he had before. He is trying to steer his career in a different direction so I do believe it will work out for him and for you :)
text::) Thanks I needed that. I think I might have to reinvent myself also. For sure the pay will be a lot different, it'll be like starting all over again. The seeker feels pressured to find a job, but does not know which field or position. The supporter could help the seeker by suggesting in which field the seeker can find a job.	labels:No problem :) As long as you keep working at it, I definitely think it will work out for you. Who knows, maybe you'll end up loving this new direction in life!
text:I sure hope so, fingers crossed. Thankfully, I don't have to work much longer, but since I have been working for so long, I do miss it. I think I miss the people more than anything.   . The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I hope you know that you have people who will encourage you every step of the way (even strangers :) )! This pandemic has been really rough but I have to keep reminding myself to count myself lucky for staying healthy. I hope you will be safe until the vaccine and after :) I believe in you!
text:Awww! Thank you I really needed that, you have no idea how much that means to me. A little encouragement goes a long way in these times we are living in. And you are right, I am healthy and I am thankful for that. Eventually, the job will come. The seeker is hopeful that she will reach the job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the job is coming and that she is lucky to stay healthy.	labels:Yes I think people should be more supportive of each other, especially during these times! Just don't ever give up! I'm really glad that I was able to be of help/support today for you :)
text:Yes, we do need each other more than we know . I have to remind myself, it's not just me going through this. Thank you for your kind words.. The seeker has been supported and has received encouragement from the supporter, who is a friend. The supporter is worried about the future of the seeker's job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek professional help.	labels:You're welcome :) I hope you have a Merry Christmas and a great 2021 :)
text:I hope you do as well. Stay Healthy and be careful. Thank you again for your kind words. And 2021 will be better than 2020! . The seeker felt hopeful about the future. The supporter should tell the seeker that she will keep them up-to-date on the news, and how the pandemic is affecting the economy.	labels:Bye! I think you have to end the conversation on your end first..	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker thought that her friend is asking her to join a study group. The supporter should ask the seeker to think about the why behind this question and how she would feel if she were asked to join.	labels:Hi, How are you?

It's been better since I was on medication but I never feel completely....normal. The seeker feels anxious about going to the store, but is not sure if her Panic Attack is caused by the medication. The supporter could ask the seeker to take some precautions.	labels:Another thing that may help is having some headphones in attached to your phone or an MP3 player so you can have some calming music or something in your ear while you are out.

Supporter could suggest that she have some friends to go with her to the store.	labels:I found that distractions were great for me too!
text:I wonder if it should be calming music or music that I generally feel like dancing too. I know that sometimes calming music kinda makes me more centered and aware of myself which can exacerbate the problems sometimes. I usually listen to music loudly when Im in my car to help with the anxiety. Of course, I always think its working then I get to the store and my hands hurt from gripping my steering wheel so hard XD. The seeker feels anxious when she goes to the store. The supporter could suggest the seeker to sit down and relax by taking off her headphones and listening to music.	labels:Whatever music you think would be best would be a good idea.
text:I think a lot of my anxiety doesnt stem from social stuff but from a fear of death tbh. What other distractions can you reccomend? *recommend. The seeker is worried about going to the store. The supporter can tell the seeker to come back tomorrow and visit a friend or a group with help.	labels:Do you have a stress ball or something you can keep with you in your pocket while out?
text:I don't! The seeker feels anxious about death fears because the supporter should mention that. The supporter could also tell the seeker to keep an extra stress ball in her pocket in case of an emergency.

It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct?

text:My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess. The seeker feels the friend is being treated badly because of the situation. The supporter could suggest that the friend be told the situation can be fixed. The supporter could also suggest that the friend be told the situation is of no concern.	labels:That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them..
text:Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better. The seeker feels bad about feeling hurt and upset about her husband. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share similar experiences.

text:Thank you. It gets trying at times. Tonight, I just sit in the dark alone because it isn't worth the hassle. The seeker is upset about being treated badly by her husband. The supporter could question her husband about the situation.	labels:I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.

The seeker feels frustration and discontent with her husband. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is struggling with this. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to set up a time to talk with her husband.	labels:From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.
text:I won't divorce...even if I am miserable, that isn't an option. The seeker feels that the relationship is worthless because of her husband and she is stuck in a marriage. The supporter should explain why the seeker feels this way. The supporter could also let her know that she is not alone in this situation.	labels:I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become..
text:I have gotten used to it. It is the way I am supposed to live my life I guess. The seeker is not concerned about the situation, though the supporter could suggest that the seeker can work out a solution to the situation. The supporter could also talk about the situation with her husband.	labels:Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly..
text:He knows I am miserable. He knows I am upset. He is the living room watching tv and I am in the bedroom. It doesn't bother him that I am upset. It is getting late where I am and I should probably go to bed soon. The seeker explains her husband's actions and is upset. The supporter should tell her husband that she is upset and that he should focus on how to make things better.	labels:Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it. Take a few calming deep breaths and engage in self-care, you deserve it..

The supporter should suggest the seeker to join a study group to get more motivation.	labels:thats understanding. with all thats going on in the world right now its hard to get out and make new friends especially being in a new city.
text:Yes, i wish i had some ideas on maybe some ways I could still make friends. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a make friends guide or to find a new roommate.	labels:is there a way you could connect with people in your area via social media or chatrooms maybe? I know theres this website i used once called meetup where they sometimes organize activities locally to do things even during this pandemic. sometimes they host virtual meetups to.

The seeker was asking for an introvert friend to connect with an extrovert. The supporter could suggest another friend. The supporter could also suggest a sexual relationship.	labels:yea sometimes you gotta give things another go. things can be frustrating at first but it can help to take a step back or breather and think about the situation and how to approach things again.
text:True.  This has certainly been a year of having to take a breather from time to time. The seeker feels sad and lonely, but there is no indication of what the reason is or how to get to the reason. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to start having a conversation with friends or people in her area.	labels:yes it sure has been a challenging year i can relate to that. though i am confident in you that you will get through this and find connections with others.

text:Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well. The seeker feels stressed because friends do not pay for their stuff when they go out to eat. The supporter could suggest the seeker to keep this stress low.	labels:So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out.
text:Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support. The seeker has intense problems with friends not being there for her. The supporter could point out that the seeker is not alone and that the friend may not be as good as he thinks.	labels:I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective.
text:I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same.

text:My grandma mostly who is an experienced family therapist but she is going through her own stuff as well. The seeker feels stressed and the supporter could suggest to the seeker to find professional therapy. If the supporter did not do anything, the supporter should ask the seeker to find therapy.	labels:Another thing that might help is focusing on some of your hobbies, I often find it helpful to use my hobbies to get my mind off of things that are bothering me.
text:That is definitely helpful. I will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. Any hobbies that you do now that really help? The seeker does hobbies. The supporter could also suggest to do something fun with your friends.	labels:I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!
text:Sounds good to me. I will take up building something...maybe turn it into a business as well. Thank you for the advice.. The seeker feels busy and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends about relaxing and not living in fear. The supporter could also ask the seeker to see a therapist.	labels:Not a problem!

You're not alone in feeling this way, but that doesn't change how hard it can be..
text:Sometimes I don't even think the job postings online are even real. And the pandemic has shifted the markets a lot and i don't think my skills are relevent anymore. The seeker has a feeling of being down or feeling like she is not good enough for the position. The supporter could mention the problem is not the job market.	labels:Yeah, sometimes job postings feel fake. In the past, I've found various jobs online. Sometimes it takes a while but if you keeping putting out applications, something good will come your way eventually.
text:Thanks for listening and your kind encouragement. The seeker feels excited about the job market, but is nervous about the job posting. The supporter could ask the seeker to be more confident in her skills.	labels:It sounds like you're worried about your skillset. Is there any way you can improve or learn new things?
text:I was in physical retail before. But now and even after the pandemic will all shift to ecommerce. I am not sure if I can acquire new skills. The seeker feels worried about having new skills. It could be a problem because the supporter could tell the seeker that their skillset, skillset, skillset is not very relevant for this job.	labels:You seem like a bright, open minded person. I think you could learn a lot in a new role. There are many online retailers that could be a great opportunity..
text:My sister works for Amazon and tried to put me forward twice but just no luck. The seeker feels like she has been unsuccessful with applying to Amazon. The supporter could ask if there are any Amazon stores where she could work.	labels:There are still many brick and mortar stores that will open after the pandemic is over, hopefully that will bring opportunity..
text:I tried to stay hopeful. how about you? why did you pick to be a supporter? You are very nice by the way. The seeker feels hopeful because she is excited by the idea of working for Amazon and because of the support. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask the potential employer for more details about the job.	labels:Are you interested in taking any classes to improve your skillset? There are many free courses available online.
text:Yes, I used coursea and also learning French. The seeker feels motivated to learn new things. The supporter could offer her inspiration of new things that might help her. The supporter should offer her advice of what you can offer her.	labels:Thank you, I enjoy talking with people and helping them in any way I can. Wow, learning french must be fun. If you can learn another language, I have faith you can learn new skills for a job. That's really great, good for you!
text:Yes, the Duolingo app is quite good. I worked for a French company for 8 years, just never really get to pick up until now I am unemployed. The seeker feels hopeful with the opportunity to learn another language. The supporter could say the seeker want to learn another language because they wish to improve their skills.	labels:Learning new languages can open up new opportunities for work. It is unique to be bilingual. Make sure to put all your unique attributes, such as learning french, on your resume. It might help!
text:Thats a good suggestion, I can't really hold a conversation in French yet.  But when I do, I would put that into my skillset.  I don't want to fake any skills. The seeker is interested in learning or learning new skills. The supporter could suggest the seeker to read books to practice and talk to a mentor to help.	labels:Are there any other fields of work you are interested in working besides retail?.
text:I know a lot of people do and basically AI are screening all the resume which I don't think I did a very good job in catering to that.  But integrity is very important to me. I am also close to L&D, HR. The seeker is interested in finding jobs in AI. The supporter could ask if she is interested in another profession such as marketing or HR.	labels:I would recommend calling the company or searching for a contact via LinkedIn or just google and trying to make a connection there. LinkedIn has helped me many times in the past when I'm applying for jobs.
text:I am thinking may be I should learn an loan or real estate licenses. Thats wonderful to hear for your great experience. I do use LinkedIn but not much on job applications. . Did you pay for the premium package on LinkedIn? The seeker is interested in helping him or herself. The supporter should ask the seeker to get a loan to help her or himself. The seeker could also ask the supporter to apply for a real estate license.	labels:Earning a license for loans or for real estate sounds like a great way to add to your skillset. No, I do not have the premium package.
text:I didn't want to pay for it either especially I did the trial before and didn't make too much of a difference. The seeker is deemed to be very smart. The supporter can tell the seeker she is smart, but the reason she is smart is not mentioned.	labels:Typically I will search for a company and then look at the employees based on that search. If I see anyone who I have a common connection with or just something similar, I reach out.
text:Great advice, I am a bit shy to do that.  I usually only just reach out if the job listed a HR person contact. But so far I haven't get any reply from these people.   Perhaps they got a lot of messages. The seeker feels shy to use the LinkedIn application. The supporter could suggest to use the LinkedIn application to contact the HR person.	labels:There is also a site called UpWork. I do not have personal experience with it but have heard it's a good way to make a bit of money while unemployed. They have small jobs for people to complete.. Yes that may be the case. Hopefully as the vaccine becomes more widespread, the job market will improve..
text:Yes, I signed up for that too but it was so difficult, most expect you have already earned the "qualifications" in points in order to bind for the job. Yes, will have to stay hopeful.  Super nice talking to you.  Wishing you a wonderful holiday. The seeker has been put in a position of pressure. The supporter could recommend the seeker to try to find a job though and to keep in touch. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to look at other opportunities that involve working in a retail environment.	labels:Thank you, it was very nice chatting with you as well. Stay hopeful, I believe you will find an opportunity. Happy Holidays!

text:I'm qualified for a promotion but my boss is refusing to promote me based on biased feedback he has received from someone else. The seeker had a fair quote from her friend. The supporter should ask the seeker to share with their support group what is going on.	labels:It sounds like you are having a hard time because your boss isn't willing to consider you for a promotion, is that right?
text:Yes that's right. It's frustratgn. *frustrating. The seeker feels stressed because of the rejection from her boss. The supporter could offer the seeker to get a promotion.	labels:Have you talked to anyone else at work about it? I was in a similar situation once, I confided in a co-worker that I trusted and it gave me a different perspective..
text:Unfortunately I can't really talk to anyone at work because there is no one I trust to this extent. Promotions are a bit of a sensitive issue. The seeker has a hard year and her boss is not very supportive towards her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends to find support.	labels:Have you reported to your HR department the issue around biased feedback being used as a determining factor in not being considered?.
text:The HR department favours managers so I am worried that will damage my chances of promotion further. The seeker is worried about HR department and she fears that her boss will use biased feedback on her to not promote her. The supporter could show the seeker that she could have another HR department to report to.	labels:I'm sorry you have to deal with this at work. I think you deserve the promotion because you are very dedicated.
text:Thanks, that's good to hear. The seeker felt stressed because of the biased feedback. The supporter could tell the seeker that HR department gives higher priority to managers.	labels:I think if you continue to advocate for yourself in a positive manner you could possibly increase the chances of being considered for the promotion.
text:It's hard to be positive when I feel like my manager is not receptive to my opinions and just trusts the feedback given by this one other person. The seeker feels lucky to have a manager who is not biased towards her, has a good opinion of her, and supports her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker go to a company where she is committed to her work and go to work every day.	labels:I've worked at a place that seems similar to your work environment. My co-workers were not supportive and I was always overlooked. Eventually, I realized that the environment was toxic and chose to start applying for different jobs. I felt like if my potential couldn't be appreciated then I should go somewhere with opportunities for growth.
text:Maybe it is time for me to start looking elsewhere for better opportunities. I've worked at this place so long that I have become comfortable here and the thought of searching for a new job is intimidating. The seeker is using the negative feedback of the co-worker as a determiner of rejection. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look for another co-worker or apply for another job.	labels:You've got this! It's easy to become comfortable in what we know but, change causes us to grow..
text:Yeah I agree, it's uncomfortable and difficult though! I haven't searched for a new job in so long, I feel like I will perform terribly at the interviews. The seeker is stressed about having a job. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk about the interview process. The supporter could also tell the seeker to look for opportunities outside of work.	labels:Just start slowly and remember that you can be picky about what position you chose. I also think we all feel like we perform badly during interviews. Preparation is key. I hope discussing your work situation today has made you feel a bit better!.
text:It has, thanks for being supportive and listening to my problem. The seeker is upset because she is worried about not being selected for promotion. Her supporter could tell her to look for other opportunities so she can get a job.	labels:It was my pleasure! Thank you for sharing with me. I'm glad I had the opportunity.	episode_done:True
text:Hi! How are you tonight?\nIm ok - tired. Yourself.. The seeker feels tired because the supporter could tell that she is fatigued. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should get some rest.	labels:I'm doing fairly well, Thanks. Can I encourage you or support you in some way?
text:Yes - definitely. I am not sure how to proceed or what to do in my situation. I am exhausted, mentally and physically.. The seeker feels tired and does not know what to do.	labels:You sound as if you are in a slump. I've been there. Perhaps defining the problem and some solutions can help?
text:Perhaps - i dont know the solution. the problem is I cannot continue to work these hours - it is just not sustainable.. The seeker feels exhausted and depressed. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has to take some time to relax, and the seeker can ask for some support that does not involve homework. The seeker could also say that she needs some time off work to have a chance to work through her problems.	labels:What are your hours?
text:like generally, or currently in these situations? usually its around 9-5 (give or take).  These days its 9 - 7 or 11pm or later.. The seeker does not know what to do. The supporter could offer the seeker some ideas to help her.	labels:I have to say, when I am physically and mentally exhausted, I don't think as clearly and lose hope more easily..
text:right, and that is the issue of where I am at.. The seeker states she cannot continue to work what she is doing. The supporter could remind that the seeker has a lot of work to do and the supporter could encourage the seeker to schedule more time in the future.	labels:9 to 11 would exhaust me. That is 14 hours?.
text:yeah - something like that. and lunches are at the desk - as i am working from home - so its pretty much no breaks either.. The seeker is talking to the supporter about her job situation. The supporter should ask if her job situation is stress inducing. The supporter could ask for the seeker to take some time to think about the situation.	labels:I would certainly agree with you. That kind of work is unsustainable. Let me ask you this. What would happen if you told your employer you simply could not do these hours?.
text:hah - i dunno. im on a team of 2 people - and i guess if i dont do it, the other person has to. or it just doesnt get done, and i dont know what happens?? nothing? LOL.. The seeker felt exhausted, but the supporter could suggest the seeker to use a time off.	labels:The worst that could happen is that they fire you. But that doesn't seem too likely as they seem to need you. But I have learned in life that if I don't care for myself, hardly anyone does. We need to be kind to ourselves. Set boundaries..
text:agreed - i dont think they would fire me, maybe get reprimanded or more likely a guilt trip as to why I cant do it. Im just not sure what kind of boundaries I set when we have things due, and just literally no time.. The seeker feels guilty because they feel they are not capable of working more hours. The supporter could tell the seeker to set boundaries and not let their fear get the better of them.	labels:Setting boundaries can be difficult if you haven't done that a lot. When we think we don't have the ability to say NO, then we feel trapped, worn out, depressed, taken advantage of. People need to know that we reasonably can say no.
text:Well, I have to set boundaries, because working till 11pm most nights is not sustainable. and who on earth is going to view, let alone sign a contract at 12am. The seeker feels trapped because she cannot work late on a working day, and the supporter should ask her to have a conversation with her boss before she works late.	labels:I think that would be the first step. Determine how many hours you feel you COULD work. Then advise them that is what you will do. Find out what kind of timelines there are, and if you can't do it, don't go beyond your boundaries. It is obviously destroying your life. It really isn't healthy for you. Exactly. It isn't working for you. Something has to change. And you sound intelligent, so you can determine what will work for you -- perhaps a range of hours, but definitely not 14 hours. Unless you are a young kid. lol Even then, that's a lot..
text:yeah - ill come up with reasonable boundaries till 5:30 is reasonable, and if its a do or die situation cap it at 7:30 --- and thats only for dire situations. if that doesnt work, well then i guess either i dont have a job, or people figure out how to work in regular hours.. The seeker is already feeling stressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look at taking a break. The supporter could also suggest to call her family because they will provide support.	labels:That sounds reasonable to me. And if they try to make you feel guilty, reject that. Tell them, I'm sorry, but I feel this is reasonable, and truly it is.
text:hah i used to go out like a young kid, but still - just because most of us are working from home 24/7, doesnt mean I actually can work 24/7. even fi i were young, hell no. they dont pay me enough.. thanks i really appreciate it. it sounds reasonable, and its what a coworker told me. if i dont set boundaries, i will crack.. The seeker feels guilty, but the supporter should tell the seeker that people will figure it out. The supporter can also tell the seeker that its unrealistic to offer an impossible job.	labels:No one can work 24/7.  I think they may not even be aware you are struggling. So communication is important. . You don't want to crack. It's not worth it. .
text:yeah, i think a call to not just my boss is in order, but also HR to advise them of the situation. they need to start telling managers, we are NOT front of the line workers, nor police, fire, etc. our jobs are not THAT important.. The seeker feels like hell and tired. The supporter could remind the seeker that there are other obstacles that can be overcome. The supporter should tell the seeker that they need to set boundaries, but if they cannot do that, they will not be able to work. The supporter should also tell the seeker that any work at 9-5 is not sustainable. The supporter could also say that they do not believe she will ever be able to work at that time.	labels:I will say a prayer that you communicate your needs politely but firmly. And not believe false guilt. As you said, you aren't putting out fires and doing CPR. .
text:plus netflix, hulu, amazon keep releasing new shows. if i need a reason, it can simply be to watch tv and detox (so to speak) and get away from the BS of work (obv stating it more nicely than that).. The seeker feels pressured by HR and HR rep. The seeker should tell the supporter that she has been pressed by HR, and HR rep needs to let her know that she is pushing her too much.	labels:This has been a stressful year for many of us, you don't need to be working yourself into depression and exhaustion.. You really do not NEED a reason not to work unreasonable hours..

These are the hours, I can't work more.  You don't need to explain that to anyone. But be firm and polite. And you are very welcome. Sometimes we just need a friend! :D.
text:its what i needed to hear from someone who is more anonymous (so to speak). who doesnt have a first hand attachment to me, so its a great assessment.. The seeker feels validated. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is not alone in this situation. The seeker can say it is interesting that she feels validated. The supporter could also say, "I am looking for support in this situation."	labels:I've been in that boat before. It isn't easy, but I learned what I had to do, and I don't get in that boat anymore. And I can see to help others get out.

text:exactly and I'm afraid of losing my license if I don't, I feel like I'm in a bind. The seeker feels stressed that she will not be able to pass the certification program. The supporter could suggest that she think about it and find a way to pass the certification program.	labels:Is there any possibility of postponing this till a later date? For one  thing the world situation is very insecure at the moment and you have the right to say that you just feel that you want to self isolate right now. Are you a member of any sort of union that might be able to liase on your behalf? There are plenty of organisations out there.
text:My biggest fear is that they are bringing in a newer version of the exam which will require a lengthy time that I don't have to prepare, I will be better off taking the current version, I feel overwhelmed. The seeker feels overwhelmed by the exam because it is very expensive. The supporter could tell the seeker to do research on the cost of the exams to get more information.	labels:Okay, well, firstly I think it's a good idea to try to stay calm and not let yourself be overwhelmed.

She can ask the seeker to talk to friends and ask them to support her.	labels:Are they normally understanding of things like this? Do you have a good boss?.
text:yes, I have helped them a couple of times when they are hard pressed on something and needed my help. I'm hoping they reciprocate and bail me out as that's my only hope. The seeker feels secure when she is not alone. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could go to a good support group. The supporter could also suggest the seeker could go to school.

text:You could say that haha I haven't even seen her in 4 years and she's trying to turn my family against me due to an argument we had that long ago. The seeker is angry at family. The supporter could tell the seeker to do something to help the family.	labels:Okay which family member is that that you are talking about?.
text:insecure, narcissistic biological sister who a decade older than me. The seeker is talking about her sister who is older. She is worried that her family will turn against her because she dated her older brother. The supporter could tell the seeker to be more compassionate towards her sister.	labels:I see. Family arguments are unfortunately very common so try not to worry too much about it. Do you really need to keep this person in your life though? If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?.
text:Because I live in the same area as my parents and any get togethers we have I don't even want to go to so I don't have to see her and she has used that opportunity to turn anyone she can against me, I cut off contact back then too...

The supporter could ask the seeker to keep in touch with the friends she has, so the seeker will not feel threatened by the isolation.	labels:I am really sorry to hear this. I was in a similar situation with a family member a couple of years ago. I know how tiring it can be.. Have you talked to any of your other family members about this?.
text:I talk to my mom and one brother about it, the other brother I have unfortunately decided to join in with the behind the scenes trash talk (only because he enjoys drama which she's full of) I never spoke much to the rest of my family anyway (they never could understand me even to a degree we could carry a conversation that isn't small talk jabber) so it's not much of a loss except for what she did today has me kind of P.O.d.

text:Her daughter (who took more after my personality than hers) came into state and had stated she wanted to stay at her grandparents for the first few days but when she came she ended up going to her moms and when she came to the town we live in she had to bring her mom.  Her mom made her to do that for whatever wacky personal issue/emotions she refuses acknowledge and it's a huge bummer because I haven't seen her about 3 years and have small children so I can't really cross country to go visit too easily. The seeker feels frustrated because her daughter wants to stay and is not supportive. The supporter could tell the seeker to speak to friends and share things with them. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get support.	labels:I am sorry to hear this. It sounds like she is being rather toxic. Have you considered getting professional help about this? Would she be prepared to address her issues too?.
text:That's a huge H E double L lolol I don't love her or value her company enough to consider that, no.  IN fact, I kind of want to solve it by beating the living daylights out of her face lol. The seeker says that she is being nasty to her mom about things. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her mom about the problem. But, the supporter can also say that the seeker is being nice simply because she is feeling insecure.	labels:Well I do not think that that would be a good thing to do. That would be putting you in the wrong..
text:Which actually almost happened when we had that silly argument back when but she called our parents and had them intervene and lie for her uuuuuugh. The seeker feels hurt and angry because he feels that he is being treated unfairly by the supporter. The supporter could offer advice about how to deal with this situation.	labels:I think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens. Can you try to just think that she does not exist and not obsess about her?.
text:Yea, she would most definitely call the cops and press charges because she sucks as a human being which is exactly why she's 4 years in my brain still...  Haaalp meh, you have any suggestions for making the lil devil in my brain chill? The seeker feels guilty about her argument with her parents. The supporter would help her avoid further problems by helping her get professional help. In this conversation, the seeker feels guilty about her arguments with her parents because it reminds her of how she is acting to avoid being with her boyfriend.

You have to stay encouraged keep trying, it's easy to give up.
text:Whenever I contact HR they are saying  due to COVID  they are not hiring right now. The seeker is discouraged because of the HR's words.

The supporter should suggest to the seeker that she start looking for a new career.	labels:I recently had to change jobs as well I was very hesitant and not confident about it.

text:Thanks for motivating me. I will try at least.. The seeker did not mention her career, but the supporter can give a suggestion to the seeker. The supporter could ask for the seeker to work on a resume.	labels:It seems that you have a wonderful personality, you just lack a bit of confidence.

text:exactly, I hate to feel that I'm wasting my time. The seeker feels anxious with her boyfriend, but the supporter doesn't say anything. The supporter could try to explain the situation to the seeker.	labels:I completely understand that, as I was in a long term relationship and I felt as though my girlfriend at the time did not want to take things to the next step and I was not happy about it.
text:Yes, I love him so dearly to want to settle down with him, but if he doesn't want that for me I would rather call it quits now than continue and be disappointed at the long run. The seeker says that she feels sorry for herself because she is not willing to take the next step. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should do something to help her. The supporter could also tell her that she should be more comfortable with her feelings.	labels:Have you had that conversation with him? I know it might be a difficult conversation to have, but it is often good to get expectations out in the open so you are on the same page with your partner.
text:Yes, sort of and he gave me the impression that he is not there yet and that was a like almost a year ago, I don't want it to look like I'm pushing him if I try to talk to him again about it. His nonchalant attitude in not seeing the seriousness of it is killing me, I'm just not happy.. The seeker feels that he is not happy with his boyfriends attitude. The supporter could tell him that it is not his fault that he is struggling and try to start a conversation about it.	labels:That is tough, but sometimes people just portray things differently, for instance I am also very laid back and nonchalant about most things which can lead to miscommunications. I don't think it would be pushing if you haven't had that conversation in almost a year.
text:I hope you are right, just don't want to come across as a desperate person and that's why I'm setting myself up to call it quits if he tries to sound like he sounded the last time.. The seeker feels desperate, but the supporter should not expect a call from the seeker. The supporter can tell the seeker that they are not desperate, they are just not sure if they will be able to have a relationship with their boyfriend. The supporter could say something like that the next time the seeker feels desperate.	labels:You need to know where he is so you can make a good decision for yourself! I know it is difficult, but I know you can get through it!
text:You are right, that's exactly what I'm going to do because the wait is killing me.. The seeker feels that she is alone, but the supporter should make sure this is not the case.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a therapist.	labels:I understand people can be cruel and selfish, but not everyone is. Some people want to help! Life is definitely worth living for.
text:Not at all. Why would I want to live in a degenerate world where millions die everyday? Be it hunger, disease, murder... Human beings are disgusting. We should go extinct. The seeker feels like she is selfish because of her family and friends. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and family and ask them to help by giving them tips on coping with stress.	labels:Talking to someone you are close to, like a family member who cares about you, can definitely help. Can you try talking to someone?
text:Family? My family kicked me out of their own house 3 years ago. I am nothing but a burden for them. They would just appreciate if I died. The seeker feels alienated from her family, but does not mention anything else. The supporter could try to ask about the family.	labels:What about close friends, or people you care about? I am sure they would not want to lose you.
text:I have NO ONE that cares about me. Not a single being. Are overdoses painful? The seeker is upset about the death. The supporter could explain the death.	labels:I care.
text:I doubt you do. You are just getting paid to be here. The seeker did not care if they are dying. The supporter should try to be helpful and explain why they care.	labels:Just from chatting with you, I can feel how sad you are about life and maybe a little overwhelmed with what the next step of life is.
text:What would be that next step if I asked you? The seeker feels overwhelmed, but may not have asked for help. The supporter could suggest the seeker to organize a group or attend a talk or talk in an online community.	labels:I used to be really sad about life too.

I believe no one is useless. We were all brought on this earth for a reason..
text:That's a very optimistic view... The seeker is sad, but the supporter can also tell that she does not want to live in a degenerate world. The supporter could say that, "The life of a human is all about caring for each other and having a good time...."	labels:Like I said, I used to be sad too and not optimistic. But now I am optimistic because I know what it is like to be sad, and I don't want others to feel how I have felt in the past..
text:I guess that's a way to view it... The seeker is not optimistic about being sad. The supporter should tell the seeker that it is not necessary to feel sad. The supporter could ask the seeker to think about the surrounding realities.	labels:Have you tried to express your feelings in one way or another? If you don't want to talk to others, there is always other ways - such as writing, music, etc. Have you tried any different ways?. Or would you be open to trying any of those different options?	episode_done:True

The supporter could suggest the seeker to share a horrible story and ask the seeker to support her.	labels:I think it would be okay to allow yourself grieve because in a sense the person you were has now changed due to this event.
text:It is very hard to be in another sexual relationship after that has happened. Im not sure I will every be the same again. The seeker said that the feeling of being raped by her boyfriend has changed her. The supporter should ask the seeker for what has changed her.	labels:I understand, I had a similar event where I was taken advantage of with similar feelings.  I personally decided to share all my feelings with my new partner and we went very slow only doing things I was comfortable with. That may be a strategy you could use to help move back into having a sexual relationship with someone.
text:That seems like a good idea. But, what if my partner doesn't have empathy for those sort of things. Im worried he will not care. The seeker has worries about partner's concern of sexual orientation. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for something about her partner's attitude towards sexual orientation. The supporter could also tell the seeker to try to convince her partner of the sexual orientation.	labels:In good relationships both partners have mutual respect for each which extends into their sexual relationship.  Remember you haven't lost your self worth, and you deserve someone who respects you.
text:I suppose. I just dont want to burden my new relationship with my past issues. The seeker needs to know what is going on with her partner, but he cannot tell her the reason because she is not willing to share her feelings. The supporter should also give her a reason and ask her to talk to her partner.	labels:Your past is definitely not a burden, it's part of you, even if it's not a positive experience.  By sharing your past, it would bring you closer as a couple.
text:I guess you are right. The seeker feels that his past is a burden. It would be nice if the supporter could do something to bring him closer to his new partner. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could ask for some help or a therapist.	labels:Another thing that could help you navigate new relationships is counseling.  I've had counseling sessions that have greatly helped me in the past.
text:I will look into that tomorrow. Thank you for your advice and time. I truly appreciate it. The seeker feels that she did need counseling. The supporter could say that the seeker has been through a lot in her life, but she has come to terms with it. The supporter could also tell her that it is okay to grieve.	labels:Of course!

The supporter could suggest the seeker to find personal therapy or get a massage.	labels:Oh no, I am very sorry to hear about that. Can you tell me more about your situation?
text:I really never got along with my coworkers. I think they purposefully harrass me sometimes. For example, yesterday during lunch time, they took my soda and threw it on the garbage can, then said "oops, I thought it was empty". The seeker feels lonely because they did not get along with coworkers. The supporter could tell the seeker to find therapy.	labels:I'm so sorry to hear that. It sounds like you are being bullied at work. Is that right?

The supporter could tell the seeker that she would be more likely to be harassed by a boss if she works at a place with low pay, or something like that. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should get an internship.	labels:I can definitely understand why that would e so stressful for you. It hurts when your hard work goes unrecognized..
text:I feel like I meet all the standards that are expected from me at work. I don't know what else do they want. Maybe it has to do with my appearance? Do they dislike me because I am obese? The seeker feels bullied because of her appearance. The supporter should ask the seeker to set up a meeting with a good modeling company to showcase the seeker's work.	labels:Have you tried asking your boss for a one on one talk where you can talk about ways you can improve? I did that before and I found that it was super helpful in seeing a new perspective about me. And please don't think you are disliked because you are obese. I can assure you, you are beautiful..
text:No, I haven't tried that. And I appreciate it, but you have no way of assuring that I am beautiful when you haven't seen me. Beautiness is relative too. Maybe I am dislikeable for my coworkers but pretty for someone else. Do you think my boss will react positively to your suggestion? The seeker feels like she is disliked because she is obese. The supporter could tell the seeker that they do not like her because she is fat.	labels:Okay, well maybe that may be a good place to start with your boss? I think it will be a great place to start. Sometimes it helps to reach out and hear other's perspective of you.. What do you think about that suggestion? Are you hesitant about it?
text:I feel like maybe I can give it a try. The seeker thinks about being disliked and the support could tell the seeker to talk to her boss about it. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a really good idea on how to improve.	labels:And I think everyone is beautiful. You are definitely right about beauty being relative. I personally choose to see the beauty in everything and it has made life a lot more beautiful for me..
text:That's a pretty view to have about beauty. Keep it up : ) The seeker feels like she is beautiful. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is beautiful and not to be ashamed of it. The supporter could also suggest she could try giving a presentation to her boss.	labels:That's great! How about your coworkers. Do you feel like it might be worth talking to them about what they have been doing to you?
text:I honestly kind of fear them. I just want them to leave me alone. The seeker feels afraid of coworkers. The supporter could remind the seeker to take care of her hygiene.	labels:I see, I understand how difficult it would feel to talk to people who have been treating you like that. :(	episode_done:True
text:Can you please share what is on your mind?\nHello. I am dissapointed in the teachers that I always get. They seem to make my courses so much harder. I think I just get incredibly unlucky at times. The seeker feels dissapointed. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should look for a better teacher.	labels:I see. You feel unlucky and disappointed that the teachers cause your courses to be challenging?
text:Exactly. I compare myself to my friends and, for example, they get barely any homework. It almost seems unfair. The seeker feels less like a teacher.

The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her friends or family to find out why she is feeling this way.	labels:The first step of a break should be to starting loving thyself. If you get out there and find hobbies you enjoy, who knows, you may find someone that will love you more than you could imagine. Take it from me, I've had this happen.

text:I am 25 at the moment. The seeker asks the supporter if they are older than she is. The supporter should then tell the seeker that it is okay to ask younger people to talk to her.	labels:You still have your whole life ahead of you. Some people don't find a partner until their 40's or even 50's. When I left my ex I found this guy that I truly fell in love with. He is still sulking in his living room. I told him that if he didn't move one that he wouldnt get anywhere in life. I told him that if he cared about me, he would move on because thats truly what I would want him to do and I think thats what your girl would want you to do as well..

The supporter could tell the seeker that she can do better with the break-up.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find therapy.	labels:Has she ever tried to hide text messages, lock her phone, or tell you she is too busy to come over?

The seeker has feelings of not feeling physically attracted to the supporter. The supporter could also ask her to check her phone.	labels:Im sorry that this stressful for you. In my past, I have had exes do that to me. Most likely she was cheating on you and this was the reason for her motives..

The seeker is worried about being alone and feels confused by the supporter. The supporter could tell the seeker that they can't accept their feelings.	labels:I would definitely confront her about it. I wouldn't get angry or fight about it. Maybe she if she has a new boyfriend already. That is a really good indicator.
text:You are right. I need to take this slowly and calmly. The seeker feels stressed about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to tell her about the situation and ask for help.	labels:I would calmly ask her. She will most likely deny it. But, some ofher friends may already know about this. If she says she did, ask her if there was something you did wrongthat made her do it. Sometimes its not even the Cheatee. Sometimes they just do it for no good reason..	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you?\nI'm fine, but could be better just not too happy with my situation. Hope you are doing great. The seeker is so happy with her situation. This supporter could add that the seeker's situation is not perfect, but she is happy with it.	labels:I am well. What's going on?
text:yes, have a friend who I'm very close to , but have noticed she doesn't tell me the truth this days. And not only that she has been distancing as in not calling , always waiting for me to call. I call her about a week ago, but wasn't happy how she dismissed my call within seconds telling me she will call me back only for her not to call till to day. I don 't feel like calling her again. The seeker feels put down because she feels like she needs someone to tell her that she is not good enough. The supporter could tell her that she is not bad enough.	labels:So it seems like you have been noticing some distance between you and a friend and it also seems like he/she is not putting as much as effort into your relationship as you are. It seems at times that you put in all the work and that it's one-sided. Does that sound about right?
text:You are absolutely correct and this is someone I care so much about. The seeker feels distance, but it is not mentioned. The supporter should make sure to ask the seeker to talk to the friend.	labels:This must be very hard on you. How does this make you feel?

The supporter should suggest that the seeker give back a hug or a kiss.	labels:Sixteen years is a long time. I recently when through a similar situation with a friend. In my case, sitting down and communicating how I feel about the situation really did resolve many things. It made me understand why all of a sudden she was being distant and in the long run, it made our bond even stronger.
text:That's very good to hear. I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.. The seeker feels sad because she knows she is being distanced. The supporter could make the seeker think of ways to make things better.	labels:I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.. I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!
text:I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.. The seeker is discussing with her friend that he is "not happy with the situation" and that she is "doing it on purpose". They are talking about how they are experiencing stress and how they are working through that. The supporter could provide an example that shows the seeker can express her feelings and express her concerns.	labels:People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this..
text:Thanks for understanding, I feel better now.  I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on. The seeker feels relieved that she has a friend who is not distancing her. The supporter could say that she is not distancing her because she doesn't want to hurt her feelings. The supporter could discuss how the seeker is feeling better.	labels:I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!

Don't you find life utterly boring and repetitive? The seeker feels depressed because of her fears. The supporter could suggest that the seeker can help herself with a study group.	labels:Just from these few messages, I can tell you are extremely upset about this. I have had problems in the past with depression as well, I used to have severe anxiety as well.

The supporter should let the seeker know that they are going to be feeling sad, but they did not feel depressed.	labels:It was tough. Have you thought about consulting a psychological professional to help with this issue? I did when I was going through my depression and it really helped.
text:NO! I would never do that. I'm already on anti depressants. That didn't help at all. I just don't understand why people like life enough to make more people! It is madness! The seeker feels depressed because of anxiety and depression. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get some help with depression and anxiety.	labels:I didn't like the meds that they gave me either, however I felt that talking to someone helped me a great deal.

The supporter could also suggest that she should talk to her therapist.	labels:It was good to be able to talk to an objective third party about what was going on. It allowed me to get my feelings out without the threat of being judges or harrassed.
text:I understand. Well, I appreciate your time and advice. I just don't feel like you and I are understanding each other very well, though. Anyway, you made your bonus. I appreciate you trying to help me, though. We got to talk for another 4 minutes though. The seeker feels that she has been in a bad mood and is worried about a bonus. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a professional about the bonus.	labels:Have you tried to focus on more of your hobbies in order to get your mind off of things?
text:I used to have more hobbies. Now, I'm not so motivated to do much of anything anymore. I used to play instruments. I like hiking a little, but it is winter now. So... I can't even do that. Plus... I have to travel really far to do that because there is nothing to hike that is very close. The seeker does not find the answer to being motivated to do more activities.

The supporter could answer the seeker how to talk to him more authentically.	labels:Sometimes that is a less offensive way to retrain someone who is being obnoxious or dominant and yet who is easily offended.

But, with distraction, I enjoy them all the more.

The supporter could tell the seeker that there are many options available to her.	labels:I understand that and that was a really brave choice to make before you cornered yourself into a degree that wouldn't benefit your future paths.

The seeker is anxious but not giving a good reason. The supporter could tell that the seeker is struggling and the supporter could ask the seeker to begin finding a good job. It is possible to have good reasons for the seeker to feel anxious.	labels:Refusing to finish something that does not benefit your end goal isn't quitting its merely switching strategies to your personal end goal.

I guess there isn't much I can do about that, though. The seeker feels that she has wasted her time. The supporter could ask the seeker to start and finish the work, or to work on the work and give a commitment to it.	labels:Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up. Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you. Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?
text:I suppose there can be truth in that. I had a friend say that as well, that education is never a wasted effort. I agree sometimes. I should have thought about the program more before I went into it, but ah, oh well. Nothing I can do about it, now. No, it wouldn't be transferable. I have though about doing some grad school for something bio related. I don't know. I'm 30 now and getting burned out, to be honest. Anyway, you've said a lot of nice and helpful things. I don't want to take too much time from you. After all, you won your bonus money. But, I really do appreciate you talking to me. The seeker says that she is getting burned out.

The seeker feels depressed because it is her first year of a new job.

You can't always pick your family. But if they truly make you feel that way you aren't obligated to be there. That's horrible..

text:I have been robbed at gunpoint three times in the past 8 months while walking home from work. Each time, it was one or more black males with guns who robbed me. They would call me racial slurs every time too. Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife. I can't seek help with a professional for my anger issues, because I have committed violent crimes to get even with my oppressors. Are you going to help me?

A few bad instances do not make represent a whole race though. There are also black males who have been robbed and jumped by white people that does not mean all white males are bad. It does seem that you have had alot of unfortunate events with black males. That still does not mean that all black people are bad and why should innocent people pay for things others have done. Do you have to walk home from work or can you drive. Also have you reported any of these events to the police.
text:I walk home because my job is only a mile away. I live in a predominantly black area. The police have taken reports, but candidly admitted to me that nothing would happen as far as arrests because of the current "woke" climate. The seeker feels threatened. The supporter could tell the seeker to not walk home because of the police. The supporter could also tell the seeker that a friend of the victim will walk her home.	labels:I understand have you ever thought about if that black man that raped your wife was just getting even with the white race because his wife or maybe even him was raped repeatedly by white supremists.
text:It upsets me, the way I feel. I do have 2 or 3 black neighbors who are decent people, but thats it. I am the only White person on my street. I am constantly taunted by the blacks in my area. No black woman has been raped by a white man in recent history, even DOJ crime statistics back me up on this one. When is the last time anyone remembers a pack of white men raping a black lady?

The supporter could also think about how the seeker could carry on her life if she moved to another area.	labels:I would suggest for your mental health when the weather is better to move and until then I would avoid areas that can potentially be dangerous and also don't walk home after dark. Also you need to keep seeking council for you anger and racial feelings. I would suggest when you feel very angry to take a deep breath think will your actions help or hurt the situation.  To help with racial issues I would like you to sit and talk to black victims who have been victimized by white people in violent crimes.
text:I appreciate this advice. It does seem good. I just want everything to get better. The seeker felt angry and would not move to a different area. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek someone to talk to.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker stop worrying about being stressed.	labels:This is a strange new world. Sometimes we have to try strange new things to cope.

The seeker feels lonely and stressed, but her support can tell her that she can actually get better by doing things one at a time. The supporter should tell her that there are much easier things to do than sitting in front of a computer while someone else has to work and worry about the fallout from that.	labels:I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same place.
text:That is probably true, but everyone has been so busy that I've only really been communicating with my husband. The seeker is stressed and worried about the financial situation. The supporter should talk to her husband about the situation. The supporter could tell her that she needs to make money and that she should have a job.	labels:And that adds to stress beyond the ad-hoc homeschooling.

text:Hello.\nHello. How are you? The seeker feels happy and keeps smiling. The supporter should ask the seeker to do that.	labels:I am well, how are you/
text:Pretty well at the moment, but not so good overall. The seeker does not feel well. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get help from a teacher or therapist.	labels:What is it that I can help you with?
text:Well, I can't figure out a good strategy to study for my tests. I keep failing. The seeker feels stressed and unsure of what to do. She is worried about her grades and struggling to get through the exams. The supporter could tell the seeker that they want to help with the exams.	labels:What tests are you struggling with?
text:Mainly, the ones that require memorization, subjects like political science, government, history, economics, biology. I don't really struggle with physics or math because it's more whether you can do the thing or not. The seeker feels stressed, but the supporter could suggest that the seeker is struggling with these subjects because of the tests. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should join study groups.	labels:So from what I understand, you are struggling with study strategies to help you pass your tests?
text:that is correct. The seeker did not need to thank the supporter. The supporter should give the seeker a hug.	labels:I am in school as well and I struggle with ways to study for tests as well. Are there any online study groups that you could join for these classes? I found it is very helpful to study with other students who are struggling in the same way I am.
text:Well, yeas, that was kind of working for me for a while, but now corona hit us, and all the classes are online. So group studying is no longer as efffective. Do you have any other methods of overcoming it, that you are willing to share? The seeker is feeling stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to think about what the reason is for the upset.	labels:Have you thought about connecting through zoom, or google meet? Video conferencing has become very popular since COVID began.
text:Yes, I could. It brings its own complications but it should be fine.. The seeker feels stressed that they have to study for exams. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to set up a group that meets when they need to study and to make sure that they get a lot of motivation.	labels:It definitely takes some getting used to, but after you get used to it, it is a great tool@
text:Thank you for the advice. The seeker is worried about the way to study. The supporter should ask the seeker to think about the student learning strategies and be mindful of what she or he is doing. The supporter can also ask the seeker how she or he can improve the study.	labels:No problem! I know school is incredibly difficult, but I know you can get through this!	episode_done:True

text:No just keeping motivated.  I sell wreaths but I'm switching more to tumblers (just easier storage wise). The seeker feels stressed and has trouble with the financial issues at this time. The supporter should also ask the seeker to check on her current finances and see if she is making enough money.	labels:Well it's great that you've got a business venture! Do you have experience with this sort of thing?.
text:I have sold wreaths for awhile but I did not have time to be as serious so I did not sell a ton.  Now it's time to kick it up and get tings moving.  Be more serious about it. The seeker is excited about selling wreaths. The supporter could tell that the seeker enjoys selling wreaths. The supporter could also say that she likes to get involved with the community.	labels:That sounds like an excellent idea to me! I think that you are definitely doing the right thing.. Have you looked into organisations that might help small business owners like yourself? There are some out there.
text:I need more motivation, time and energy. I have not but that's a good idea. The seeker has not found a qualified service provider, but she does have money to pay for therapy. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a qualified therapist. The supporter could also suggest some networking opportunities.	labels:Alas I think that we all do at the moment - I am struggling myself to find those things..
text:I feel like I need more hands/arms too.  If I was like an octopus I'd be good lol. The seeker feels stressed and anxious because it feels like she is too small. The supporter could suggest to start small and change your environment.	labels:LOL so you feel like you just don't have enough help to complete all your orders? Could you hire an assistant?.	episode_done:True
text:Good evening.\nhello. The seeker is happy to meet the supporter. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a really good friend who is really nice. In this conversation, the seeker is happy to meet the supporter. The supporter could suggest that the seeker go home and have dinner with her friend.	labels:How are you this evening?

The supporter could suggest the seeker to look for professional help and get some advice on how to manage it.	labels:Are you someone who has immune issues?
text:I am also facing the real possibility of surgery which scares the heck out of me. I am! I have a severe auto immune disease called Ulcerative Colitis, and I am on immuno suppresant meds on top of that. The seeker has an autoimmune disease and the supporter could tell her that it is scary. The supporter should also offer to help her with immunosuppression.	labels:Just to clarify, you are extremely anxious about the pandemic and the affect it may have on you because of your weakened immune system.
text:Well  kind of yes. I am going crazy because I've had this for 8 years now and it's forever changing. I've been hospitalized so many times its crazy. This pandemic has made things worse because stress makes it all worse. The seeker is stress-oriented because of the fear of the upcoming exams and the fear of surgery. The supporter could point out that he or she has a lot of work to do to prepare for that event.	labels:Just from the few messages we have exchanged, I can tell it makes you very anxious.
text:Its just really depressing not knowing what to expect next. Its hard to trust the good days sometimes because you can have a wonderful day and wake up really sick the next. Its very unpredictable and I think whats worse is that people really don't understand. The seeker feels extremely anxious about the lack of news about the pandemic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have more information about the pandemic.	labels:Have you reached out to support groups for people with auto-immune issues? it is often helpful to speak with people who are experiencing the same issues you are.
text:Yes I am part of many on facebook, and yes it does help a lot. I just wish my husband would be able to understand. He says and does some things that make me feel even worse. Almost like he thinks I'm making it up at times. Like, dear goodness no. The seeker feels the anxiety is making her feel even worse. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a new job and start a family, or find a new boyfriend. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to start having sex with more people.	labels:Have you talked to him about the way he reacts to your immune issues? Sometimes people don't realize they are not being helpful and they think they are doing good when they aren't.
text:I have tried to talk to him but he seems very uninterested at times. I even tried going to counseling with him and that didn't work. It's just frustrating. He was with me when the one doctor had said just how bad it was and he didn't seem to really pay attention. He was also there when I had to have an emergancy blood transfusion and it was really hard to read him. He just doesnt say or so much. The seeker has been told that her husband is uninterested when she tells him about her auto immune disease. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her husband and explain what she is going through. She should also ask her husband to try and change his position.	labels:Have you asked what his feelings are towards it? Maybe he is afraid and worried about your health and he isn't sure how to express it and sometimes it comes off as uninterested.
text:Yeah whenever I try it's like pulling teeth. I know some of it is how he was brought up. I don't think his dad ever showed much emotion/ so yes I'm sure that has something to do with it. I also feel bad a lot of the time because I have two kids. I feel like I fail them a lot. our oldest was born before I got sick. Our youngest was a miracle baby. I was on birth control and he was determained anyway :) He is definatly a gift but I feel bad often. The seeker feels bad when she says her husband and her two kids are doing well because they are not feeling well. The supporter can tell the seeker that she has a bad day because she is feeling bad.	labels:Have you been able to talk to your kids about this as well?
text:My oldest yes, he seems to understand, he is 8.5 years old. Our youngest is only one so he doesn't understand any of this yet. He says he understands, but I'm not sure on just what level. The seeker feels sad and worried about her kids because she feels like she failes them. The supporter could help the seeker by taking care of her kids.	labels:Yea, with young kids it is hard to tell sometimes. I know this is extremely hard, but I know you can make it through this!	episode_done:True

The supporter could tell the seeker to work on anger and anxiety, then suggest some support.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that. Did she give you reasons why she wants a divorce?
text:I want to work on the marriage.  She doesn't even want to talk. She found someone else. I'm not even sure why she was looking. She shouldnt of been talking to anyone like that. The seeker is angry, but the supporter should ask the seeker to talk to her husband and family.	labels:Just from the few messages we have exchanged I can tell you are very upset about this.
text:I am so upset.  I can't eat, I can't sleep.  I can hardly get up and function. The seeker feels upset because she is not able to eat, sleep and function. The supporter could remind the seeker to talk to a professional therapist.	labels:I completely understand, my ex-wife also found someone else while we were married and decided she wanted a divorce.
text:I don't understand why people even get married if they are going to look for someone else. We could of just staid dating. The seeker feels frustrated about marriage and divorce, but it is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to a marriage counselor or a social worker to help the seeker with some issues.	labels:Have you asked her about why she started looking for someone else? Sometimes it helps to get some closure and understand the reasons why.
text:She won't talk to me.  I am out of state (back home with family).  She told me when I was up here.  She blocked me on everything.  This new person is already living with her or staying there all the time.  When I call this other person answers her phone and talks trash.  She won't let me talk to my wife at all. And obviously my wife does not attempt to talk to me. The seeker feels frustrated about being out of state. The supporter could provide more information about why she was out of state.	labels:Have you reached out to others who have been through this situation? It also helps to be able to talk to people who have been through the same things as us.
text:I have joined some facebook groups with other that were cheated on while married. The seeker feels called upon to talk about her cheating experiences. The supporter could explain the reasons for the seeker to stay married, but not to discuss her cheating experience.	labels:That is definitely a good start! What are some hobbies you enjoy?
text:I use to love to craft and sell stuff on Etsy.  Since this has all gone on I have a hard time doing any of it. The seeker is angry about the husband cheating on her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to be angry with her husband but not to throw in the towel. The supporter could also suggest that she ask her husband about the reasons for the cheating.	labels:I would definitely get back into that stuff too! It helps to distract yourself with things you enjoy!
text:I am trying.  I try to listen to music too but every song reminds me of her. The seeker is trying to listen to music and is frustrated. The supporter could also try to help the seeker by using good music, as long as it is good for the seeker.	labels:I had that problem as well, but doing things I enjoyed definitely helped to get my mid off of my ex-wife leaving.
text:I have to listen to music that I did not with her...which is limited. The seeker is distracted by listening to music. The supporter could suggest the seeker to listen to the music that is on her phone and try to distract herself from the anxiety.	labels:I know this is extremely hard, but I know you can get through this!
text:I wish I knew what the secret was to just not love her anymore. The seeker feels that the music is distracting her from her ex-wife.	labels:I can understand that. Try and find new music, maybe something you haven't listened to before!
text:I feel like she shut off her feelings for me.  I wish I knew how to do the same. The seeker is frustrated because she is going through a lot of heartache and she does not know how to handle that. The supporter should ask the seeker to find some more inspiration.	labels:I had a really difficult time with that as well, I just tried to make sure I stuck with my hobbies and distract myself.
text:I keep trying to distract myself.  It's so much easier to lay in bed and do nothing. The seeker feels confused about her ex-wife and her new partner. The supporter could tell the seeker not to focus on her ex-wife and move on with her life.	labels:What other things do you like to do for fun?
text:I don't even know anymore I feel like I need to find new hobbies. The seeker feels lonely since she is trying to find new hobbies. The supporter could tell her the seeker can attempt to find new hobbies and that she could use some new music. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a new hobby.	labels:I think finding new hobbies would be good. Try new things, things you haven't done before.
text:I will do taht. The seeker feels like she has to do something and is distracted from something. The supporter could tell the seeker to find other things to do with her time.	labels:I think it will definitely help.
text:Well it was nice talking to you. Thanks for listening. The seeker feels reassured after talking to the supporter. The supporter should also be happy with the outcome and congratulate the seeker.	labels:Not a problem! Feel free to chat again if you need it1.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing right now?\nHI! Not good.  I'm sad right now.  I'm mad and angry all together. The seeker feels guilty and angry. The supporter could tell the seeker to stop being so angry at her boyfriend or to talk to friends. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she has the support of her friends and family.	labels:So you are not having a good time at the moment? Can you tell me a little more about why?.
text:No I'm not having a good time at all.  I am so mad at my wife for cheating and not giving our marriage a second chance. The seeker feels frustrated with her spouse and cheating. The supporter could mention some ways to get over the frustration.	labels:Your wife has been unfaithful to you? I can understand why you are so angry about that!. Have the two of you considered counselling or are things beyond redemption now?.
text:Yes she has been unfaithful.  I think this person she is with is living with her now or staying there (I'm back in my home state now) The seeker is having a hard time with her husband. The supporter could recommend the seeker to talk to friends and get counselling.	labels:I am really sorry to hear that. I do know personally how betrayed you feel when you are cheated on. All I can say is, it does get better..
text:I would love to try counseling.  She won't even talk to me.  I came back home to stay with my family for a few weeks.  She called and said it's all over.  I found out she has someone else. I have been miserable. The seeker feels betrayed by the spouse who cheated. The supporter could speak to her issues and try to explain them to her.	labels:It sounds like you have been treated very poorly, do you agree with that?.
text:Yes I have and everyone says to move on.  I just don't know how to let her go in my head and heart. If she called me today and said come back I probably would go.  I know I'm weak.  I just love her. The seeker feels betrayed and angry, but she does not know how to move on. The supporter could tell the seeker she is weak and that would be a good thing to do.	labels:Are there potential financial issues or do you think she'd be prepared to reach an amicable settlement?.
text:No we just got married earlier this year.  We never even got around to putting our finances together.  So I'm good there.  Thank goodness. The seeker feels that she is being treated badly. The supporter could say that the seeker has been financially well enough to put together a settlement.	labels:She does not seem to have stayed true to her marriage vows for very long!.
text:No and it shocks me because she was so against not getting a divorce.  We think (her bff and sister) that she may be using drugs. The seeker has been cheated on by her bf and sister. The supporter should ask the seeker to reach an amicable settlement with her bf.	labels:Wow that is very difficult. There are support agencies out there that can help the friends and family of addicts, I believe. Would you consider them?.
text:I would.  She won't even talk to me though.  When I try to call and talk to her this other woman (the lady she's cheating on me with) answers her phone and will not let me talk to her. The seeker is still angry and in a bad mood. The supporter should try to talk with her. Why would she do that?	labels:That sounds really very controlling. Do you think that maybe she is regretting her decision but does not know what to do about it?.
text:She could be (at least I hope she is) but if she is there's no sign of that.  She has never said or showed it. The seeker feels so anxious, anxious and guilty and also feels guilty. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to family or friends and see if they can help. The supporter should mention that she has been in a relationship with a woman and her husband. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to her family to get details.	labels:Sometimes, unfortunately, you do just have to walk away from a mess if there's nothing you can do about it.
text:I know.  I'm struggling with letting go of her.  It's like my brain is consumed with the thoughts.  I want to let her go.  I just love her so much.  I would of never married her if I wasn't in it till the end. The seeker feels betrayed and hurt by her wife. The supporter should ask the seeker if the situation was not right and what do you think is the reason of the feeling.	labels:I hear you on that. Unfortunately some people do not take commitment as seriously as others. I have been in that position and had my heart broken..
text:Yes I agree with that.  How did you get over it? I feel like she just turned her feelings for me off.  She blocked me on all social media and my number.  Then again I'm sure the potential drugs could help with her turning her feelings off. The seeker did not learn about the person she is cheating on. The supporter should now go out and find someone else to speak with.	labels:Oh, I tracked him down and smashed his head in with an axe. Okay no I didn't really. I just told myself that I was better off without him and it was his loss. I am not sure I totally believed myself though.. (sorry I had a temporary internet connection problem there).
text:I keep trying to tell myself that but I don't really believe it either. . It's ok. I think it just takes time.  I am talking to someone that understands and wants to pursue me.  But I can't let the wife go in my heart/head. The seeker is talking to someone that understands her feelings. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to someone she knows in the area of support. The supporter could also message the seeker or talk to her friend/family to help her reach out to someone who understands.	labels:I would advise not to rush into anything else too quickly.. You need to give yourself time to grieve before you move on.
text:This person is ready and this person knows all about how I feel about my wife.  I'm not going to rush into it but it is nice having someone that wants to be with you. The seeker feels ready to move on, but the supporter should suggest that she should stop talking to her husband to get her feelings of wanting to be with her husband.	labels:I hope that I have been able to be of some comfort to you!.
text:Yes it's nice having someone to chat with.  Hope you have a nice evening. The seeker is happy to have someone to talk to. The supporter could suggest to do a Skype date and ask the seeker to go to a restaurant with the supporter.	labels:And you too! Goodbye :).	episode_done:True
text:Hi. I’m feeling really depressed lately. The seeker feels depressed because of the stress and there is no indication of what will help. The supporter should ask the seeker what she wants to improve.	labels:I'm sorry to hear this. Is there something specifically bothering you?
text:I just feel like no one I work with really likes me or cares about me. The seeker feels depressed because of the lack of support. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a better career.	labels:You don't think people like you or care about you at work? What specifically have they done to make you think this?
text:I just feel like no one talks to me and if I try and talk to them they are very dismissive. The seeker feels depressed because no one refers to her as a friend. The supporter can suggest she to set up new work relationships.	labels:I can understand that might make you feel uncomfortable..
text:I feel like I go out of my way to help people and I remember their birthdays and I try and be nice to them but no one ever does the same for me. The seeker feels anxious about getting a job because of the culture. The supporter can suggest the seeker to talk to people who are in the same situation as her. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to try and get a job.	labels:I have been in many work situations and even social situations where I did not feel as if I fit in, I'm rather an unusual person. I had to learn to not focus so much on BEING accepted. I had to learn what God think of me (he loves me) and try to be kind to all I meet, other centered. That is, I also had to make sure I wasn't being rude or mean.. I can understand how hurtful that is. Our society isn't as kind as it once was. I find very few people appreciate kindness. However, I can't get caught up in that, it's the way people are. It isn't a reflection of myself. I think it is the hardest thing to be more concerned with others than we are with ourselves, it can be lonely..
text:I think from now on I’m just going to focus on myself and my family, I’m not gonna out of my way to be nice to my coworkers, I’m just going to treat them as coworkers not as friends and just keep to myself. The seeker has been feeling lonely because of her coworkers. The supporter could tell the seeker that is why she is feeling so lonely. The supporter could also say that a friend would be nice to the seeker. The supporter could also say that she would rather have a friend than a coworker.	labels:I think you can be kind to them, but I think perhaps your expectations are that they reciprocate, and they aren't which hurts. Perhaps be kind without expecting anything in return, and know that God sees your kindness.
text:I always feel like you have to be a friend to have friends, but I’m tired of being the only one putting effort in and getting taken advantage of. The seeker feels tired because he did not receive the support he needs to get out of the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to set up those goals, and set a goal to help.	labels:I also had this happen, I had no friends and at first I thought it was me, then I realized it was an opportunity for personal growth. Which wasn't easy.. How do you feel they take advantage? Being ignored is one thing, having someone take advantage of you is a different story..
text:I just feel like they just expect me to do things for them now and when I do it, it’s no appreciated because they just know I will do it. The seeker feels lonely and anxious about being ignored by her coworkers. The supporter could give the seeker a lesson on how to be kind to her coworkers. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to her friends and share their experiences.	labels:I understand. Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?.
text:Yeah, I’m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries. The seeker feels lonely because she doesn't have anyone to say no to. The supporter should tell the seeker to be aware of the limitations of her relationships.	labels:I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes.  Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense.  Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first..
text:Thank you! You have been very helpful. I think that will be my goal! Start learning to say no and don’t feel guilty about it. I think I am going to lower my expectations from other people and just start treating people as they treat me! The seeker feels guilty about being ignored, but does not want to be treated like a friend. The supporter could ask the seeker to seek therapy and ask her to be kind to others.	labels:If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I  do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom. I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before God one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you CAN be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :D. I suggest a book called "Bounderies" one of the authors is Townsend -- great book.
text:I think I just need to learn a new approach to how I handle my dealings with other people.. The seeker is feeling uncomfortable being with people, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to sit down and talk to a friend. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to someone else, but the supporter should not discourage the seeker from trying to do the same.	labels:Might be on youtube too. Good stuff on how to say no and set boundaries! :D. I think you have identified your problem and looked at it and you seem intelligent and caring! I'm sure you will be able to figure this out. You seem like a  nice person to me, and I just met you. You seem emotionally mature, able to discuss your problems and think about it in a mature way.. A lot of people will just blame others and not change. We can't change others, we can only change ourselves. That's the hard part but recognizing we can change and must is so important!
text:Thanks for your help. The seeker has identified her problem and asked the supporter to talk to someone else about it. The supporter should tell the seeker that they will talk to someone else instead.	labels:You are welcome! Have a nice evening!.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there, how is life treating you at the moment?.\nNot too bad outside of work.  I'm miserable there. . The seeker is not stressed. The supporter could suggest to give the seeker some advice about stress management.	labels:So you are experiencing problems at work? Please tell me about it, I am happy to listen..
text:Things have changed and my new supervisor has crushed my spirit by taking all the parts I love away.  She never liked me and now she gets to make me suffer. The seeker is unhappy with her current situation, but the supporter could ask to talk to her supervisor.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that - trouble with workmates, especially those who are in a higher position, can make things very miserable can't they?.
text:They really can.  I used to love my job and my team.  Now she has made everyone miserable because she just doesn't care about learning the job or the job at all.  My morale is low and worse because I can't help my peers who are struggling as well. . The seeker feels hopeless because she thinks she is doing well at work. The supporter could ask the seeker to think about her work mates. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to have a team.	labels:Have you considered going over her head and putting in a complaint? Especially if she is making everyone else miserable as well. Someone more senior might be able to do something..
text:I have considered this many times.  Unfortunately, the next level manager doesn't respect or value my team in general.  She has made that clear.  She's also just awful and uncomfortable to talk to.  I've found her to just be mean sometimes.  It just feels so hopeless.  Just waiting for someone to notice.  Just hoping she fails.. It's just really hard to show up everyday.  But I do.  Although the days are long and exhausting with no motivation to perform. . The seeker feels hopeless and frustrated. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look at the next level manager and see if they would do something to get the seeker motivated.	labels:Please try to stay positive - bullies never prosper in the long term. I think that you need to talk to your co-workers about this and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement between you. Alternatively, have you ever considered seeking another job? I know that that might feel like selling out but you might be happier somewhere else.
text:You are right.  She is a bully.  I have called her several names to myself, but not a bully yet.  My coworkers and I have discussed what options we may have.  My suggestion was that we work at our normal pace rather than scrambling to make up for her failures.  I wouldn't want to set her up, but I think her failing is the only way we will ever see a solution.. I have applied for another job within my company.  There seems to be interest in me, so that's exciting.  It is a job I really want.  But then, of course, I feel bad about leaving my peers behind.  I really care about them. . The seeker has found a solution. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker find a job in her field.	labels:I feel that that is fair enough.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker take time to make some homemade gifts for her kids. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker go for individualized gifts for each child.	labels:I know it can be really hard to feel like you can't make anything worthwhile, but I'm sure theres something you could come up with that could still put a smile on your kids faces.
text:Do you have any craft ideas? The seeker feels overwhelmed and stressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a craft project that can help her feel more productive.	labels:Maybe you could look at involving your kids in the process. The feeling of doing something together as a family can make it way more fun. It could be a shared experience your family can look back on fondly later on.
text:That's a good idea. I would like to have it done before christmas. How about some wooden toys or a cardboard box fort? The seeker did take part in the process of creating something for the child. The supporter could teach the seeker to see the child as a child, and involve children in the process. The supporter could also teach the seeker to appreciate the children's ability to create. The supporter could also mention what a good time the seeker had with the children.	labels:I have seen some people make small ornaments filled with candies and treats and other small goodies. So even if all of the gifts feel small, they can feel like they are getting a lot of them. And you could even get them to have fun decorating and painting the ornaments! Yeah, a box fort is really fun!
text:I never that about filling an ornament with small stuff. That's a great idea. The seeker was confused, but the supporter should help the seeker by telling her she could have a box fort filled with something that would be fun.	labels:When I was a kid, I loved making box forts, and its a great way to reuse stuff you might already have around the house. The fun pretend games you can play were a blast. I'm sure your kids might love it too!
text:I could paint and decorate it. My daughters would like that. I can make it look like a castle. The seeker feels like she is going to get a lot of what she wants from Santa. The supporter could ask the seeker to put together a box fort so it can be both a box fort and a toy fort.	labels:It can feel tough when it feels like you can't provide all the big gifts that you feel your kids deserve. But you clearly care and love your kids, and want to do something for them.
text:I do. this has been very helpful. It's not all hopeless. The seeker feels good about the date, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:Last Christmas when I gave gifts to my family, one of them later told me that the gift they loved the most was the box of Christmas cookies that they were able to enjoy over the course of the week afterwards, and not the keyboard I had gotten them. Sometimes it doesn't take something expensive to be meaningful and make someone happy.
text:That sounds wonderful. I'm getting to work on my projects. Thank you. The seeker feels that he is able to provide for his kids. The supporter could ask the seeker to make some homemade treats or a wooden box fort.	labels:I'm really glad to hear that. It still might feel tough, but truly things are not hopeless.	episode_done:True
text:I am so stressed. The seeker is stressed because it was painful to work and working full time.

In this discussion, the supporter could suggest the seeker to find a mentor.	labels:Hi, what's going on?
text:I have a college course in the evening, but I cannot concentrate while distance learning. I am expected to watch the instructor do excel on a tiny phone screen and follow along. The seeker feels stressed because of the distance learning experience. The supporter could tell the seeker to get more ideas to do her course.	labels:Oooff that sounds brutal... especially the excel part! do you have a bigger screen you can use?
text:It is stressful. I am able to pull up zoom on my laptop, but it is almost more cumbersome because I must switch back and forth. I have to also manipulate an excel as well as watch the instructor. My colleagues in the class are annoying, because they do not know how to use mute correctly. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Do you have access to a second screen or have the ability to stream the class on your tv through chromecast or something?.
text:I don't have a second screen, but I do have a large TV. I may be able to hook it up via HDMI. The seeker is stressed, but the supporter can give a benefit of the doubt to the seeker. The supporter could tell the seeker that they are there to help her and give her the opportunity to speak. The supporter could also describe how they are not an expert in that field.	labels:The mute thing is horrible. I have no ideas for that. hahah. I'm looking for help with that too! Yeah try the HDMI hook up you can sometimes find cheap attachements on amazon if you don't have the right connections..
text:Sometimes I get really anxious. My ears will be pounding and I feel like I can't hear anything. It is worse when using in ears, because it's like all I can hear is my heartbeat. The seeker feels anxious about the headphones and the earphones. The supporter could suggest the seeker to listen to speakers or an audio interface.	labels:yeah if you stream it on your tv, you won't have to wear headphones... that way you can control the volume better too..
text:That sounds like a great idea. Have you had any weird technological solutions to help you through distance learning? The seeker seems stressed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a remote control or a remote controlled tv.	labels:I'm not really doing any distance learning right now. Just working  from home and coincidentally most of my work uses excel. I have constant virtual meetings where I have to show people things via excel. It's pretty tough but I found if I use multiple monitors it makes things easier..
text:I have considered making impulse buys to help with some things. Do you know about portable second monitor screens for laptops? It seems almost like a thin tablet that you plug in to your laptop. I like the idea. The seeker is anxious about having to use headphones. The supporter could tell the seeker that he/she can be a little better at using headphones. The supporter could also suggest to try a different headset and/or a different distance learning program.	labels:my second monitor is not portable. I don't know if that would work for me because I work better in one designated spot. So I have 3 monitors on my desk (2 separate monitors and my laptop screen). however something like That would definitely be something I'd look into if I was in school or taking classes.
text:I enjoy portability and minimalism to a fault sometimes. I enjoy being able to work from anywhere. Do you live in an apartment or home? The seeker feels comfortable when being able to work from anywhere. The supporter could suggest the seeker to work from home or a home that has a wage.	labels:I think that's a good call! Do you think you can find a deal somewhere on it?.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you? Anyone there?\nHi how are you? The seeker does not know what the supporter is saying. The supporter could tell the seeker to have a conversation with her friends or ask her to talk to her family.	labels:Hi! so nice to chat with you today.

The supporter could suggest that there are people around her that are doing something to ease her loneliness. The supporter could also say that the seeker should read some of the good books to help her get more motivated.	labels:I have also done that as well, though I do miss the human to human connection. I have learn how to knit, hot make bread ( yes! bread lol), and got out of my comfort zone and watched different genres of movies along with books. I am a creature of habit with set routine, I really tried to get out of my bubble as much as I can. Keeping my mind busy makes the days go by faster. have you tried to do something new and challenging? how to make**
text:I saw that bread trend earlier in the pandemic. How did you do? I am thinking about going to the park... The seeker is looking forward to going to the park because she feels that going out to the park is a great activity. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could go to the park and be out with friends and the supporter could ask the seeker to buy a hot meal.	labels:well I can tell you, the first 3 times I tried to make 'regular bread' it was a disaster. my bread came out hard as a rock. I kept working at it. You are truly involved when making bread. Cool! I did not know it was a trend? look at me I am a trendsetter, lol. YES! I recommend that wholeheartedly, Ive walked and done more sight seeing during this pandemic than my entire life. Do you have scenic place to go? Do you like to read?
text:I do not have a scenic place but have some nice trails. I do read. I am reading bob iger's new autobiography. The seeker is excited to read about bread trend. The supporter could remind the seeker to start reading bread trend.	labels:Trails, offer an experience of letting go, I believe, you become immerse in nature. I would definitely explore all trails.  I did not know Iger had a book out. That sounds really interesting, I would actually love to read it, is it dull? or engaging? I do remember the headlines, he forgo his salary despite the risk of Disney losing billions in revenue, that takes guts. Do you have a pet?.
text:His book is good. Do you enjoy reading to help relax? The seeker has reached out to a friend and does not have any experience with the other person. The supporter could suggest that the seeker has a pet. The supporter could also ask the seeker to change the subject.	labels:I need to pick it up and dive into it. I love reading, I always tend to have a book in my hands. Yes, reading has served to not only help me relax but to teach me how to do other things, like baking. what is your favorite book?
text:I love the Harry Potter book series. I picked up Sorcerer's Stone when I was 21 or 22 and it provided me with some alternative to the normal drinking and late nights I had grown accustom to. Helped me apprecate books more too! The seeker is feeling relaxed and even the supporter can help the seeker to relax.	labels:Harry potter are THE books to dive into and just immerse yourself in. I would Highly recommend The Hobbit books, I was a bit hesitant about, but dare I say I like them more than Harry Potter? If you want something more adult and edgy go with Game of Thrones. I get it, I think this pandemic is a period to learn about ourselves and truly pick ourselves apart and see what we have missing out on..
text:I have heard good things about Tolkin's books but have not gotten into them yet. I do like the movies though! The seeker seems to be having a tough time over the lack of time, time and time. The supporter can point out that time is wasted and time management is important. The supporter can also suggest that a friend or family member would be a great way to help.	labels:Sounds to me you have been handling the pandemic a lot more better than what you actually think. I have been wanting to check out Lord of the rings, but I feel I wont like, either way, I am hoping to check them out and really see if I dont like. I love movies as well, what is your favorite genre and movie?
text:I like movies. I usually like spy thrillers or at least have recently. What's yours? The seeker thinks the pandemic is getting more stressful.

text:I am not sure. She is telling me things that by supervisor should tell me. She is saying "He told me this...". The seeker found a coworker bragging about her boss. The supporter could say that this is a great example of the danger of gossiping.	labels:have you asked your supervisor about it?
text:Not yet. It just started last week. I am thinking about asking this week. He usually calls me. The seeker feels insecure about her job and she is worried about her supervisor.

text:Thanks. Have you tried anything that has been helpful? The seeker is feeling uncomfortable about her boss but she is not sure why. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her supervisor or talk to her boss directly to find out what the problem is.	labels:what i did is just talk to the person about the situation and let them know how i was feeling.
text:Should I talk with my employee first or my boss? The seeker has been asked to talk to her boss first. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her boss first.	labels:i would talk to your boss first that would be best. let him know everything you are feeling. just don't worry to much about the situation and don't let it stress you out everything will be okay.
text:That sounds like a good plan. I am only stressed because it is hurtful and my employee likes to beb the center of attention. The seeker feels stressed because she is worried about her boss. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her boss first so that she doesn't stress unnecessarily.	labels:I understand what you mean about that just do not worry about people like that your main focus is doing your job. people are going to talk but you have to just ignore them and move on do not worry about what people say or think about you.
text:Yeah. I am trying to detach from it but my ego is getting hurt, which usually doesn't happen. The seeker feels stressed because it is hurtful to not be the center of attention. The supporter could tell the seeker to change how she is thinking about the situation.	labels:you will be okay no matter what.
text:That means a lot. That was a nice thing to say! The seeker feels energized and a lot more confident. The supporter should explain the situation to the seeker to gain some motivation and to make it more comfortable.	labels:the only way the situation will be solved is by communicating and expressing your feelings.	episode_done:True

text:I am having a difficult time not being able to go out. I am an introvert and didn't think COVID-19 would be a problem but I find myself being short and impatient. The seeker feels frustrated because she feels she is not being able to do anything. The supporter could do a favor and refer her to a doctor to help her out.	labels:Yeah i'm in the same boat. It's tough having to be cooped up.
text:How have you coped with it? The seeker is dealing with the stress of being cooped up. The supporter should offer advice on coping.	labels:Are you working from home?
text:Yes but I go in 1-2 days per week. It is in a building where I am by myself so that is not great. The seeker feels anxious about the lack of time. The supporter could tell the seeker to work on her time schedule.	labels:I've been having a hard time too and I've absolutely noticed that I've become short and impatient with people lately. I have been trying to be mindful but it's hard. I find going for walks and getting slight exercise helps.. I'm also pretty introverted and at first i enjoyed the shutdowns but as time drags on it's gotten difficult. Have you found ways to be physically active?
text:I work out all the time and that does help. I would like to just go out and have a drink at a bar but were shut down. Yes, I work out everyday. I will run for an hour later followed by 100 push ups and situps. The seeker learned about being physically active. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has to do that. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to do some physical activity.	labels:Does that help at all?
text:A little. But I have always done that so I feel like that is just normal. It used to be done at a gym but that is not safe now. The seeker has decided to exercise and is now exercising. The supporter could recommend them to go out and have a drink. The supporter should know to go out and have a drink.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker should go out and socialize, watch a movie and go to a bar together.	labels:I've definitely noticed that for myself, even though I normally prefer my space and solitude.

text:I zoom with them every few weeks. have you tried anything that helps? The seeker does not seem to be able to use the internet, but the supporter could suggest that the seeker can use a website. The supporter could also suggest to get some advice on how to be more outgoing.	labels:I seem to feel better after communicating with friends but I also get a little overwhelmed with video chats. I feel like Im always on my computer now so I'm working at trying to actively seeing my friends even if it means distancing or whatever. Do you have a park or a hiking trail or something that you could meet them at? That way you stay outside and can distance as necessary.
text:That makes sense. I feel I am on my computer a lot now too. I am thinking about going to the park shortly with my dog. I also think my kid's homework and remote learning has stressed me. The seeker is stressed due to the phone and video chat. The supporter should ask the seeker to consider the importance of being outside and away from the computer.	labels:Do you have friends that could go with you to the dog park? Do you think you'd feel comfortable physically being around other people?
text:I am ok with it. My parks are pretty empty now. I think that sounds like a wonderful idea. The seeker felt comfortable with friends. The supporter could also find out if any other friends of hers live in the area.	labels:im sure seeing someone in person will help even if it's for a few minutes. Once you figure out how to hang out with someone that makes you both comfortable, the next times will be that much easier..
text:That sounds good. Thanks for your help. The seeker is looking for friends. The supporter could tell the seeker that go out and do things in nature and socialize.

The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and ask them to be helpful.	labels:Awe thanks! I appreciate you too..	episode_done:True
text:HI, how are you today?\nI am not doing well. I am very worried about my son's chances of recovery after so many relapses and frustrated because I know there is really nothing I can do to change things for him. The seeker was kind of worried about son's recovery. The supporter could suggest she set up a study group to talk about it.	labels:You must be very frustrated from feeling unable to do something.

The supporter could also say that these relapses are very common.	labels:I remember when my mother was having end of life mental declining issues. I understand feeling as if the person is changing and having unusual moods and mood swings. . Do you have anyone you can talk to?
text:I try not to think about the situation, because I don't see him since he lives in another state. But I can't get everything out of my mind. And yes I have my husband to talk to, that helps some. It's when I'm trying to sleep or when my husband isn't home that's the worst for me. The seeker is not sure if she is feeling stressed or worried. The supporter could tell the seeker not to think about anything and talk to her husband.	labels:You are feeling the way anybody in your situation would fee like. It must be helpful to have a husband who listens and can be supportive when he is there. Have you always had sleep issues?
text:It does help but he's as frustrated and upset as I am. I can't sleep at night for dwelling on everything and I don't know how to stop the thoughts about all the terrible things that could happen. When I'm upset about something I cannot sleep but if I'm in a good state of mind I sleep well. The seeker feels more depressed and anxious and wants the supporter to console her. The supporter should say something like, "I can't do anything for you, but I will try."	labels:Being upset can make someones mind race and make it really difficult to rest or get any sleep at all. Have you ever gone through anything like this before?
text:Yes I've been dealing with my son's addiction and recovery and relapses for the last three years. The seeker feels angry, frustrated, and disoriented about dealing with addiction. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist.	labels:I can relate to being close to someone who is addicted. It can feel very sad and lonely at times. I would want to change the person in my life but just has to learn to let go instead. It is a process that takes years to learn.
text:I am realizing that more every day. If it wasn't my son and just a good friend I would probably end the relationship but a mother can't do that to her own children, you know what I mean? And you are so right. I can't change or control him, I can only change and control myself and my responses to him. That is so difficult to do. The seeker feels lonely and sad because her son is not doing well and her husband is away. The supporter should ask the seeker to reflect on her husband and the love she feels for him.	labels:Yes, I understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them. Sometimes it feels like we can change them or re raise them if we just do more for them. Have you had the chance to speak to a close friend or pastor about this situation?
text:Not really. Most of my friends haven't dealt with that so they don't really understand what I am going through, or even what my son is going through. But you're right, I have to learn to let go and let him fix his own problems with no intereference from me. The seeker seems bothered by her son. The supporter could talk about her son's addiction and recovery.	labels:You are very self aware and have good insight. I notice that you are very in touch with your feelings. You can use writing as a way to release emotions and express yourself, as you are now.
text:Thank you, I will try that. Like a journal maybe? The seeker feels self aware, but is not expressing a lot of feelings or thinking about her son's situation. The supporter could suggest that the seeker look into her own past and address her feelings or thoughts.	labels:Yes, I can recommend a journal on Amazon that I also use. Thank you for sharing with me today. Please reach back out anytime.
text:Thank you so much! I appreciate what you do! The seeker feels overstimulated by the friend or pastor, who is supportive and caring.

text:I am alone and on the road so it makes it hard. The seeker feels alone. The supporter could remind the seeker to talk to a friend.	labels:That makes sense.

text:Mine is Garbo. She craves attention as well. She needs attention from someone besides me as well. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could ask the seeker to work on getting attention from someone. The supporter could also ask the seeker to work on getting the dog to the shelter.	labels:Do you talk to Garbo? Or bring Garbo to dog parks? That's a great way to do something for both you and Garbo!!
text:yes I talk with her and if there is a park I will let her run. The seeker has the dog, but does not talk to her dog. The supporter can tell the seeker to talk to her dog often.	labels:Dog parks tend to have a lot of owners who also love dogs. They can love on Garbo and give you some connection too.
text:We lived in Florida and went to the beach everyday. yeah the parks are ok, but I let her run more openly. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the beach because it reminds her of the beach experience. The supporter could say that the seeker is not letting the dog run without a leash. The supporter could say that they are giving the seeker access to a leash.	labels:It sounds like Garbo likes the outdoors.
text:Yes. She loves it.. The seeker feels lonely, but has a dog and a dog park. The supporter should ask her if she has a dog park.	labels:Is the weather where you nice enough to take her out?
text:She does not mind snow either. It is chilly but ok. The seeker feels like there are many dogs in the parks. The supporter could suggest that the seeker visit more parks to meet more dogs.	labels:Ok. My dog, Phineas, love the snow!
text:Garbo hates small animals also. Especially skunks. The seeker feels stressed because of the weather. The supporter could suggest that the seeker get a little snow in her hair and some snowballs. The supporter could also suggest that she start running a little.	labels:Oh Garbo! Hahahaha! She sounds wonderful!

text:3 years ago. The seeker is able to talk to her dog. The supporter could also talk to her dog.	labels:Wow! That is almost once a year.
text:She never learns either. The seeker feels that her dog, Garbo, is a good pet. The supporter could ask the seeker to bring her dog, Tarzan, outside.	labels:Do you think she will do it again? Do you think she will do it again?
text:Yes. She sees the color and off she goes. The seeker is excited about seeing her dog. The supporter would suggest taking her dog for some walks, then bring her in for a playdate.	labels:That is so interesting. Research shows that dogs are color-blind. It must be to contrast!
text:But she can see the stripes. The seeker is embarrassed about not being able to see the color. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take this out of the conversation and focus on the dog.	labels:Right! Good eye, Garbo!	episode_done:True

The supporter can help the seeker by letting the seeker know that they have a bad friend, they can talk about it with the friend, but don't tell the friend that he has a bad friend.	labels:do you think he is mad at you?
text:yes, naturally he will congratulate me as he viewed the pictures. The seeker has not told the supporter anything the supporter needs to know. The supporter should ask the seeker what her friend is thinking.	labels:i know this can be a tough situation but I believe this situation will pass and everything will be ok between you to. do not let this stress you out or worry that he is mad everything will be ok. i would suggest asking him if he saw your post about the car and ask him if he is mad about it.

The supporter could push the seeker to ask if he is happy with the car.	labels:If you are comfortable enough facing him then ask him. Just do not force yourself if you are not comfortable doing that.

The supporter could suggest ways to help the seeker.	labels:You might even want to call your friends and colleagues to see if any of them are meeting up. We are social creatures.

The supporter should ask more details, such as the reasons the seeker is worried about the work.	labels:I'm sure you are busy, but realize, your emotional health is important too and we always need to make time to connect with people..
text:you are right. may be i should think of more relevant options. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk to friends and family members.	labels:I think it is a trade off for us -- do we risk a disease we have a 99.9996% chance of survival from according to the CDC or stay at home and despair?  I see no evidence of a pandemic nor do my nurse friends. So we live our lives normally. But some are afraid, and fear takes its toll on people. I say use your eyes, look around, if there aren't people dying all around you and you aren't hearing of a lot of people dying in ten months of this, there probably aren't a lot of people dying. And life is short. Hug those you love, you may not have them tomorrow, plandemic or not.. I know you are working hard, but do try to switch up your life so you get some exercise and take care of your health, and perhaps list some people to call who you haven't checked in with in a while to switch up your life, bring some pizzazz.. I was feeling REALLY lonely last month, and then I started a gratitude list and that helped, then I called some people and began to make new friends. It really helped a lot..

It feels like death.. I know a lot of people who would LOVE a home cooked meal, and sharing a meal together is so emotionally fulfilling.. Is there anything else I can help you with? If not, you have to close out the hit so we can finish the conversation and get paid! :D.	episode_done:True

text:Hello. The seeker is shown greeting. The supporter should ask the seeker to do something to the seeker's background. The supporter should ask the seeker to set up a study group to get more motivation to go to work.	labels:Hello, how are you doing today?

The seeker feels stressed because she is not good at scheduling time. The supporter could suggest that she should get a planner and try to schedule time in an organized way.	labels:That sounds like a great idea, having a friend like that really puts a positive spin on things. You could also consider the dollar tree, they have planners for only a dollar.

This is a great way to encourage the seeker to think about that idea again.	labels:I am so glad I was able to help you come to a solution! You will be back on track before you know it.

Do you have a good support system? Did he give a reason for the breakup?
text:no. he didn't told me anything. avoiding me all the time. i don't have a support system either. The seeker was not communicating how serious the breakup was. The supporter could just let the seeker tell the seeker how serious the breakup was. The supporter could tell the seeker to have a good time and try to keep her feelings "on the down low".	labels:Are you telling me he just said "I am breaking up with you" then never said why and left?
text:he thinks everything is casual . we were happy. he is behaving like this all of a sudden. what should i think then ? The seeker was afraid that she was going to be hurt. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a therapist and talk about her feelings.	labels:I think he doesn't know what he wants and thinks the grass is greener on the other side of the fence. It is disrespectful to you. And hurtful. You say you have no support, don't you have friends? Family?
text:i don't have a family. i am living alone in a city where am working. i have not met anyone because of the pandemic.. The seeker explains that she is not a family. The supporter could ensure that the seeker has a supportive family. The supporter could also ask if the seeker has any friends.	labels:I think you might want to join an online support group then.

The supporter could ask her to share her goals and aspirations.	labels:You are welcome. I am happily married now, but I had my fair share of breakups. They hurt my self esteem. I had to work hard to not let that happen. And do my best to grieve, but not get stuck there.. If a man did not want to be with me, I took it hard as rejection, but in the long run, if he does not want to be with me, I don't want to be with him, but that takes time, and you need friends to encourage you..
text:you really are a strong person.. yes. if i follow him, i will be the one to get hurt. its time for me to accept the reality. The seeker is accepting reality and it is strong. The supporter should ask the seeker if she could not get over the break up. It would be helpful if they talk about the reasons the seeker is feeling the way she is.	labels:Thank you. I'm older, been through a LOT of hard knocks. You will be stronger too, right now you are hurting, in time you will see more clearly..
text:hoping the same. i should be strong and take this as an experience to learn. The seeker is hopeful that this will be a learning experience. The supporter could tell the seeker that they can be happy here. The supporter could also say that the seeker has to work on her work to get better.	labels:He hasn't told you why, so the problem lies in him, not you. So do your best not to be hard on yourself. It is a shock to you now, but he never even communicated this with you over time, and he should have. that's what you want in a partner.. If a relationship has problems, you want someone to talk about he problems and work on them and grow as two people. He chose to walk away, that's immature and not what you want in a relationship. That is actually abusive.
text:yes. its better to be alone than with a partner who didn't understand us. really you are awesome mam ! there is a lot to learn from you ! i feel like you can clearly see through my mind. The seeker feels hurt by the partner. The supporter could tell her that she is open to learning more about her partner. The supporter could also offer to take her to a therapy session.	labels:Thank you! You are so very kind! And you are very sweet too, willing to hear the truth! That is an admirable quality!  You deserve a partner willing to work on problems, not a quitter.. Do take care of yourself! Find some friends, work hard at that, call old friends too. Just to say hi, call an old aunt or uncle and check in. Find community. That will help you..
text:i should take a break from this relationship issues and try to enjoy myself and heal from this. you are kind too mam !. your partner is really lucky to have you. sure mam. i will really try hard.. The seeker feels able to enjoy herself during the break. The supporter could also offer a carrot to make her happy.	labels:Yes! Don't hop into another relationship for a long time, months, even a year. Find out who you are. Be the woman you want to be. I prayed for my husband for a long time. God is good! :D I had a lot of bad ones before him!.
text:we all learn from our experiences. yes. i want to be emotionally independent. i should take a break and travel after this pandemic. hope you will be happy as well..

The supporter could tell the seeker to take a break from the relationship and not be dependent on her partner. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she needs to have a healthy relationship with her partner.	labels:Thank you so much!.	episode_done:True
text:hello. The seeker does greet. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hi! How are you this evening?
text:pretty depressed all in all. I dont know how to get out of this slump. The seeker was depressed. The supporter could ask the seeker to tell the seeker how to get out of the slump. The supporter could also tell the seeker to talk to people who have the same issues she has.	labels:Sorry to hear that. How long have you been in a slump?
text:Quite a while, of course it really got worse once the pandemic hit. I am in a pretty bad marriage he is not supportive in any way. It's getting worse instead of better. I suppose I used to be able to distract myself with the outside world and right now I cant. The seeker feels depressed because of the marriage. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not being supportive. The supporter could also ask to make the seeker go to therapy.	labels:I can understand that. It's been hard on a lot of people. Sometimes marriages need a bit of help during tough times, have you considered a counselor?.
text:I have tried, he won't go again. We have before and it didn't really help. He argued with her. The seeker feels depressed because she is struggling with a marriage. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for a marriage counselor.	labels:My husband and I have gone a few times and it really helped having an objective person give us a few tips. We learned a lot even in just a few short months. We set goals, achieved them and then years passed and went again.. That's too bad that he won't go again. I would still go for yourself. I have gone by myself because I needed extra help.  And it's hard to deal with someone who doesn't want to grow and change..
text:I am happy it worked for you :) I just dont see it working with us. Hes pretty stubborn. I also struggle with a severe auto immune disorder so that is always weighing on me as well. The seeker feels insecure about coming to a friend for help. The supporter should explain that the seeker already has a partner or a friend. In this conversation, the seeker feels insecure about coming to a friend for help. The supporter could explain that the seeker already has a partner or a friend.	labels:I had an auto immune disorder too, actually, the counseling helped that a lot. Emotions have a way of wreaking havoc on our bodies. And it sounds like life has been stressful for you lately.. Having a physical problem is really hard to deal with in addition to problems in marriage. Do you have any goals set?
text:Yes, stress is terrible for chronic illness. I had goals to get back in check with myself, I've been worried about everyone else for so long and not really about me. The pandemic haulted a lot of that. I used to take rides and go out and enjoy nature or something simple by myself to rejuvinate but it's harder now being worried to be around people. I also have an 8 and 1 year old. While they are my world, it's taxing having littles depend on you 24/7 without a breather :) The seeker feels stressed because she misses her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker that she should do something with the children, get more motivation and try to be as physically active as possible.	labels:It sounds like you have a full plate with the little one. I know a lot of people are fearful now, but rest assured, children are really resilient to disease. The CDC has not even one record of a healthy child dying. Can you still go to the park and let them run and play? I think it's healthier to be around people then to isolate. That's my personal observation. It's really taking a toll on all of us emotionally to be distant.. little ones . . ..
text:For a few months I eased up and let them play at the park, but we live in MI which is having another huge spike, especially our county. Thank goodness we have a pretty large yard for them to run and play in but I also know its not the same. The seeker feels that she is doing well and she is not isolating herself. The supporter could also suggest to have a few conversations with friends or family to be able to feel supported and loved.	labels:One thing that comes to mind about your marriage is how I continued to work on myself, and surprisingly, some of the changes I made in myself helped my husband change. For example. I realized I didn't speak respectfully to him all the time.  So I changed my tone. Sometimes I didn't FEEL respectful, but I read this book explaining how men really need that. So I changed me. And you know what, he really responded well to that. Became more kind and loving. I prayed a lot and that is one thing God showed me. I read a few books on what men were like and how I could help my marriage. My husband often oblivious, but when I worked on me and doing things that men like, he actually became a better man. Hard to explain. I would encourage you to write out some goals and things you want to change about yourself, ideas for you and your children to do. And fight the blues as hard as you can. I find that if I have a list of things I need to do, I can follow that even when I don't feel like it, and sometimes I get out of the slump.
text:It makes total sense. I have tried to do some research and yes work on myself as well. I have done a ton of praying. I do need to make new goals. They help me stay on track, thats for sure.. Of course now that I'm home schooling my oldest I'm tearing my hair out there as welll. lol! I always had a huge amount of respect for teachers, but wow! The seeker feels stressed but she doesn't do anything that would help her. The supporter could suggest help with homework, a journal, and to be a better parent.	labels:It sounds like you do know good things to do, and that sometimes you need that encouragement and and support. Do you have friends maybe to check in with? Just to chat. I have been doing that myself. Just phoning people to connect. It has helped so much. Just to say hi and share my life.. Life has a way of handing us curveballs. It upsets us then we don't know what to do, we fall down and get in a slump. And I find that writing lists, making goals, calling friends, doing things differently, brainstorming solutions can help me get back on track..
text:I need to do that more! When my maternal grandma passed away in 2013 I kind of fell away from just calling people up. She was my go to person to call, always. She and my grandpa raised me and its been hard to pick up a phone knowing I cannot call her. Sounds weird I know. The seeker feels like they are giving up. The supporter could tell the seeker that they should try to keep their life as a priority and to focus on their goals.	labels:It is NOT weird. I'm like a granma to you! hahaha I'm almost 60. We need people in our lives, older, younger, all ages. We all learn from each other. Perhaps call and aunt and check in with them. Sometimes it makes us feel better to reach out and encourage others..
text:I will try to do this more, for sure! Thank you for this conversation, I feel like it has helped me remember the things I can do to start working on myself again! The seeker feels like a grandma. The supporter should encourage the seeker to keep doing things that she thinks will help her sanity.	labels:As for your son and homeschooling, I'm sure you are challenged but think of this as a great opportunity. Perhaps teach him to cook? Make games up that are learning games about how to care for a home, perhaps repair things, all kinds of ideas. Perhaps have him test you on things..
text:Sounds like a plan for sure :) I will do this, he would really enjoy it! The seeker is thankful to her friend and her friend has helped her with her dreams. The supporter could also tell the seeker to invest in more toys. The supporter could encourage the seeker to call her friend and express THANK YOU to her.	labels:I'm glad I could encourage you. You sound very intelligent and caring. Marriage is hard work, so is motherhood, but it can be rewarding and fulfilling. Sometimes we lose track of that and we need ideas to perk us up again and help us remember our goals..	episode_done:True
text:i am feeling sad. my boyfriend left me out of the blue. The seeker feels sad because of the breakup. The supporter should set up time to talk about it.	labels:I am so sorry for hearing that. Do you want to talk more detail about that?
text:yes, i want to. i am unable to concentrate in anything. i feel so negative about my life. what is the point of this relationship then ? The seeker feels sad because she is not happy, so the supporter could ask her to stop thinking negative about her life.	labels:You seem really focus on just one person. Life is rich. Think about other important people in your life such as parents, friends.
text:i can understand all of this. may be i need some time. The seeker feels sad. The supporter could suggest the seeker to visit friends or work on learning how to be more reflective. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should practice mindfulness.	labels:Yes of course you should take your time as long as you want and you can do it, one day you can leave all those problem.
text:hoping the same. want to  be the happy person like i was before. The seeker is sad because of the boyfriend leaving her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of other important people in her life.	labels:Also do exercise, yoga, workout, talk your friends, listen to music etc sort of things might help you a lot. whatever works for you, you'll try them out. Just chatting with you, you seem very a smart, strong girl. Do not be upset about things you can't control.
text:i think i should divert my concentration on something else.. The seeker could divert her attention to something else. The supporter should remind the seeker to concentrate on her goals, goals should be made, goals should be set.	labels:For sure, what else we need to talk about?
text:it really hurts when the person means you the most becomes unavailable out of the blue without stating any reason. nothing. thanks for your support anyways. i am glad talking to you. The seeker feels bad because she is not able to concentrate on her boyfriend. The supporter should reassure her that she can always leave if she wants to.	labels:I feel the same way.

text:none. how are you coping up with the current situation? The seeker is stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to stop worrying and focus on what they have the most control over.	labels:Kinda Ok, but struggling with some issues such as eating unhealthy.
text:why can't to cook in your home? is there anyone to help you ? The seeker feels lonely and worried about the cooking. The supporter could tell the seeker that if the seeker cooks, she would feel happier. The supporter could also offer to make the seeker chocolate.	labels:not sure, i can cook myself however the situation pushes me unhealthy choice somehow lol. Btw, it helps for your current mood, does not it? I mean we are talking about other stuffs which make you think about your problem less?	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nhello. The seeker does not know which to do at the moment. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try this and send her some supportive messages. The supporter could also say something like, "I am so proud of you for getting through this, but I know this will come back to haunt you."	labels:How are you this evening?
text:I am doing ok. I am feeling very sad. How are you? The seeker feels sad about not being able to get new job and feeling pressured by job situation. The supporter could encourage the seeker to find other options for academic stress.	labels:I am doing well, I am sorry to hear you are feeling sad. What is bothering you tonight?
text:I am going through a terrible divorce from an abusive narcissitic ex, But we have two young kids. I haven't seen them in months because he lied to CPS and told them I abuse my kids.

The supporter could remind the seeker to talk to people about the situation and tell her that she can feel alone with her children.	labels:Sorry about that, ex-husband. I can definitely tell this is making you feel very anxious and sad from the few messages we have exchanged.
text:Yes very much so. Do you have any advice? The seeker feels anxious and sad, but the supporter gave no advice. The seeker should try to find a therapist as well.	labels:I recently went through a hard break up with an ex-fiancé who got pregnant from another man, so I know how difficult a situation like this can be,
text:Oh my goodness. My ex is out to destroy me emotionally. The seeker feels fearful about her ex-fiancé and how she is going to be able to get pregnant. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and family to know more about this. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to go to the lawyer to get a restraining order against this ex-fiancé.	labels:Have you had a conversation with him with some sort of objective third party to try and work through the differences in seeing your children? Often times, having an objective 3rd party helps to get somewhere in a conversation.

The supporter could also ask the seeker to seek out a volunteer organization like the American College of Physicians.	labels:I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious. Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there? Often it helps to keep in touch with previous co-workers, especially during a time like this.
text:Yes, I do have the numbers of a few of them. I talked to them a little during the day but I mainly kept to myself as I planned my next few steps. I was just ashamed for having left after they have been so helpful. I pride myself in being loyal and supportive but it was just too much risk to myself and family. The seeker has been very stressed.

The seeker is so sad and confused over her partner. The supporter could give her some advice.	labels:You did nothing wrong. It's something wrong with him, if he did this to you, he'll probably do it again to her. Do you really want to be with someone that disregards your well being like that?

The seeker is worried that he might not get a relationship back with his partner. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:I understand, it's easy to get sucked back into the nostalgic good memories of when things were at their best.

I just want those times to come around again even though I know they should not.. The seeker feels that she is doing something wrong with her partner and needs to be told flat out that she is not doing well in her job. She also believes that he is a jerk and does not respect her. She does not like the supporter's advice about the gender roles of her gender and thinks that she is being discriminated against.	labels:It really sucks, doesn't it? And it's not a walk in the park to get over someone when you've been so close to them. Breakups are kind of like a bad cut. They really hurt for a bit, but then a scar eventually forms over it and you start to forget about it.

The supporter should focus on the cause of the breakup, not the girl.	labels:Do you have a group of friends, or activities to keep you busy while you're going through this? It helps to keep your mind distracted :) And you are so welcome! I've been through my share of breakups too, it's never fun!

The seeker feels lonely around friends and there are no activities to keep her busy. The supporter can suggest the seeker to join a study group to get more motivation.	labels:Friends come and they go, it doesn't have to be a game of choosing sides.

text:That is good advice too. Or maybe I could do something to help me make new friends? Do you have any suggestions?. The seeker is still upset about the break up. The supporter could talk about friends that keep in touch with the seeker.	labels:Totally! It helps to get into group activities, like hiking to going to the gym, or a book club..
text:I do love to read - I think that I will totally look into joining a book club. I would really like to meet new people, not to date specifically but just to be friends..

The supporter could ask the seeker to cut back on the huge amount of packages she was supposed to receive.	labels:yes. sorry to hear that. How can i help.

Pissed me right off. The seeker feels frustrated that the supporter did not do anything. The supporter could do something to help the seeker. The supporter could talk to the seeker about the issue.	labels:Tell me what happened. That sounds horrible.

We agreed on n160  for the whole mess and HE JUST DECIDES that its now 185 cause he needed gas, and what ever.. Nah man, I already fill your tank and food and he can grab some fries from the bag when he gets here. The seeker is frustrated because he got the middleman rate. The supporter should know what happened and offer the seeker some advice.	labels:wow. get him a gas card for christmas then he cant say anything next time.
text:haha YES! see it is a stupid thing. like dood we hook your ass up all the tome. time. The seeker has no idea what to say. The supporter can help her by using the conversation to ask her questions, asking her to give a detailed explanation of what happened.	labels:People suck.

The seeker feels stressed about having to deal with her husband. The supporter could suggest that the seeker could track the spending habits of her husband.	labels:Wow that sounds like a big problem. Is he aware of how much distress this is causing you?.
text:I've tried talking to him about it, but he claims that he needs to reward himself or he wouldn't do anything. Like, if he gets up and goes to work then he needs to eat out to reward himself. The seeker is distressed because she feels alone. The supporter could try to clarify the extent of the problem.	labels:So you feel that he is misunderstanding life? That he feels that he deserves things just for existing?.

The seeker thinks that husband is spoiling her by making her feel guilty and angry. The supporter could try to talk to him.	labels:It sounds like a really toxic relationship - I hear you! I have been in that position also. In the end I felt that I had no choice but to leave. I cannot tell you what to do, though..

The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to make sure she has enough money for therapy.	labels:I believe that there are some organisations that will offer free therapy sessions for people in need.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker needs to reevaluate her relationship with her husband.	labels:I am not totally sure what is available but I think that there might be such things.
text:Thanks for your help. You said you've been in similar relationships. Is this behavior common for men?. The seeker feels like men are trying to pay for therapy. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should ask for money from a charity that could help the person.	labels:Well no, I don't think that all men are like this by any stretch of the imagination. Unfortunately, however, there are some bad apples who give all men a bad name. I am sure that the same applies to women too though!.
text:Haha, true. I just wondered. I had previous relationships, but they were very short.  My dad was always the opposite: he was a penny-pincher. Sometimes I worry that maybe I'm just to stingy with the money, but then I remember that we have none, so Idk how to be more generous lol. The seeker experiences negative relationship with her father. The supporter should tell the seeker to talk to friends and share with friends the positive relationship with her father.	labels:You sound to me as though you are being realistic and sensible about your financial situation and are being neither too stingy nor too lavish..

I can't wait until we get back to normal classroom settings, and I also hope fervently that the vaccine process is quick, efficient, and effective. I find that making regular online meetings with my professor, while it might not help with the physicality of your work, at least provides mental and motivational boosts. Do you ever meet with them in any capacity?
text:honestly its all a shit show right now. Everything is tied up in logistics and stop and starts. this year has been almost a wash. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could help the seeker by giving her a concrete action to take to help her get back to normal.	labels:It's been the same way at my school.

text:true, I guest if the ship goes down we all go down. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:If there's only one thing to take from this, it's knowing you aren't alone. I have confidence that you, and this entire country, is going to get through these difficult times..
text:I believe that too. thanks for the reassurance. I just have a hard time sitting still. The seeker is tired of being a student. The supporter could tell the seeker to ask for support from another student.	labels:I definitely get that. It's especially hard because we've had to sit still for so long.

text:imagine when it happens. when everything is the way it was a year ago. a beer. at a bar. The seeker feels the need to get a drink, but the supporter needs to know what the seeker is drinking. The supporter could remind the seeker that she is not a drinker.	labels:That sounds incredible. Or just to be able to go into a store without a mask and hand sanitizer and constantly monitoring how close you are to people. It's almost impossible to imagine, to be honest.

I was the one who broke things off because I know longer felt much love coming from her. I felt neglected and I thought a break up was the best solution. I did not think she would pick up a new guy two weeks later. I was not prepared to deal with this kind of pain and it hurts. The seeker feels neglected by her girlfriend. The supporter could say that she would not have been able to feel this pain if she were here. The supporter could also help the seeker find a break up site.	labels:It was wise of you to know your feeling towards the relationship and make a mature decision for the both of you. During this pandemic too. that must have been even harder. .

The supporter could also ask the seeker to find a therapist.	labels:nothing better than the outdoors wit h some friends. Fresh air can really clear the mind.

The seeker is thinking that the friend group would be better after she makes some attempts to disconnect with her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a time to keep in touch with her boyfriend and to be there for her when she is in the zone.	labels:perspective is found from looking at things from a distance. you maybe to close to everything right now to see the forest from the trees.

The supporter could also say that there are people who are willing to support her if she is feeling alone.

The world will get back to normal. and you will too.

The supporter could offer her the advice to go visit a therapist or therapy group to get some answers.	labels:Ah you did not mention that!

text:Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.

The supporter could ask the seeker for some specific advice about what she can do about the situation.	labels:If he isn't interested in the job himself I'm sure he wouldn't see it that way.

The supporter could suggest to talk with the coworker as a way to try and get him/her to support her.	labels:Having support in the workplace would be very helpful.

text:I think so. I am not a gossip nor do I want to. Thanks for your help! Any other thoughts? The seeker is afraid of being judged, but the supporter can tell she is not a gossip. The supporter could also suggest that she consult the board about the gossip.	labels:I would say maybe try some meditation or something to calm and center yourself.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker should talk to friends and relatives.	labels:I am so sorry you are going through this and i know how you are feeling .
text:Thanks. It's been weird. I just met with two of the board today to go over where the organization is. The seeker feels scared because of the board of directors. The supporter could help the seeker to talk to the board.	labels:you should not have anything to worry about as long as you did not play the game then you will be fine and you will not get in trouble or your boss will not see that as a problem.

The supporter could have a talk with the seeker about why she should stay with the organization and not go to another job.	labels:Did you see your director playing the game? I would not bring up about you wanting her job just yet give it a couple of days.
text:No, her boss did not play the game. He actually pulled out and let others handle it so he didn't seem biased. She overplayed her hand.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her boss and explain that this is a big issue.	labels:I can see this is a tough being in a situation like this.
text:Yeah. I have never been this high in an organization so I just don't know what to do. I am hoping someone outside the organization might have a better view of what I should do. The seeker feels that she needs to make some changes in life. The supporter can tell the seeker to make some changes in her life.

The seeker feels guilty because of the investment and her friend is mean to her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should talk to a friend who is not mean.	labels:Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.

text:I agree and appreciate that I am not alone in thinking that! Many college students have been very irresponsible during the pandemic which is upsetting to me.. The seeker feels worried because it is unclear whether the adviser will be aware of her worries and have a plan to cope. The supporter could explain the concern to the seeker that she has a plan to cope with her worries.	labels:Is there anyone at your college who could help you with this? Perhaps move you into a single room?.
text:No, there aren't any sorority rooms available at my sorority house and all of the dorms/apartments are full already but I've tried . **single not sorority. The seeker feels unsafe with the dorms and is worried about living alone. The supporter could tell the seeker to move her into a top floor room. The supporter could also tell the seeker that if she is comfortable with the situation, she can move into a better room.	labels:Yes they certainly have. They seem to think that it will never happen to them and do not realise that they are putting others at risk.
text:agreed. The seeker felt restricted by the fact that there were no single rooms available. The supporter should give the seeker an opportunity to move into condid. The supporter should also say that she will get her roommate to help the seeker with the dorms and the roommate should help her find living arrangements.	labels:Is it possible for you to take some time off school?.
text:I shouldn't do that -- I am applying to law school when I graduate so I feel like it'd be a bad look. it'd also be bad for my mental health to stay home, and I'd rather take the classes I need next semester. The seeker feels that he has been put in danger by the room-mate. The supporter should tell the seeker that he or she is putting the seeker in danger by not taking time off school.	labels:So you feel as though you are trapped .. you can't leave school but at the same time you are being put at risk through no fault of your own.
text:right, it's very uncomfortable and no matter how many times I tell them how risky they are being to not only themselves but others they do not care. also one of them is pre med which is even worse lmao. The seeker feels trapped because she feels unsafe to leave school. The supporter could tell the seeker that it's a bad idea to stay at school.	labels:Please be assured that you are being sensible and that they are the ones at fault.
text:thank u :) The seeker feels trapped and worries about taking time off school. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and share experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to get professional therapy and support.	labels:Let's hope that this is over soon .. this has been an absolutely terrible year..
text:Agreed! Hoping for that vaccine soon. what challenges have you faced from the pandemic? The seeker feels scared of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to share some stories about the pandemic and have other people talk about it. The supporter could also talk about it.	labels:Here in the UK they have started to roll it out..
text:I am so jealous! Things are so much better not in the USA! The seeker feels the pandemic is at the least making life difficult and the supporter could suggest that she needs to get out of the country and get a job. The supporter could also suggest that she get a job in the US.	labels:I have to agree ;) But we have a large infection and death rate here too, largely due to government irresponsibility.
text:haha yes we had the same issue with government mishandling everything ... so frustrating. The seeker feels particularly annoyed and anxious because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share experiences with similar experiences. The supporter could also ask her and her friends about what their experiences were like and what they would want to do to support others.	labels:Do you feel it would be better to be somewhere like New Zealand then, where there have been very few cases? It is a lovely country..
text:haha yes definitely! I would love to study abroad next year so I hope that will still be an option and COVID will be better then. The seeker feels reassured, but does not tell the supporter that it is an option and she would love to study abroad. The supporter could tell the seeker that if she wants to study abroad, it shouldn't be a problem.	labels:So, you feel frustrated both by your roommate and also the conditions in your country?.
text:yes for sure. The seeker feels frustrated about roommates. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should try to get a roommate.	labels:I can sincerely wish that the world is in a better place next year.
text:As do I... although I'm not sure if things will ever go back to the way they were before. But hopefully that is for the best. The seeker feels frustrated at the conditions in her country because of the lack of COVID. The supporter could suggest that the seeker visit a friend of hers who is in the country and encourage them with the conditions.	labels:Perhaps we can learn something from this year and improve ourselves.
text:I agree! It's definitely been a year of reflection for sure. The seeker has a feeling of frustration. The supporter could try to change the seeker's feelings. The supporter could suggest that the seeker go to college.	labels:I hope I have been able to be of some help, just by allowing you to talk things out.
text:yes thank you you definitely have! enjoy the rest of your evening :) The seeker feels frustrated because of the continuing problems with the government. The supporter could reassure the seeker that the government is doing what is best for the country.	labels:And you too .. thanks for talking!.	episode_done:True
text:Hi! How are you this evening?\nI'm very sad. I found out my boyfriend went to see his ex. The seeker feels sad about going to see ex, not the ex. The supporter should suggest the seeker to go to a friend's house to work things out.	labels:I'm sorry to hear you are sad. What's going on? Maybe I can encourage you? Ouch! So he wants to see his ex? Basically he is breaking up with you? How long did you date him?
text:No, i hacked his facebook. He told me he was going to hang out with friends. but i found out he lied. we have been together for 3 years. he doesn't know that i know. The seeker is scared of going to his ex. The supporter would do the same thing and would provide some encouragement. The seeker could tell the supporter that she knows he is lying. The supporter could also offer to help her to find therapy.	labels:I'm so sorry to hear this. You must be full of all kinds of emotions now. What are your plans?
text:i don't know yet tbh. i have never been cheated on before. we also live together so it's complicated. The seeker felt cheated because she found out she cheated on her boyfriend. She could tell the supporter to ask her boyfriend about his recent confession.	labels:I can understand your frustration. It happened to me before. And I've had girlfriends. They never change. They will apologize because they got caught, but they never really change..
text:But, how do I know for sure if he did cheat? The seeker feels worried about the upcoming exams. The supporter could suggest her to connect with friends and share an experience. The supporter could also try to talk to the seeker and gain some confidence.	labels:It's going to be very painful for a while because you have been invested 3 years in this relationship. Do you have friends to talk to that can encourage and support you?.
text:The messages were about meeting up for a photoshoot at the brooklyn bridge. is that cheating because he lied. The seeker feels emotional, but the supporter could also tell her that she is upset and not planning to break up with her boyfriend. The supporter could also ask her to hold good memories in her mind.	labels:I find if they flirt, they already have cheated. Loyalty is something inside a person, or not. Very few will look inside themselves and see why they do this and want to change. If you were married, you would need counseling.. Do you meet up with your exes?
text:i'm still friends with many of my exes, but he knows that and we all hang out together. thats why it's weird that he lied. The seeker is still in the friend zone. The supporter should encourage the seeker to meet up with a few friends.	labels:He lied because he didn't want you to know the truth. Which is betrayal..
text:also, when he gets home, how do i tell him how i found out. i mean, i literally got into his facebook without asking. i just had this intuition that he was being suspicious. The seeker feels betrayed by the boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not telling her boyfriend the truth and trying to change his relationship status. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she does not feel that she can change his status because she does not know the truth about the relationship status of the boyfriend.	labels:It's a hot mess, is it not? Why did you feel you wanted to spy on him? Did you already mistrust him?
text:well, it was weird that he got so dressed up to go hang out with friends. it makes sense now that i know he went for a photoshoot. The seeker is confused because she was in an intimate relationship with her ex boyfriend. The supporter could suggest that the seeker talk to friends about this situation.	labels:Ok, so this is a HUGE red flag to you. You can ignore it, or not. Women KNOW when a man is cheating, so you had that inside of you. And you went with your hunch and now you have found he is dishonest.. Was the photoshoot to have pictures of him?
text:yeah, she's a photographer. she took all his headshots when he first moved to America, actually. when they were together. The seeker feels betrayed by the supporter. The supporter could tell the seeker that he didn't trust her to find out the truth. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she needs to stop making all of life a lie. That is the goal of the supporter.	labels:I suppose it could be Christmas pictures of him for you? Or not. I personally feel honesty is the best policy, no matter what. I would come clean. I would tell him I sensed trouble and looked for it and found it..
text:i worry that i am jumping to conclusions. The seeker feels concerned about the possibility of cheating and had no friends to support her. The supporter can tell the seeker that she is jumping to see if there is something wrong. The supporter could offer to talk about it in a group or do a reading. This conversation is about what the supporter knows about the situation.	labels:You could be, but then you wouldn't have a feeling of mistrust, you would just be sensing a surprise.
text:he may say: you are friends with ur exes, why can't i be friends with mine? he never said which friends he was going to see. he also didnt offer to take me with him, though. i always invite him when i hang out with my exes. The seeker feels wary about going with the logical decision to trust his ex. The supporter could encourage the seeker to have a meeting with her exes and speak to them.	labels:He could say that. And if he is lying, do you think he will begin to be honest? You will have to judge for yourself. If he is lying, he will continue to lie. And you will feel it inside of yourself. Is this the first time you felt this way? Or has this happened before?.
text:never before. i guess ur right. The seeker feels mistrustful. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is feeling suspicious.	labels:I'm an older woman, almost 60. I've been married 20 years but I had a lot of boyfriends and I can tell you one thing, If they start to look elsewhere, run for the hills, they will continue to excuse their behavior, apologize, say they will change, and it just gets worse. I drove myself insane with worry, suspicion. I wanted someone to treasure me, not cheat and lie. Cheaters don't change their spots..	episode_done:True
text:Hello there. What would you like to talk about?.\nHi, just broke up with my partner and I don't really know where to go from here. The seeker feels a lot of anxiety about breaking up with her partner.

The supporter should try to help her through this.	labels:Do you feel that is unfair of her to have done this whilst you were away serving your country?.
text:Kind of, I know that life moves on while people are away. I just don't get it though, I return and this is what I get. The seeker feels lonely and bereft after being hurt by a partner. The supporter could also tell the seeker that there are people in her life to make her feel loved.	labels:But she should have understood that you were doing your duty whilst also providing for the pair of you. Do you think it is possible that she has been unfaithful, or is it something else?.
text:Possibly, but we weren't official boyfriend/girlfriend. The seeker feels lonely and bereft. The supporter can tell the seeker to find someone to share her problems with. The supporter could also suggest a professional therapist.	labels:Ah I see. How committed did you feel to her?.
text:Maybe it was my indecision to ask her about our relationship. Now that I think about it, it seemed more of 80% me, 20% her. The seeker feels that they are the only person in the world who is unsure of the relationship. The supporter could ask the seeker to clarify that decision.	labels:I know, as a woman myself. that it is quite difficult when you are seeing someone but have no idea what their intentions are..
text:Sure, I guess sex and cuddling is nice, but what I really want is someone to shopping with and eventually build a future. The seeker is open and receptive to the supporter's advice. The supporter is reassuring her and asking her if she is okay with the relationship.	labels:Have you considered getting some sort of counselling, either just you or as a couple?.
text:It has peaked my interest, but at the same time, I wonder how much of this is just me buried in the idea of a relationship, even though it's pretty one-sided now. Should I seek counseling for a relationship that technically wasn't official? The seeker is looking for help, but does not know the source of help. The supporter could talk with the seeker, who is worried about her relationship with her partner.	labels:I am hearing you say that you still have feelings for her but you are not sure whether to totally break away or not, given that she has.
text:Yes. I hate how I love her, but I'm not getting the same energy back. The seeker feels that she still loves her partner because it was her decision to break up with her. The supporter could tell the seeker that the break-up is not an easy decision.	labels:I can't tell you what to do but I think it might be best to go with your gut instinct..
text:It will hurt, but it's definitely better just to move on, right? My gut tells me that I'm not going to take 2nd place in her heart. The seeker feels hurt by the relationship and does not want to split up with the boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should want a future with the guy and do not need a relationship right now.	labels:It has to be your decision but I think you will know if you've made the right one..
text:I really appreciate it. The seeker feels less emotional about her relationship situation. The supporter could ask for more details about what the relationship is.	labels:I hope that I have been able to give you some good advice and that you feel a little clearer about things now..
text:Yes, this has helped tremendously. The seeker feels a lot better about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that it was not fair to break up with her boyfriend. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she should think where the break up was.	labels:Thank you for that .. I am glad to have been on assistance. I wish you all the very best in your future, wherever it takes you..
text:I appreciate all of your feedback too. It has helped put my mind to rest. The seeker felt relieved and relieved of the worry about break up. The supporter could comment on how the seeker feels relieved.	labels:Thank you and best wishes!.

text:Hi! How are you tonight?\nI've been better. I just buried my dog yesterday. She was going to turn 15 next month. The seeker feels better. The supporter could tell the seeker she is having great life experience. The supporter can make sure that the seeker does not feel that the life is not good or that the supporter is not capable of being the supportee.	labels:Ouch! I'm so sorry to hear that. I never lost a dog, but I've lost cats.. Is 14 a good age for a dog? I have my first dog so I don't know much, he is 9 years old and came with our house..
text:Actually, yes. She was old and had dementia. The oldest dog I evet had was 15. The seeker is worried about losing some pets. The supporter could point out that the seeker has very little experience with dogs, but that she is happy to have a dog. The supporter could also point out that the seeker has a lot of friends that love animals. The supporter could also suggest a dog walker.	labels:I'm so sorry, losing a pet is very hard on us..
text:How did your dog come with the house? The seeker feels good about getting a dog. The supporter could tell the seeker to get a dog from a shelter. The supporter could also check with a daycare provider if the seeker only has one child.	labels:Was that your only pet? Or do you have others? We moved from FL to KY and the little dog just hung out here, he really belonged to the neighbor's son who didn't want him, so he just ran around wild and wouldn't leave. I never had a dog, but it got cold, so i took him in. They never asked about him and after a week, I asked them if I could have the dog, so they said yes. I don't think they cared. I wish I could give you a hug, really, there are no words to make this better as you already know the grief of losing a pet, it does get better, but it stings terribly at first.
text:I have 2 other dogs that are mine and my boyfriend has 2. Thank you. that means a lot. We both had dogs when we met. The seeker was struggling to have a dog, but the supporter could remind the seeker of the joy of having a dog.	labels:So you definitely are a dog lover! I was in my 50s before I ever had a dog, now I wish I had more, they are really loving. Not like cats who don't care much about much except FOOD! lol. I know when tragedy happens, I can't get stuck in depression, I sort of have to force myself to put one foot in front of the other. It's hard to have a healthy balance between grieving and continuing to live. Cry, then dry my eyes, pick up, go for a walk, don't get caught in grief, but yet don't deny it!.
text:They get to be so close and you can really pick up on their emotions and stuff. That's what happens to me. I get stuck sometimes. The seeker feels lonely because she does not want to be seen as a dog lover. The supporter should tell the seeker that she would be a great companion for her.	labels:I get stuck too. But you are doing the right things, here you reached out to someone and I do care, so you are moving forward. I always find it helpful just so have someone share my pain with me. Just to know I'm  not alone.
text:Thanks. Another person who has pets helps. They understand. The seeker feels a lot of grief after losing a pet. The supporter could talk to the seeker about what is going on and how she can help the seeker. The supporter could also talk about that pet.	labels:I do understand. My mom died in 2010, right after she died, 1 of my cats died, my husband went into the hospital and almost died, so we went on vacation so I would not be consumed with grief, and do you know, we brought our pets and our cat died when we arrived here on vacation?  I will never forget that. You know what. I knew I could either get consumed in grief, or push through. Man, that was hard. I prayed a lot and God got me through that and I had a good vacation, all things considered. I will definitely pray for you too that God will comfort your heart and that you will be comforted by your other dogs and your boyfriend's dogs and that you will feel joy at times at the happy memories you had with your dog..
text:Oh wow, that sounds horrible. Pushing through though I guess is all one can do then. Thank you so much. I believe in prayer. The seeker feels connected to her other dogs and her boyfriend's dogs. The supporter could tell her to post a picture of her dogs and her boyfriend's dogs, or her boyfriend's dogs and her boyfriend's dogs. The supporter could also ask the seeker to post a photo of her dogs, the supporter could also ask the seeker to post a picture of her dogs, and the supporter could also ask the seeker to post a picture of her dogs and her boyfriend's dogs.	labels:Prayer is what gets me through every day!  :D  It was rough, but I believe these hard times strengthen us in some way. Because life throws hard balls, and we have to move forward or be consumed..
text:That's true. I'm glad I did this project. You really helped me. The seeker realizes the support really does care and is concerned about her situation. The supporter could have encouraged the seeker to keep trying to work on her fondness for pets.	labels:I'm so glad I did too. It was a pleasure to meet you. And once again, (hug). :D.
text:You too. Thanks so much. bye. The seeker is happy, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask regarding the reason.	labels:I have one more thing to say - wise words from this 92 year old lady at church named Sue. She told me this after my brother died. When you get older, everyone you know is practically dead.  She said "Life is for the living, if you get caught up to much in all the death, you won't life."  True words. God bless, have a good night. .	episode_done:True

text:yes my wife, and she is supportive either way so that's not a problem. The seeker feels anxious about losing benefits. The supporter could have a chat with the seeker to find out more about benefits and the reasons why she feels anxious.

What is your current line of work?.

The supporter could suggest to ask for a job offer from walmart.	labels:Online work can be very lucrative. I have been doing it for years personally. It is nice to be your own boss and choose your own hours..
text:I currently do day trading on the side and make great money at it but want something stable to challenge me. The seeker feels right at home in line with the supporter. The supporter could say that the seeker is a sales manager and can also teach the seeker to do day trading.	labels:It is true that stability is important. Do I hear you say that you are frightened of the insecurity of working from home?.
text:more so the lack of benefits I would lose, especially healthcare. The seeker wants stability, but does not want to lose benefits. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is worried about being without health insurance, but that it is better than not having it.	labels:Ah .. I am in the UK so we have socialised medicine :). Would you feel more comfortable if you lived in a country like that?.
text:lol definitely! Currently I pay $750 monthly if I purchase healthcare on my own but only $163 monthly through my work. The seeker is frightened to leave home and does not have insurance. The supporter could suggest to do the same.	labels:Goodness .. I do not have to pay anything. Also our prescriptions are fixed at about ten pounds each.. I think maybe your job dilemma would be easier if you moved to a different country :D .
text:I would lose about $3000 monthly leaving my job. The seeker is unsure of the benefits of working alone. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a job with a national healthcare provider and access treatment when they are sick.	labels:You might be able to make that much from home though. And what's life if you don't take the odd risk?.
text:still there? The seeker was asked if she is afraid of not taking the risk. The supporter could suggest that she take a risk.	labels:Yes I am :). Is there anything else that you'd like to talk about ?. I hope I have been able to be of some help to you :).	episode_done:True

text:I just found out this morning. I'm not sure what to do. The seeker is sad and does not know what to do. It does not sound like the supporter is going to be able to help her. The supporter should try to help her in this conversation.	labels:that sucks, did you tell your family?
text:Yeah i told them. they just aren't in a position to help me. The seeker asks the supporter to find out her family. The supporter could also find out her friends' names, if they are a mentor.	labels:it's ok even if they can't really help, having someone to share your problem is good enough.
text:Thats true. I still feel pretty sad about it. The seeker has found the right support person. The supporter could tell the seeker to get a job. The supporter could also tell the seeker that they can start studying now.	labels:Of course, anyone would feel the same. Maybe you should take a short trip, camping or go fishing to clear your mind for now.
text:That's a great idea! I think i'll do that now. Should I invite people? The seeker wants to go to camping or fishing. The supporter could suggest to invite friends and family. The supporter could also suggest to speak to man on the road and have a talk with him. The supporter could tell the seeker that her friends and family are struggling.	labels:I think after you feel calmer then you can look for job.

text:Hi there, how is life treating you right now?.\nOh, not too bad, thanks.  And you? The seeker was in a good mood. The supporter should praise her for her positive mood.	labels:I am okay but feeling a little down at the moment. Is there anything that you'd like to talk about?.

The seeker has been having a problem with a close friend. The supporter could ask the seeker to find a therapist to talk about the problem.	labels:Thank you, I would like to be able to help you but do not know what the problem is right now.
text:I have this friend who is now on the opposite coast. We were out of touch for 15 years, but recently reconnected. We've been texting. But now he's demanding an apology, and it's completely unreasonable... The seeker feels anxious and thinks that she should be able to get the apology.

text:No, not at all. It's new stuff. The seeker feels pressured to apologize. The supporter should be able to talk about the issues and bring them up in a positive manner.	labels:Oh I am sorry, I misunderstood. Can you tell me a little about the situation?.

The seeker feels angry and frustrated with the friend because of his jokes, dislikes and insults. The supporter should ask the seeker to forgive the friend.	labels:What is it that he wants you to apologise for?.

I didn't say it like I was challenging him - I just hadn't heard this before. The seeker feels stressed because she did not see the problem with her friend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to fix the text and apologise.	labels:ah I see. I have had problems and sometime negative interactions about Covid with some friends too. I think it's a very difficult time for everybody; we are all feeling the strain and might be more irritable than previously. Can you see any way in which you can work around it and be friends again?
text:Yes - he's always irritable! ha ha. So instead of answering, he launched into this thing about how COVID antibodies disappear, so the tests are pointless. I know there are some issues with the various tests. As it happens, I have a PhD in immunology, so I know a lot about this stuff... Yes - I want to be friends! It's not me... The seeker thinks the friend is causing problems. The supporter could ask if the friend has been having problems with his health or his family.	labels:I think that the tests are very necessary! Also social distancing and mask wearing at this time..
text:He started saying things that are just factually not correct.  I get that the immune system is super complicated, and most people don't know much about it. But when I'd try to explain some things to him, he acted like I couldn't possibly know anything he didn't, after reading one Forbes article, and he started making personal attacks. The seeker feels the stress that started by reading a Forbes article. The supporter should go over the whole conversation and find a way to get the seeker to get over the stress.	labels:I think that perhaps you do not need this toxic person in your life. After fifteen years without him do you really feel you need to stay r reconciled?.

The seeker feels angry at the supporter because he had not told her about the, oh so important, thing. The supporter could answer her by telling her that he has been friends with her for some time and that he just happened to be friends now.	labels:In that case perhaps you can just agree to disagree on this topic? If you don't want to risk the friendship :). I hope I have been able to be of some help to you today and thank you for talking!.
text:And I'm also hurt and annoyed that he thinks I have anything to apologize for, when I put up with his acid tongued comments, and just turn the other cheek. I agree we should just go on, but I'm not going to apologize, when I didn't do anything. Anyway - yes. I agree with you.  Thanks for the talk. Take care! The seeker feels hurt that the friend disrespects her and does not want to talk about the topic. The supporter could ask the seeker to take a little break from the conversation.	labels:And you too!.

The supporter could also tell the seeker to read something to help her re-energize.	labels:She seems to be a bit immature, amazon tasks even if not your main income, is still income and you're just working to make your life better.
text:Exactly, and I was completing online chatbot tasks to get her a gift when she broke it off. It really came as a surprise to me. The seeker feels insecure about her girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to make sure she has a good relationship with her girlfriend. The supporter could also tell the seeker to discuss about the break up with her girlfriend with friends and family.	labels:that sucks, it must be shocking for you. Did you try to explain to her?
text:I did try to explain, but she didn't give me much of an opportunity to. She said that I was just wasting my time because you can only redeem the money in Amazon.com gift cards. And since I live in the UK, i'd have to pay £12 shipping just to get anything delivered. The seeker was confused by the amount of money that she was spending on Amazon, but the situation was not discussed. The supporter could have asked the seeker to think about the situation.	labels:ah it is your thought that counts, I'm sorry she didn't appreciate your effort. But you know what, she might just  not be the right one, a better partner would understand and even be moved by the fact you work so hard to give her a gift.
text:Maybe you're right. She made fantastic hot chocolate though, and i'm really going to miss that.

Will you work your way through?.
text:I would like to study Economics ideally, and will work as hard as I can since it's very competitive. The seeker does not have a specific goal for education, but only wants to find a job.

I felt much the same way back when I was in college. My parents paid my way through school, and even got me to pursue a major that I had no interest in.

Since they are a non-profit, I'm sure they would want to do everything to help you with your financial situation.

text:I have been struggling for motivation to do anything the past couple weeks.  This is a really hard time of year for me.  I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year.  We were very close.  I was 17 at the time.  Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life.  Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident.  I dread the holidays. . The seeker posted to a friend on Facebook saying that she is struggling with motivation. The supporter should chat with the seeker and ask for more details about the cause for her struggles.	labels:Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?
text:You are exactly right.  The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner.  She died 4 days later on Dec 29th.  And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year.  He died on Jan 3rd.. I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year.  This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them.  I have even bought one christmas present. The seeker feels depressed about Christmas because of her loss of boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to the hospital or visit a counselor or focus on the holidays.	labels:I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?
text:My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close.  He is alot younger than me.  We just never had the connection like his sister and I did.  And both my grandparents have passed away.  Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now. My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same. . The seeker is trying to share and not hide the feelings of loss. The supporter should put the seeker in a sincere frame of mind to forgive and move on.	labels:I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives.. Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?
text:They say it gets easier. And I agree it does.  Things just have changed so much.  I miss how life was before I lost them. The seeker feels joy at seeing joy in someone's face when they receive a gift. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a face painting.	labels:I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company..
text:I love giving gifts.  And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give.  My nieces and nephews can't wait every year to see what I got them. . The seeker does not feel joy from gifts. The supporter could suggest the seeker to switch to giving more of a gift.	labels:That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year..
text:This year I am tie dying hooded sweatshirts.  I make tshirts for a hobby.  And to tell you the truth thats the only gifts I have gotten so far.  My oldest daughter turned 18 this year and lives with her boyfriend so its just me and my 15 year old daughter.  She struggles with depression/anxiety as well.  Her dad has been in jail for some stupid actions since August.  She has had to deal with him being an addict pretty much her whole life.  I think we are both missing how the holidays were with her sister still living at home.  Too much change in our lives in such a little time frame. The seeker is thinking about spending time with nieces and nephews, but they don't live near her home. The supporter could suggest that her nieces and nephews are close, or that the seeker could try to find a way to spend some time with them.	labels:Wow, what a great gift idea! That is a solid start on your gifts for the season, and something to be proud of..
text:They will love them.  A couple years ago I put their names on fleece blankets when I worked at an embroidery shop.  They absolutly loved them! The seeker feels her relationship with her partner changes when she loses her partner. The supporter could tell the seeker that everyone she loves has a partner.	labels:And I see, it sounds like the changes in your life are potentially impacting your daughter as well. However, I'm glad you have each other for support this season. This year has been crazy for many reasons, and many people tend to find comfort in routines or traditions. Do you and your daughters have any holiday traditions you typically complete? Awesome gift idea! Personalized gifts are always so heartfelt and appreciated. Good thinking!	episode_done:True

text:Extremely hard.  I remember that morning like it was yesterday.  He got killed within an hour after leaving the house on his way to work. The seeker has lost her boyfriend to car accident. The supporter could tell the seeker that is a terrible thing to happen and is a terrible thing to do.	labels:He was killed so soon after you last saw him?.
text:Very soon.  And the worst thing is I was upset with him that morning.  He had an addiction to xanax.  I was not ok with it.  He had went and got some that morning and he would always give them to me so I could give them to him so he didn't take them all.  I was so upset that he went and got them.  He was packing up his truck with things to take to the new shop that day.  He was a tattoo artist and just started a new job.  I didn't even get out of bed to help him and he knew I was upset with him. The seeker has a bad day. The supporter should offer her support by doing a hug and saying: "I'm sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry to hear that.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  I'm so sorry to hear that."	labels:Have you considered any sort of bereavement counselling? Addiction in a partner is a very hard thing to have to deal with. It is not your fault!.
text:I had decided that I was gonna wait to hear from him that day instead of texting or calling him.  I wanted him to realize how upset his addiction made me. Instead the phone call I got was that he had been killed. The seeker has not talked about bereavement counselling. The supporter could tell the seeker that the distance in time between the two is an issue. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker could talk to a counsellor.	labels:Do you feel any sort of guilt about it? You should not, of course, but do you wonder if things would have been different if you had talked to him first?
text:I haven't done any counseling.  I know I should and it would probably help me.  I don't know why I have not. . The seeker feels guilty because he did not talk to his boyfriend first. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should be more careful about what she gets in therapy.

The seeker feels guilty that she spent the whole day with her boyfriend and did not call him. The supporter could ask the seeker to describe their last conversation.	labels:Are you still in touch with his family and friends?
text:I went and talked to a therapist once right after and never went back.  And I don't know why.  He was amazing to talk too.  But I just never went back. The seeker was upset by her boyfriend's death. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can be in a better mood and focus on the things that she has been struggling with.	labels:I think you should do things in your own time but I would recommend doing it again one day..
text:I don't have any contact with his family.  I actually had to block them on all social media.  They are extremely religous.  Which there is nothing wrong with that.  But he didn't have the best relationship with any of them.  They couldn't accept him for who he was.  His biological father didn't have anything to do with him.  His mom was remarried and had two more kids and they didn't treat my boyfriend very good growing up.  He ended up living with his grandparents.  He finally had acceptance in my family.  He actually talked to my mom more than I did lol. The seeker feels guilt that she did not tell her boyfriend or her parents about his addiction. The supporter should suggest that she could tell her parents about it, but she could not because it was her boyfriends fault.	labels:Sounds like a very complicated set up. It is sad when family members become partially estranged from one another..
text:His family has been pretty horrible to me and my girls.  And I know it's because they have guilt for the way things were with their relationship.  They didn't even invite me and my girls to the burial of his ashes. . The seeker understands that there is guilt in the relationship with her boyfriend and her family. The supporter could tell the seeker that her family is also very difficult to deal with. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to find a therapist to help her deal with her family.	labels:That is extremely offensive and I think you would have had the right to contest that..

text:We weren't married. And of course he didn't have a will.  He was only 32.  So according to his family I have no legal rights. Thank you for chatting with me. .

The supporter could say she needs to work on her background to be successful.	labels:I understand your frustration, I had a discussion a few days ago about this.

text:Hello, how may i help you today?\nHello: Thanks for offering to help.  My friend Mark is suffering from bi-polar disorder, and despite being on medication, is spiraling out of control. His mood swings are affecting his ability to stay employed and keep friends and family from wanting to interact with him. The seeker should tell the supporter about her friend's bi-polar disorder. The supporter should also say that the seeker's friend is also in a high stress position.	labels:I am so sorry about your friend mark. I will try my best to help you today. Is your friend mark behavior affecting you?
text:I suspect he's not taking his medication as prescribed.  He's become a sociopath, which I understand is common with people suffering from this disorder.  He's unable to be empathic or sympathetic to anyone else's life. The seeker sees "sociopath" and "bipolar disorder". The supporter could talk to the seeker about the dangers of bi-polar disorder. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should visit a psychiatrist and ask what the symptoms are. This will help the seeker understand bi-polar disorder and how they can be helped.	labels:To confirm your friend mark, you suspect he is not taking his medicine and that is why he is acting the way he is?
text:Yes, it is affecting me.  In sum, I'm the only one left in his corner, but I feel like he's slipping away and becoming completely dysfunctional.  It's tough with privacy laws for me to even talk to his doctor to see what's going on.  I did send his doctor a long email, however, so hopefully he'll make whatever adjustments need to be made. That's my suspicion, because things seem to be getting worse, quite honestly. The seeker feels like she has to be in control of her life to get anything done. The supporter can reassure the seeker that she is not alone in this situation. The supporter can also give her some advice for dealing with problems. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should not be in isolation.	labels:Have you talked to mark about his behavior and how it is affecting everyone around him? I can understand how you feeling and that you are trying to help your friend. you are a very good friend for doing that.
text:I have talked to him repeatedly.  Each time, he assures me that he understands my concerns and that he's going to get things together.  Literally, within a day or two, I hear from a mutual friend or family member that he's reverted back to doing things that are sociopathic. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should avoid giving the seeker an answer to the questions.	labels:Have you asked him about him taking his medication?
text:I have.  He tells me that he's taking it regularly (or most of the time).  I challenged him on it and told him it can't be "most of the time."  That's why I sent his doctor a long email, explaining things to him, to see if he can't intervene and try to straighten him out. The seeker feels scared about the lack of communication between him and his friend. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to friends and family.	labels:ok. dealing with someone with bi-polar disorder can be really tough and challenging but it is not there fault that they are acting the way they are. They just honestly can not help it. I know you are doing everything you can to help him and to stop him from acting that way.
text:You're right.  Mental illness, in all of its forms, is especially challenging.  Physical illness is more easy to understand, of course. . The seeker felt that the support was dealing with someone who is bi-polar disorder. The supporter could provide some help to the seeker by talking to friends and family members and provide some support to the seeker. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to a therapist.	labels:you are right. So do not think he is doing it on purpose. Do not let it bring you down or hurt your feelings in anyway. When did this exactly start happening?
text:Thank you.  I think you understand the sadness and anxiety in feeling powerless in this situation (or mostly powerless).  I have no real expertise in this area, but by contacting his doctor, maybe he can reevaluate whether the medicine and dosage needs to be changed. Funny you ask.  He's a grown man - 35-years old.  I've never known him to have this issue, which seems so strange to me. The seeker was crying. The supporter could try to comfort her and answer her thoughts of powerlessness.	labels:I understand a lot..
text:It started about 14 months ago - at least that's when people started alerting me to strange behavior.  I thought people who were bi-polar contracted the illness earlier in their life. The seeker wants to reassure the supporter that life is going to be better. The supporter could also suggest to close friend that they would try to help her friend. The supporter could also ask her friend to join an online community and get involved in the community.	labels:How long have you known about his bi polar diorder?
text:Around 10 months ago is when I first found out.  Since then, I've received about 5 phone calls from people expressing concern.  I've visited him 3 times. Thanks for being so engaged and sympathetic.  It does make me feel better just to unload anonymously on here.  Thanks for carrying my burden and offering your support. The seeker feels more like a stranger that she has been feeling before being contacted. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is a stranger and not to worry about her feelings.	labels:i got you. having a mental illness is challenging and i can provide you some suggestions.
text:Before we end the conversation, I'd love hearing a few of those suggestions, if you don't mind. The seeker feels anxious about her job and her health. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing everything she can to help her.	labels:ok. just be there for him no matter what because you know he can not help it. Be understanding of his mental illness. i would be active in his treatment and make sure he knows to take medicine.
text:Thank you.  You've been great.  Have a nice holiday and new year! Those are two things I've tried to keep in mind and you've reinforced my instincts.  Thanks again.

A dear friend of mine is in rehab and had to give up her children, it is really awful to watch. It makes me feel so helpless, so i understand how you msut be feeling..
text:Thanks for being sympathetic and for the words of encouragement.  Yes, needless to say, Child Protective Services were involved, and I was granted Foster Parent status.  I'm sure your friend went down that road, sadly. Have you ever seen the video by the artist known as NF called "How Could You Leave Us?"  I'm afraid that's what's next for these kids. The seeker feels helpless about getting children. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends, relatives and family members and not to take care of family members. The supporter could also tell the seeker to think of ways to help when they feel like they can't.	labels:Yes, she did. Her children seem very lucky to have you. Do they get along with your children? I haven't seen that, waht happens in it?
text:They all get along famously.   You can find that video on YouTube.  It's a true story of how his mother died from heroin addiction.  It's a powerful song. Hopefully, you never have to experience it.  Heroin (opioids) just grabs hold of people and doesn't let go. The seeker feels lucky to have a friend that is taking care of her children, and a friend that is taking care of her children. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has such a good friend.	labels:That's so awful. the only thing you can do is show the kids love and make them feel cared for.. Addiction is a truly awful disease, people don't appreciate the toll it takes on families..
text:Thank you.  One piece of good news.  Her son went from failing most of his classes to making Honor Roll this trimester - that's what his advisor tells me. . You've been really helpful and considerate.  Chatting with you certainly made me feel better.  I think we can end the support session at this juncture if you've met your session requirements. The seeker is cheered up. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is confident in her job. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she is a good candidate for therapy.	labels:That's so good!!!

The kicker is that we live together and her family is planning on coming to stay with us for xmas. they already have their flights booked and now are trying to cancel. The seeker is saddened by the breakup. The supporter should try to help the seeker through the breakup.	labels:So from what I am hearing, you ended things with your girlfriend because she was talking to her ex and lying to you about it and you are feeling upset about it.
text:yeah, plus our relationship has been rocky for the past year. I think we are just loosing interest in eachother. The seeker feels upset because she is feeling bad about telling her girlfriend she was lying to her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to her girlfriend about the situation and her feelings. The supporter could also suggest to the seeker to open up, be honest and to make a good friendships.	labels:I understand your situation completely. I had a recent ex that I lived with who also was talking to her ex and hanging out with him and lying to me about it.
text:what did you do about it? The seeker feels bad because of the infidelity. The supporter could offer some advice to the seeker to stop the infidelity.	labels:The first thing I did was had a conversation to try and see why she was talking to her ex and lying to me about it. Trying to get closure is very helpful.
text:yes, i could see that. We have discussed and decided to end things. Like I said, her family was planning on staying with us for xmas, so now it feels like we ruined xmas for everyone. The seeker feels hurt and upset when her friend is lying to her.

text:i agree, i just hope her family doesn't come out. She still needs to move out but I'm hoping her family doesn't come out to help her move. Or at least gives me a heads up so i can stay in a hotel while she moves out. The seeker feels stressed and worried about moving out of her boyfriend's house because her boyfriend is moving out. The supporter should give the seeker a chance to move out before she moves into the supporter's house. The supporter could also create a friendship for the seeker to help her move out of the supporter's house.	labels:I can understand your anxiety over that.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Are you able to see my situation I typed? Is there someone there? The seeker feels like a burden to the supporter. The supporter should notice how the seeker feels.	labels:Sorry I'm here, please tell me you problems.
text:Just having problems with some friends. I feel like I am being left out. The seeker feels left out because she feels left out of the conversation. The supporter could say this to the seeker: When you are being left out do not feel like you are being left out.	labels:Why do you think that way?
text:They leave me out of planned outings from time to time. They also do not seem to care if I come or go when I am invited. The seeker feels left out because of the friends she does not get to see.

Would you be willing to see my problems and see if you can help me?"	labels:Have you asked your friends regarding this?
text:I have not. The seeker does not feel like she is being left out. It is not in her best interest to feel left out. The supporter could give the seeker a hint of how to get her back.	labels:Okay, maybe you should ask your friends, let them know how you feel and see what they say about it.
text:Okay, I may try that. What do you think I should do if they are negatively receptive of it? The seeker feels that she is being left out of group events, but her friends are not appreciative of her feelings. The supporter could suggest that the seeker do something like go to the library, visit a friend, or something else.	labels:Under any circumstances, make sure you know you are not at wrong here.I hope it will not be the case but your friends might try victim blaming. So keep your stance and keep asking for the answer.
text:Yeah, I don't want it to come off as an attack on my end. Maybe I should wait, see if the issue occurs continuously, note that it has been observed on multiple occasions, and then stand my ground? The seeker does not want to stand on the wrong side of attacks. The supporter should tell the seeker to ask for more details.	labels:I'm pretty this has happened a few times already, hasn't it? so you have every right to be upset and confront them, you shouldn't feel like you're attacking. You are just asking for what you deserve.
text:Yes, but I feel like I need proof, you know? Like how you previously said, to make sure I am not in the wrong. That's true! The seeker feels that she needs proof by the supporter. The supporter could ask the seeker to send a note to her friends.	labels:What you need to do is note down the occasions where they exclude you and ask exactly what happened then.
text:Okay makes sense. Then, I can ask like, was there a reason why I was not invited on this instance? Did I do anything to offend, etc. The seeker was upset about being excluded from the events planned for this afternoon. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on what she does not have in the way of a get out of jail free card.	labels:Yes, that's good, ask them if you did something that offended them and why they excluded you. If they deny, then you can tell them how you feel. If they care about your friendship they will do something to fix.
text:That is good advice. What is your advice if I still come out of the situation negatively (e.g. the friends do not seem to care about the friendship?) The seeker feels like they need to prove they are doing something wrong. The supporter can give them the answer they need.	labels:honestly, I think you also know that if you care about someone and they feel upset, you'll do everything you can to help the situation.

You know. the end of the year is coming up and it's probably not the best time to leave a job without having anything lined up..
text:Yeah, I've been applying around a bit.. The seeker sounds frustrated she does not have a clear exit strategy. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to someone that knows what she is going through. The supporter could also ask how to deal with her.	labels:that's good! I think budgets are going to be tight in many industries and you need to make sure you are okay financially and have insurance and unfortuantely both of those are tied to employers..
text:I know... This pandemic is frustrating. I wish I could just walk out but realistically It'd be pretty irresponsible to quit during a global pandemic and not have insurance.. The seeker feels stressed because of plans to leave the job. The supporter could help the seeker by reminding her that she will not be leaving the job until the end of the year. The supporter could then ask the seeker to tell a friend or family member to reach out to them and tell them what happened.	labels:That's a good point. I suggest continuing to look and see what you can find. There will be people hiring..
text:yeah thanks. I'm still so mad but maybe I can redirect my energy into finding an new job. The seeker feels that her job situation is stressful.

I am scared for everyone out here anymore and its not just people getting sick and ill, but people like you who could be in jeopardy of loosing their job or their source of income. That's is something that would be on anyones mind, more yours then mine due to you actually working in the public.

The supporter should tell the seeker the lock down situation is going to get worse and that is something that is on the visitors minds.	labels:We thankfully have not got on lockdown just yet, but I know it will be happening soon. We live in a very small town and it has got bad here that either we know someone who has it, or someone in the family has it.

I know its hard and stressful to search and look for things like that but trust me it will take a lot of stress off your mind.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to make a movie night with her children, or even watch a Netflix movie.	labels:I completely understand.

Even trying these things will cause a smile and a fun time for those moments that will make every one happy and not think about covid, because they will all be thinking about how much fun they are having with you and the family, and that will help with the stress even if its just a little bit.	episode_done:True

He had to get sober and look at what he was doing.. There is a hard line between helping a friend who is addicted and actually enabling them. Have you ever heard of this?

We are retired now, but still volunteer. Sometimes we have to let go of our loved ones - they have to hit rock bottom. Very hard to do, but unless they see their behavior as destructive, they don't want to change..
text:I agree, I'm afraid that's what I have to do. Another one of our mutual friends passed away recently to an overdose. I don't want to lose another friend. The seeker feels sad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker about the reason for the seeker's sadness.	labels:Have you seen the serenity prayer?

The supporter should ask the seeker to forgive her friend.	labels:It's very hard to lose friends to addictions. It's epidemic in our society now. However, you can pray for them and look for ways to keep your life on track so you don't get lost focusing on them and not where you want to go..
text:all drugs are bad, but meth is a truly evil drug. It's just rotting his soul and body.  He believes he can't stop and you're right, letting go and just sending prayers is all i can really do now. The seeker does not feel like she does anything wrong. The supporter could mention that meth is an addiction and ask her questions.	labels:very evil, I agree, I like to write out a list of things I can do to distract myself from overly being concerned, if that makes sense. Like I take time to think about them and pray for them, then I have to move on with my life, so a list helps me think of where I want to go and how to get there. Even if it is just a list of how to clean my pantry! lol. My husband just got me a daytimer, and I write my goals in that for the new year, and I try to check it every day and try to focus on moving forward, because life has a way of throwing us curveballs like this, and we can't get stuck in them..
text:That's a good idea.  I don't have many friends left, close friends that is, and this guy is my best friend of 20 years. We were in a touring rock band together.  He's my last close friend. The seeker feels lost and confused about her friends. The supporter could suggest the seeker to check out the serenity prayer.	labels:It is hard to lose friends that we have had for years. Maybe you can write that on your list -- perhaps just brainstorm ways to make new friends - take a college class, join a gym, take a dance class, volunteer at church, something like that. That way you open up yourself to make new friends.. I have had to walk away from many unhealthy relationships over the years, it isn't easy, but it's part of maturing in life..
text:I'm a single dad so my world is my children. I guess that's enough for me really. I just watch this guy sink and often feel like I should be doing something, but I think you're right. The seeker feels lonely and worried about making new friends. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to online for help.	labels:I've learned the hard way, if a person doesn't want to change, I'm just beating my head against a wall.

text:I split with my girlfriend after 5 years together last month/ The seeker feels estranged from her girlfriend and is worried about it.

The seeker feels upset, upset because of the breakup. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk to her friends and see if they have similar experiences or that there is a support group.	labels:Getting over a breakup will take time? Have you ever heard of DABDA? Denial (I can't believe this happened!) Anger (we all know that) Bargaining (If only I had done that, or if only - trying to make it FEEL better by imagining other scenarios - doesn't really work) Depression - sadness, then Acceptance -- we go in and out of these emotions and sometimes it can make us feel crazy, but all of them are normal in varying degrees and we don't know when they will happen..
text:No, but those sound like the typical stages of grief. I guess I'm in anger. I have no interest in barbagining. The seeker is worried that he has a difficult time cancelling his work. The supporter could suggest the seeker to start preparing by doing a study session or working with a friend.	labels:I would make a list of things you have always wanted to do and then just BRAINSTORM any idea, no idea is too out there -- learn to ice skate, learn to play the ukulele, sign up for dance lessons, join the gym, go to a singles group at church, visit the elderly, volunteer somewhere..
text:I think I need to focus on exercise. Just get my body and mind healthy and full of energy. What do you think? The seeker feels depressed, angry, sad and unclear about what to do.	labels:I also find it helpful not only to limit how much I dwell on my pain, but make sure I reach out to help someone else. I will tell you, that is the secret to happiness. Maybe help a neighbor with groceries or hanging lights. Old people (me) love help, bake something or call your aunt or uncle.
text:True, but it's hard not to dwell. It's not like I have a choice. It overcomes me. The seeker helps a neighbor in an effort to help someone else. The supporter should have a list of what they are doing to help. The seeker could also thank the supporter for helping. The supporter could recommend a friend with a similar goal.	labels:I agree, get healthy and try to help others. One thing about feelings is that if you change your mind, you can change your feelings, it might happen slowly, but if you put your mind off of it, it will help. Not saying NEVER feel the emotions, but feelings are the tail of the dog, not the dog itself, You do not have to be ruled by them. You don not have to FEEL like going for a walk to go for a walk.
text:It's hard not to just drown myself in booze and cannabis. The seeker feels sadness and is worried about the lack of exercise.

The supporter could encourage the seeker to get work, volunteer, or help someone else. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker could get a job or volunteer.	labels:I understand, but those are choices that really, long term, are not for your benefit. Her cheating was a reflection on HER bad character, not yours. You have to love yourself and try to fight this..
text:Are you Ai or a human mturker? The seeker 's response is to she says that she is a human mturker and says her character is bad. She then says, "I had a boyfriend before I take off". The supporter should keep asking questions and try to understand what happened and what the seeker is going through.	labels:I'm a human. I live in KY, retired counselor! hhahaha I prayed for someone to encourage.

The supporter could tell the seeker to try to be a better person to her friend.	labels:I'm from the city, so there isn't much to do on a farm in the middle of cold weather. I have been through a lot of breakups, so I know what works, and yes, I was cheated on, devastating. But you can overcome this. Make that list and do NOT let your feelings rule your life. You can recover and find someone worthy of your love and care.
text:Thanks so much!!! I really appreciate it! :) The seeker is happy because she knows that she can heal her feelings. The supporter could also tell her to start a support group or read books and read other people's stories.	labels:The WORST breakup came a year before I met my husband. in retrospect, it was the best thing, listen,you could have married this girl, count your blessings. cheating is just terribly destructive.

text:Me and my manager. She feels that we are targeting her. The seeker felt harassed by the coworker and doesn't know why. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to stop the harassment and get into productive relationships.	labels:That's unfortunately. Have you talked to someone in upper management about this?
text:I have talked to him about past issues with her but not this most recent. I'm trying to give myself some time to talk to him because I'm still very angry and don't want to talk with so much emotion. The seeker feels stressed because of the coworker. It is unclear what the supporter can do to help the seeker.	labels:That is understandable. People can be hard to deal with at times. What did the co-worker do that upset you?
text:We have a set process of how we are to screen employees as they enter the workplace.  She doesn't follow the procedures or makes up her own way to do them because she is lazy to either stand up or greet them.  She is also rude at times to customers and has an attitude that is not friendly. . The seeker has not seen the co-worker in this job. The supporter could include other people in the search.	labels:Oh, that's unfortunate. Have you brought this issue to upper management in the past?.
text:I have and so my manager sent a general memo reminding employees about our standard operating procedures.  And from that memo, she thinks it's only about her and that we are discriminating against her. The seeker feels like a landmine is being thrown into her body by the co-worker. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to upper management about the harassment and make sure that she does not impede the progress of the investigation. In the meantime, the supporter could tell the seeker that you will be doing your best to find a way to get her fired.	labels:Sorry to hear. Has upper management done anything about this issue?
text:I haven't taken it past my immediate manager but I may have to at this point if she is looking to file a grievance or submit a statement that we are discriminating her. The seeker is trying to convince the supporter to do something about the issue. The supporter could tell the seeker that there is nothing to do about this.	labels:Well, in my opinion, I think you did the right thing. Has anyone else mentioned her rudeness in the past?
text:Thank you.  Yes others that have worked with her share say the same thing about her rudeness and laziness on the job.  I am probably going to submit some kind of report or statement to upper management. . The seeker wants to report rude to upper management. The supporter should encourage the seeker to move forward with the investigation.	labels:I was wondering, how long has she been an employee at your work?
text:I'm just unsure because I have not documented the  incidents that I have had with her.. She's been employee for approximately 5 months. The seeker is apologetic about her past issues with coworkers. The supporter can recommend to make a report or to contact upper management.	labels:No, I think you did the right thing. Wow, 5 month and she's still there.

text:I'm looking for support in regards to a recent break up. My boyfriend/fiance seems to be a serial and or chronic masturbator. When I looked at his files in his computer it was shocking! Are you there? I am seeking some support in this crazy world? The thing is that his files contained really gross porn and live webcam sites. What should I do? When I confronted him he said it was not him! He lied so horribly! I am heartbroken. I also found out that he has had many different profiles on facebook that are just covert operations. What would you think? Please tell me what advice you would give? His spam folder is full of crap! all of it like Fuck me here and now!. Hello there are you there? The seeker has been told it is not the person, but something else. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are other people on the internet that are doing similar things. The supporter could suggest some ways to be more careful with that information.	labels:sorry i'm here.
text:I have checked his email folders and we have talked about his over the top usage of porn and online dating sites. He has admitted that he is in fact a sex addict! Should I hold on or should I let it go? Just find someone else that I can actually trust? The seeker knew the supporter would be here to help. The supporter could tell the seeker something about the porn and online dating sites.	labels:First of all, I have a fre questions to ask. Does the idea of him being sex addict change how you feel about him?
text:What's the fre question? what is fre? Not necessarily . Just the trust issue really. The seeker heard about sex addict. The supporter may ask for more details.	labels:I would say you should cut tie with him. Being  into porn is a serious issue but what's more important is he lied to you about that.
text:We've known each other for years and have been friends for a very long time.. We dated on and off and things just seem to always go back to this weird off place. The seeker has been friends for a long time, but the seeker is not trusting the supporter.

text:I appreciate your thoughts. So you don't think I should give him another chance? The seeker felt hurt by him taking part in porn. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should "cut" ties with him.	labels:This is a wake up call for you I must say, to get away from him. I think you should sit down and tell him to take a break, this doesn't mean completely break up but some time for both of you to think it over.

The supporter could also lead the seeker to a few porn sites that have good content.	labels:That's why you need some time for yourself to think whether you can forgive him and try to help him or not.
text:I know . That sounds like great advice. Hard to pull off during the pandemic though. The seeker feels depressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:To be honest, watching porn is normal, however, I feel that if someone is too into it, as in watch it more than 1-2 times a month, it's problematic and won't be easy to fix. Do you live with him?

The supporter could also remind the seeker that she's an adult, and she has experienced this before.	labels:That you have to ask him, tell him to have an honest thought, no judgement, be completely honest with each other.
text:He laughs when I show him mens underwear. I think maybe that's a sign he's uncomfortable. What do you think? The seeker is worried that he might be gay? The supporter could say that he is not really sure.	labels:Yeah, laughs can definitely be a sign of someone getting nervous. Does he have any close male friends?
text:Yep That's what I thought too. He does have a few close male friends. Nothing that looks suspicious though. The seeker feels nervous, but the supporter can tell that the seeker is not sure what to do, but the supporter can also tell the seeker that they think they can help.	labels:Whether he's gay or not, it's hard to say just from a few things, but what's more important right now is for you two to sit down and talk.
text:I wonder if there is a way to find out why he joined all of these weird servers and is trying to learn code. Is it really for 3d printing or is it to make a secret platform to hide his data etc? The seeker feels worried about having to deal with someone who is into 3d printing, and is worried about the possibility of someone being gay having sex with someone else. The supporter could give the seeker a list of websites that are safe for him to use.

The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk to friends.	labels:Great, the sooner the better. I have a feeling you'll both be relieved when you do.
text:I agree! I don't know if it's something she's considered, because I've expressed interest in moving to the northwest just for fun, but I've also noted that the schools I'm actually looking at are Arizona and New Mexico. I do think the field she wants to go into could be applicable in almost any state, but I'll be gentle. I don't want to lose her, so if I need to look into a different section of my field, I definitely could. The seeker is able to hear the support and the supporter is able to clarify the meaning of her words. The supporter can also tell the seeker that moving to the south would be beneficial to the seeker.	labels:I'm sure she's considered it, expressing interest in both of those areas could just be that you're sending mixed messages too. So really, just talking it out is your best bet. Good luck!	episode_done:True

text:Do you have any pets? The seeker feels lonely and worried about dogs. The supporter could say that she has lots of dogs and some dogs are nice. The supporter could also say that she has a dog that is very loyal.	labels:Dogs bring so much love and support. What a great idea. This can prove to be very helpful with feelings of loneliness.. Not at the moment. I have alot of animals running around my home that I feed everyday. I mean outside critters. I did just have a jack Russell. She was the smartest dog I have ever had and I have had several. What kind of dog are you thinking of getting ?
text:Corgi, thoughts? The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a pet to make the seeker feel more connected.	labels:Those use dogs are super smart as well. I think that's a great choice..

I believe its all about the way you look at situations. This is time for self care.	episode_done:True
text:hi there, how are you and how can i help?\nhey! not too bad but like i said. im going into university and my parents want to me to do architecture. when im really into engineering. money is a large factor so- The seeker does not provide any information about the support. The supporter should offer her own advice anyway.	labels:i see. are your parents paying for your university?
text:well money as in like salaries later on. tuition fees aren't an issue im in canada and all. but like architects generally make more money than mechanical engineers on average. so they don't approve my career path. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not given. The supporter should ask the seeker what the reason is.	labels:oh i see. so you mean that your parents would prefer you to choose the path that will eventually give you a higher salary?
text:yeah exactly! but i don't like architecture very much, i don't find myself fond of art. The seeker feels stressed because she doesn't like architecture. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should search for other work.	labels:that is a tough situation. it's definitely not easy to go against your family's wishes, but at the same time you have to do what's best for you.
text:well what's best for me is literally a good salary because i'd be lying if money isn't an issue. but am i going to be happy later on doing the job? The seeker feels desperate for a good salary. The supporter could tell the seeker that her parents are worried about her career choice. The supporter could also suggest that if the seeker is so anxious about her salary, she could consider taking an engineering course.	labels:i went through a similar experience during my schooling, and i had to explain to my parents that i don't want to disappoint them but i still have to do what makes me happy. having a career that you hate doesn't feel good - i've been there. but there can be careers in engineering that have connections to architecture as well, such as structural engineering.
text:yeah i agree. it's much more suitable if i could mix up the details of each career paths. but frankly i don't think my parents should be concerned with engineering either. it pays well and provides good stability. but like they said architecture suits my strengths more and i can go further with it. The seeker feels happier with her career choice because she doesn't have to worry about her parents. The supporter could tell the seeker that she doesn't have to worry about her parents, but they do.	labels:honestly i think both are great career paths to pursue and as you said, both are stable and well-paying fields. strengths doesn't always equal happiness though, so that's a tough one. have you considered speaking with both architects and engineers to learn more about each job? that might be helpful in your decision. sometimes what we think a job does, in actuality can be totally different in real life.
text:yeah! i went on reddit to ask students in my desired uni. and they all said that what they are doing is what you expect. architects said it's a booming business in Toronto. engineers is always in demand, but not growing. The seeker is not sure what would be best for her career choice. The supporter should suggest that she is interested in both engineering and architecture.	labels:ah well i commend you on taking that step and actually trying to learn about the jobs. you seem like a really smart person and you're able to see things from a logical perspective.
text:thank you i've done the research to dispute my parents' arguments you see. but like- utimately its about how much i like it o not. *or. The seeker feels that she can do architecture because of her love for it. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should learn about the work.	labels:i think what you need to do is take that same logical approach and explain calmly to your parents the path you want to take. just because they think your strengths are suited for architecture, doesnt mean you don't also have the strengths for engineering. many of the same skills are probably required for both jobs, and you're right: ultimately it is about what will make you happy. and worst case scenario: you can always change careers later if you find that you don't like what you're doing.
text:yeah you are absolutely right. but about the careers path. not sure if you're in canada or not, but it's much harder to switch careers in canada. you pay more and it's not like in the States where you can finish your degree whenever you want right. once you paid. The seeker feels that her dream of learning about architecture is for her to gain a degree in architecture. The supporter could advise her to take private or community colleges to make it easier to find a job.	labels:you sound like a good student and i'm sure your parents must recognize that you're capable of great things, so if you can present to them a logical argument of why you feel engineering is a better path, hopefully they will listen..
text:yeah that is the plan. you're been extremely helpful and im grateful for that. i don't get to share these things very often. my friends are just as busy too you see. But I'll think we can stop it here. The seeker feels stressed and worried about the situation that she is facing.

text:I'm going to miss the people I worked with as well. The seeker feels stressed, but does not mention the reason. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not only worried about the job situation, but also the side work and the reason could be positive.	labels:Unfortunately, this is such an isolating time and losing some of that contact is going to be an adjustment. I can completely understand that.
text:Yes.  it is.  I know that we'll get through this whole thing, but in the meantime it's just so crazy making and anxiety inducing. The seeker is worried about the future and it is difficult to deal with because it is not part of the present. The supporter could ask the seeker to find something positive that she can do in the meantime.	labels:I can definitely relate to that. The amount of anxiety this has all caused is more than I could've ever imagined. The important thing is that we reach out and talk about things in order to help reset and deal with what's going on.
text:For sure, these times are so scary. The seeker has been stressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are many things to do, but this is a challenging time. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get a psychological test.	labels:We'll get through it.  You seem motivated to find a new job which is half the battle. And construction is a good field to be in, everyone needs the services you can provide. Even if temporarily this means finding different things to do to get by.
text:Yes.  it's just being in the middle of it that's frightening. Thank you for talking to me, it's been helpful. The seeker does not want to talk about the project that she is in. The supporter should suggest to the seeker to keep looking for new jobs.	labels:I'm glad we could chat as well.	episode_done:True

I love the outdoors it make you feel free and apart of something much larger than yourself..
text:Absolutely. Since I got back from school I've had time to run around and climb trees and stuff and it makes me feel like a kid again. Are you able to see the details that I wrote at the top of the chat? I think they might only show up for me. The seeker has time to take a break from school. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker go to the library to find a book.	labels:Kool beans ! I love life/outoors just in that same way.. No, I can not see what you sent initially Could you please resend it?..
text:Oh. It asked me to describe the problem I was having. I said that I have had trouble getting over losing a friend who I thought was my best friend for years but eventually I found out he was only acting and he didn't really care about me at all. It's been about a year since he told me that, and whenever I think about it it makes me sad.. I don't know why it's so hard for me to get over it. The seeker said it needs to be relatable. The supporter could remind the seeker that parents often have too hard time getting over losing a child, but that there is never a reason that the child should not be allowed to be with their partner.	labels:Betrayal is a hard pill to swallow. I think you brave for sharing what you have been experiencing. Thank you. We all go through similar situations in all of our lives. Its not about going through those situations it about for me what did  I learn and how will this make me better in the future..
text:I think you're right. What do you think I can learn from it? The seeker feels safe and brave to share what she has been through. She is hopeful that after a while she will be able to make it through the situation.	labels:Those situation sometimes shows us there was time in that friendship where we could have been over extending ourselves. Those are the times we should have been given more love and attention to our self.  We learn how to love ourselves more we others don't reciprocate what we give them. I think it ultimately about being a better friend to you first..
text:I think that's wise, thanks. I was definitely putting too much effort into it and I hardly noticed that he wasn't reciprocating it. I have always had a problem with that. Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Hope you have a good evening. :) The seeker feels betrayed by the friend. The supporter could tell the seeker about the friends past and how he/she was cheating on her/her partner.

When my sisters and I were little, it seemed like everything in the world was so much simpler, and we had certain Christmas traditions that we always looked forward to, like cutting down a tree, making pumpkin pie, and singing carols and Christmas hymns together. As we've gotten older it seems like our family has gotten split apart a bit more and everyone is too stressed and hurried to enjoy the old things that we used to do. That has been pretty hard for me because things used to be so much different. Has that been difficult for you, as well? Just the fact that things are different now than when your kids were little.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker is already getting the work done.	labels:My poor friend, economics in itself is a beast that only unique minds understand.

What are some of the things in your routine during the day?
text:Exactly. Jogging, eating breakfast, getting dressed. The seeker feels guilty about eating breakfast and going to bed. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk about how she eats.	labels:Yep, for me it's kind of felt like working remotely and all the crazy 2020 stuff was kind of an excuse to just "take a break" from grinding. MTurk has kind of helped me get back in a working mindset and given me more energy...have you been doing a lot of MTurk lately?
text:Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I've been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive.

The supporter could also tell the seeker that it is okay to feel guilty about getting up too much and running for a long time. The supporter could also tell the seeker that it is okay to get up and do things when the need arises.	labels:Force yourself at first, then the "body in motion, stays in motion" law will take over. :) All I know, is that nothing is worse than ending a day without a sense of accomplishment and then stringing those kinds of days together..
text:Okay okay. cool. That's a helpful concept. I'm going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that's true. I hate ending the day knowing I've bummed it out. The seeker is unsure about whether she should exercise, and the supporter might suggest that she start doing it.	labels:One of the things I've noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives...you know before it would be like, "I'm looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend." So, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.
text:Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that's out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better.. The seeker feels like she is not getting enough time to relax and do things. The supporter could tell the seeker to get more of a life experience. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get more of a job. She could also tell the seeker to stop being so critical of herself.	labels:I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.
text:I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I'm really in need of some exercise so I'll do that too. I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I'll get back into that too. The seeker is motivated to exercise. The supporter could tell the seeker to go to the gym or to do some exercise.	labels:Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I've been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.
text:I agree fully and I'm happy for you. I think I've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything I loved. I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and I've shot up to 200. So I think if I can just get my routine down and exercise, I'll be alright. The seeker is worried about losing the love of her life. The supporter could suggest that the seeker go back to jogging and exercise and then start a new hobby. The supporter could also suggest, "Just get back in shape and get back in a healthier lifestyle."	labels:Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again.

The seeker made clear that she is scared of being rejected by her employer. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should focus on the resume and not worry about the other interview questions.	labels:It seems that you are mixed up in the decision to put in extra funds in a professional resume polish or use your time and energy instead of actual financial means. Is that right?
text:Exactly. I'm anxious that if I don't get professional help I won't land a job but then on the other hand I'm anxious that if I don't get a job I'll have needed the savings. The seeker was worried about losing her job at the end of the month. The supporter could try to help by giving the seeker some advice or resources to help with that.	labels:Perhaps you should speak to a trusted mentor or a closed loved one and seek their opinion.

She thinks about how she will be nervous about going to interview and how she can make it less stressful. It may help her to have time to think about the interview and have a strategy that is right for her. She may also try to get some advice from someone who knows what it's like to interview.	labels:Also, there are many online resources that are great at finding available jobs and require your time and effort, but not any money invested. This might be a good tool as well!
text:That's very true. Maybe I'll get started on that tonight. The seeker feels anxious because of fear. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a look at a friend or close family member who can help her. The supporter could also say that the seeker is not alone in feeling anxious.	labels:I hope so. I've also been in a similar situation so I can completely understand your feelings. Keep in mind there are also resume sites that are free to use, as I know you are concerned about the financial part in that area..
text:That's nice to hear! Sometimes it feels like I'm being dramatic. I really appreciate your thoughts, having an action plan really helps me feel less anxious. Thank you.

text:A second opinion is probably a good thing.  I just know I can't keep laying in bed 1/2 the day with the baby. (6) The seeker did not want to go to the doctor and felt a lot of anxiety. The supporter should ask the seeker if she has tried to get an appointment.	labels:Yeah that you cant, and i cant stress how good it is that you realize it. I would definitely go for a second opinion. Or even search for therapists that specialize in it in your area. Never have been a fan of using medicine as the first go unless really needed.

I'd like to be able to process through it(7) The seeker feels overwhelmed because she is worried about taking the medicine. The supporter should tell the seeker that she can take the medicine for a long time.	labels:And whats the worst a little talking can do for you. Has talking to other moms been helpful at all?
text:Well, some of them LOL!  Others just scare me to pieces so it really depends on who it is!  My husband does not understand at all but he's trying (8) The seeker is scared about talking about her relationship with the baby. The supporter should remind the seeker that talking to other moms is beneficial.	labels:At least he is trying, as i said before, even with it being so common, it is a mystery to most.
text:I don't think a lot of people talk about it.  You have this new healthy child, you should be excited, and yet there is extreme sadness and no idea why so you stay quiet about it (9) The seeker is excited and wants to be a mother.

text:Thank you for your empathy and understanding. You are so right, self care is so important as a mom, especially right now.

The supporter could also ask the seeker to do a study group on study skills.	labels:Have you spoken to anyone at the college about this?

The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a friend or family member, or a tutor.	labels:It's good to hear that you're not giving up. Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could. I like to tell myself in these situations that if there are no other avenues to explore, you just have to 'go with the flow' and don't beat yourself up thinking about it over and over - if there's nothing you can do, just do your best to ride it out.
text:I know, there is just so much riding on these finals.  I have great grades so I'm praying that I pass without any issues and that I don't bomb even one of them (5) Are you still there? The seeker was discouraged because she did not know if she passed, even though it is an important exam. The supporter should let her know that she passed and that she is still motivated.	labels:If you tried hard previously then you may come out the other end having done very well!  When I was at school a long time ago, I had to stay off school for a month, when they were practising the exams.

I used a guided meditation app. I also listened to white noise when I went to sleep as I was having trouble sleeping. I find even if you're mind is just taken away from it all for a few minute, it can re-balance you a little.
text:I've tried watching some comedy shows and listening to music to take my mind off of it.  It works sometimes (9) The seeker was anxious about going to finals. The supporter should suggest that the seeker asks for help.	labels:Maybe you should do more of that, it sounds like a good idea? Don't feel guilty for doing so either as it acts as a 'medicine'. If the 'medicine' works then take it.
text:I will try to focus more on that when I'm not studying and see if it keeps helping then (10) The seeker is doing meditation at night, and the supporter should tell the seeker to do meditate at night.	labels:Sounds like a plan! It's certainly worth giving it a go. We need a break from it all sometimes or we'd all go mad.	episode_done:True

The supporter could suggest that the seeker needs to talk to friends and do some research about time management.	labels:I understand. What are you struggling with concerning time management?. I have also struggled with time management. I have found that reminders on my phone, and a planner have been most beneficial to me personally. I understand every situation is different. Do you have a deadline you're trying to meet?
text:I am trying to manage having my kids's learn virtually at home, while I'm completing my Master's, and working at night. I feel like I have to drop my Master's because it all seems like too much.

The seeker is stressed about her job situation because of her lack of time management and her stress about her child being at home. The supporter could say to the seeker that she should be managing her time, or she should try to do more things.	labels:I can see how this would be very overwhelming. I have a child learning virtually as well. Similarly, I am a student. I am not working on my masters degree... I can't even imagine..
text:So you understand how the virtual learning has affected the day to day goals? I used to work during the day, complete my school work when the kids are in bed, but now everything seems so stressful. The seeker is stressed because the supporter has a kid and a job. The supporter could suggest to the seeker to find some help.	labels:Is your child old enough to do some of it on their own? I have "independent" or "together" next to each task. I purchased a large magnetic chalk board for our fridge. If your child is to young to do this I could see how this would be much more challenging for you.
text:That's a great idea! Two of my kids are old enough to work independently most of the time, they are 11 and 8. However, I also have a 3 year old that requires constant attention. Unfortunately, her daycare is closed. Even more, I had to take on my nephew because his mother could not handle the virtual learning. The seeker feels overwhelmed about the time management about her child. The supporter could suggest the seeker to start taking care of her child if she is unable to do it herself. The supporter could also suggest she set up a regular time schedule for her child to do her work.	labels:I completely understand how you feel. Virtual learning has affected our daily goals, though we are doing prerecorded lessons. That does make it easier I am sure. I have a 10 and 2 year old at home with me. One thing that has helped me is support groups. There are so many moms going through the same thing we are at this time.
text:I never even thought of support groups. It would help to connect with other moms, just to remind myself that I am not alone in this. Thank you so much. You also have a busy bee on your hands!. The seeker feels stressed about the Internet and struggling to manage time management. The supporter could tell her about the support groups she has used for anxiety in the past. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to spend more time with her kids.	labels:You are not alone in this. You could take the 3 year old to another room if possible and work on phonics/numbers, then help the older children during naptime. Then maybe they could help entertain the 3 year old while you work on your own schoolwork? This is similar to my daily schedule... but as you know with kids you have to go with the flow most of the time.
text:Definitely have to go with the flow. They make life wondefully unpredictable. Thank you and those are fantastic ideas. I'll have to create a naptime, that would be the most helpful. The seeker feels encouraged to connect with other moms. The supporter could tell the seeker that they could join an online support group. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to use Paypal to create an account.	labels:It helps so much to talk to other moms who understand. Being a mom is hard enough without all the added extra stress of 2020. It sounds like you're doing the best you can, and your kids will remember that in the long run. You can do this!	episode_done:True

The supporter could suggest the seeker to schedule a short break and maybe the seeker could attempt to work on the cause of the guilt.	labels:I often feel the same way when I'm not busy doing work. But sometimes you need that little break to get back into the zone and be more productive.
text:I try to take multiple 5 min breaks throughout my studying but it usually turns into hours breaks lol. its hard to focus. The seeker is stressed about exam.

The seeker is relieved to be done with studying, but she is still concerned about work. The supporter should ask the seeker to stay in touch with her and make sure she's feeling better.	labels:From what I've seen, you're not alone in that feeling.

text:Yes, I have that as my last resort. What do you think? Should I go ahead as I'm afraid my step may backfire me. The seeker feels like she is screwed up and wants to backfire. The supporter should reassure the seeker that his or her manager would never backfire on the seeker. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get a job in a different area that has a lot of work.	labels:I would not be able to let this go either.

The supporter can help the seeker to think that they can stop the feeling of shame.

I don't know that there's any particular fix for this, it's just sort of something to live with I think. The seeker feels like she is a single lady and is struggling to live like a single lady. The supporter could suggest that someone from her neighborhood help her make her living.	labels:I understand, you're in a very tough spot. Have your wife ever expressed her annoyance?

I mean otherwise we could all still hang out and whatnot. The seeker feels frustrated because it is too much. The supporter could offer to make it less stressful for the seeker. However, it is also true that the seeker could be able to have a long time relationship with her ex.	labels:That's not too bad then. Your wife seems to be mature and understanding.

The supporter could ask the seeker to compare their relationship to the relationship of the wife and ex.	labels:You and your wife can hang out a bit further from your home.

text:Yes it sucks.  I live alone now so there really hard sometimes. I tend to watch tv and lot and watch YouTube videos.  Nothing productive. The seeker is saddened by the lack of financial freedom. The supporter should tell the seeker that she has a lot of freedom and can help her here.	labels:I also live alone. So I can understand how you are feeling. You are not alone in this situation. Although you may feel that way. Have you tried connecting with friends via text, video call, etc? Sometimes that helps, even if it's not the same as face to face..
text:Yes, I have one close friend that I talk to every now and then.  Its not like it use to be. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a night on the town.	labels:Don't feel like you need to do a lot to be productive. Even getting up to watch tv is still getting up to do something. That's still a win..

The supporter should say something like have a few beers together.	labels:That's good. Keep that connection. It's not going to be the same due to the circumstances.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to get the vaccine before winter.	labels:What I found helped somewhat was joining a few social groups online. find something you like and find a group related to that.

The supporter could also ask the seeker to try to work on ways to get more motivation to do more work.	labels:I am hoping they get the vaccine going as well.

The seeker thinks that people will not be able to relate to the video at all. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should get a new camera, or something better.	labels:Yes, if you are doing longer videos, I recommend YouTube. What you can do, is do a short clip on TikToc and then in that clip instruct viewers to follow your YouTube Channel. Yes Snap Chat dissappears after it's viewed.
text:Wow.  Thanks for all the great information. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Sure, my pleasure!.	episode_done:True

The supporter could say to give her time to calm down.	labels:I make a list of the things I can do - And the things I can't. Then you can have goals. And if you can work on a goal, for example, if you need to write a resume, you start working on that a little bit every day until it's done. But if there is nothing you CAN do about the situation, you have to pray to God to help you then LET IT GO. If you can NOT fix it now, you will only make yourself sick thinking about it..
text:I know. I can't seem to shut my mind down. And not getting sleep doesn't help. The seeker tries prayer to get on a goal. The supporter should ask the seeker to start a prayer group.	labels:It is much more difficult for me to remain focused and positive when I lose sleep. I have had to focus on self care, finding a friend to talk about my problems with, not someone who will TELL me what to do, but support me. So you need a good support system. And I find things like prayer, Bible reading, nice soft sheets to sleep on and some herbal tea like Sleepy Time help me relax before bedtime. .
text:Those are some helpful points. I didn't think about herbal tea. The seeker has been stressed about losing job, but the reasons is not explained. The supporter should be able to get more details.	labels:And be kind to yourself, no one likes to lose a job, it's unsettling.

God has a plan in the future and it's very important to stay faithful to Him.	labels:You aren't in an easy place, but this can actually work out for your good.  I think if you focus on the GOOD that can happen, that might help your more. I would be concerned too, but if you even start looking for a job now, that might help you become more confident. I do encourage you to set goals.. I have found that the hard times are often stepping stones to better things, however at the time, all it feels like is hard times! lol. I'm an older lady - I'm almost 60. So I've had a lot of jobs, retired now, but I remember when my husband kept getting threatened with job layoffs. It was really disheartening for him.
text:oh wow. yeah, I'm so stressed it's not funny. The seeker is embarrassed that she is stressed and worried about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker to find professional therapy or spiritual care.	labels:If I had to do it over again, I would have encouraged him more to get that resume out and look for another job. The threat of losing his job was always hanging over his head. Yeah, it's not worth it my friend. Be pro active.
text:I've been trying to look on job boards and company websites but it's hard to find something that is close to the same level of pay.

The supporter could suggest to the seeker to sign up for a Study Group or study for a course before she starts working again. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to be active in a similar way.	labels:Sometimes a pay cut in the right company is a stepping stone IN the door, My husband lost a lucrative job one time, he started at a company washing dishes in his 40s, I kid you not, but he wound up moving up and retired early.. He wanted to provide for our family, so he was willing to humble himself, Looking back, I'm amazed. But he moved up. Once in that organization, he had lots of open doors, so you never know what God has in store for you..
text:Yeah but with my wife out of a job we can't afford for me to take a pay cut. We're already dipping into savings now. The seeker is worried about not having a job. The supporter could tell the seeker that God's will is going to be done. The supporter could say that God has a plan for the seeker. The supporter could also say that God is guiding her in her decision making process.	labels:I can understand that. Perhaps get together with her and look for ways to cut out spending. These are tough times. Even one car, or chicken instead of steak or canceling netflix or something like that. A few steps back is NOT failure, it can be prioritizing things in a difficult time..

The supporter could suggest the seeker to stop worrying about job loss in the future.	labels:I do want to assure you that even though I don't know you, you sound intelligent and caring and obviously wanting to provide for your family.

It'll be hard but I hope you can make it through it throughout the holidays and enjoy yourself some. Are there any pros to going back home? Any pets?

The smallest things, even a hamster, can be so beneficial..
text:Well thank you that does help me to feel better. Yes I am happy to bring him home with me and hoping I can have my niece over to introduce her to him. The seeker feels happy to bring the hamster home.

The supporter could give the seeker some advice on how to reach the goal.	labels:You have nothing to lose, really, you have weighed out that there is only good things that can come, but you think you must "feel" a certain way.

I had to learn a lot of skills to be this way and I like myself more too. Hahah. I'm old though, 59. You have nothing to lose, consider it a learning opportunity. Life is a journey.

I was with someone who was controlling in a lot of aspects so i can feel your pain and struggle. I can feel your anger too, and I imagine that it is alot.

The number one way I have had to help my depression is to pray and read scripture. I don't know if you are a Christian, but that has helped me a lot. The second way is to have a good friend who will listen, not someone who will TELL me what to do or judge me, but someone who can empathize with me. A good listener is worth her weight in gold.
text:I've learned that mines not really an emotional thing. I feel like my sleeping issue causes my depression. Because no matter what- i always feel exhausted. Nothing has helped it besides medication. It just sucks always feeling fatigued and energyless. I actually did take up religion here this year to help with the coping that comes with this. It was very helpful for a while there. The seeker relates to her depression because of her physical exhaustion. The supporter could suggest a friend to listen to the seeker and help her through it.	labels:If I didn't get good rest, then I would definitely feel tired the next day and over time, it would wear me out. I believe medication will help with the symptoms, but it is important to get the root of the problem, why exactly you find it difficult to sleep. Sometimes I take a benydryl because they always make me sleepy, but I usually know why I need to relax, I'm nervous about the next day. So I have found it important to know WHY I don't rest well, if that makes sense to you.
text:I plan on seeing a sleep doctor soon! Sometimes I lose sight of fixing the issue and need to be reminded. And yes!! I was treating my sleeping with Benadryl as well but it wasn't healthy to keep doing that.. The seeker has a sleeping problem, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask about the sleeping problem and why it is causing her sleep problems. The supporter could also ask her husband to pray for her.	labels:I'm also thinking there are a few practical ways you can help yourself sleep. I was advised to get soft sheets, make my sleeping area more restful, make sure the time before bed is relaxing and calming.. I also was helped a lot by a Christian Preacher, he's long dead, but he has audio on youtube -- Frank Hammond, Pigs in the Parlor. It's a 5 part series I found helpful, you might want to jot that down.  And I do encourage you to find a counselor, once you rule out the physical (doctor) then you can look at emotional, mental and/or spiritual. I think most of everything is spiritual and emotional to some degree, and our body just responds to that.
text:I always lose sight of how to make things better. It really helps to talk sometimes so someone can help me put things into perspective. I'll look into Frank Hammond! I am actually religious and would love to look into that. The seeker feels depressed, but the purpose of the conversation isn't mentioned. The supporter could suggest the seeker to study spiritual disciplines or therapy.	labels:I will definitely pray for you tonight because I know losing sleep is hard to deal with. But please have hope, sometimes we go through these things to possible get to deeper issues that might need to be dealt with. We only have a few minutes here, but I'm pretty old and I have found this to be true so many times.  Get a good support system of good friends. Having people who "get" you is SO vital to our lives. And learning to be grateful helps too. And especially journal, find out what may be bothering you. I had some abuse issues and that is why I had a hard time resting. I also would wake up in the middle of the night and obsess over problems with people. I had a lot to work through, but most nights, I sleep restful now. It may take time. I have hope for you! :D.
text:That sounds very similar to my situation! I always had some abuse issues. Thank you so much . Talking to you made me feel a lot better. The seeker feels like her abuse issues are discussed and it feels like she can help.

Sometimes it is really hard to push through difficult times!.

It took quite a few of them, but I did finally get unstuck.
text:I can try doing that. The seeker feels stuck. The supporter could tell the seeker to do something to get unstuck.	labels:Every one is different, but it is worth a shot, might help the rut your having, might also give you new ideas that will help you decide on how to not feel like your in a rut anymore. Sometimes just talking to someone can help too, bouncing ideas off of each other can help in some cases.
text:True,  I have been avoiding most people.. The seeker feels like she is avoided or is not getting any help, but the supporter could give the seeker more information to make the seeker feel heard.	labels:Its hard to talk about certain problems, so I can't blame you, however you can get some good ideas from others.

text:I will try reaching out to my sister tomorrow.  maybe she can help. I also feel embarrassed that I feel so unhappy.. The seeker feels embarrassed by her situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is embarrassed by her situation. The supporter could not help her because she is a very shy person.	labels:From chatting with you I can tell you might be ready to start talking and maybe get some help or advice, family is a great start they are typically a great support system. It is okay to feel embarrassed but being unhappy will eat at you, sometimes its good to set our pride aside so that we can figure things out. In my situation of feeling stuck I was ashamed that I sat and let people treat me so badly but it wasn't until I seen it as a problem that I started making my lists and getting advice. Some things we do on our own and some its good to have people to help. I think reaching out to your sister would be worth a try, she might also have different ideas and suggestions you haven't thought of yet.

She went on to say I need to get  tested because my best friend and fiance has been having an affair. I couldn't believe anything she was saying. I confronted my fiance know he would say it wasn't true. He didn't deny or confirm anything. He kept saying he was so sorry. I've been at moterl since Friday after i ran from the hospital. I don't know if my best friend is dead or where my fiance is. I'm scared and mad. I dont know if my best friend is dead or alive. I don't want to see my fiance because him being at the hospitalbefore me verifies what the sister said. How couldthey do this to me. There was nothing I wouldn't do for either of the two of them and this is how they repay me? I know its wrong but there 's a part of me that wants her and him to die.

I can't even imagine how hard this must be, but I would try to look at it in a positive way. I know that losing your best friend and your fiancé must be devastating, but at least you now know that your fiancé is someone who you most certainly probably don't want to spend the rest of your life with. I've been cheated on myself, believe it or not, and it was my daughter's father and my best friend. I can't believe how similar our stories are. I'm not even kidding! I refused to get back together with him (we were engaged at one time as well) and because I refused to get back together with him, he got my best friend pregnant and they are now together and recently had a second child. He has completely forgotten that our daughter exists.
text:Were you married to him? The seeker is mourning the loss of her best friend, but the reason for her mourning is not discussed. The supporter could say that it's normal when something bad happens to a best friend.	labels:I think I would start by putting your own health first and getting yourself tested to make sure that you haven't contracted anything from your fiancé. I know this will be incredibly hard, but I wouldn't want to see you getting sick and suffering as a result of his infidelity. No, we were not married. We were together for almost 7 years and engaged at one point, but I broke it off after he cheated on me. He cheated on me several times. It's the worst feeling in the world.
text:I'm scared to get tested. What if it comes back positive? Was the child he had a boy or girl? The seeker 's fears are that she was cheated on by her fiancé. The supporter could tell the seeker to take her time and restate her fears. The supporter could also give the seeker some advice.	labels:I would be scared, too. However, it's better to act now because to my knowledge, the sooner that you find out and treat it, the better the chances are of you treating it. There are a lot of new medications out there that can be used to treat HIV and AIDS.
text:Have you been tested for AIDS? What do they do when you get tested? The seeker is frightened about AIDS because of the sexual partner she has with her best friend. The supporter could help the seeker in finding other partners that can help her.	labels:I know that their first child is a girl. I'm not sure if their second is a girl or a boy. I haven't spoken to him in several years. I found out through a friend about their second child. We haven't spoken at all since I found out about the first one. I have been tested for all STDs because I was cheated on. All of mine came back negative. All they did when I got tested was bloodwork. Have you thought about reaching out to a therapist or counselor who could help you to work through your feelings and everything that you're dealing with?
text:Didn't you say you have a daughter by him? And you haven't talk to him since he cheated? What about your daughter feelings? She has a right to know her father doesn't she? The seeker feels hurt about being cheated on and that she has not spoken to her father and that she is afraid of what she might say. The supporter could also say that she has not spoken to her father in several years, but that she has not talked to him in weeks.	labels:I am so incredibly sorry that you have to deal with all of this at all but especially at the start of the holiday season. My heart absolutely breaks for you. Yes, we have a daughter. He spent the first eight years of her life in prison. I gave her the choice as to whether or not she wanted to get to know him. He had plenty of opportunities to speak to her and chose not to call or show up when he was supposed to. The last thing she said about him was, "All he does is lie to me and break promises. I don't want to see him or talk to him anymore."
text:And no I haven't thought or going to therapy. I'm not the one who cheated on anyone and this just happened Friday. I didn't  know where to start. So I called here. Are you or your daughter in therapy? The seeker feels hit by her insecurity about her relationship and her child. The supporter could tell her that she is not the one who cheated. The supporter could also say that he or she has been tested for AIDS and is not known for his/her ability to be friends with children and bring them up.	labels:I'm a great mother and I always put my daughter's feelings first. She made the decision not to see or speak to her father. Him and my now ex-best friend are on drugs and don't have custody of their own children. It's in my daughter's best interest that she doesn't know him. Yes, we are both in therapy. It helps immensely. I know that you weren't the one who cheated, but I would still highly recommend talking to someone about what happened. This is going to be very hard to get through. Again, I am incredibly sorry that you are going through all of this. Our chat session will only last for a total of about 30 minutes. This is meant to be a one-time task, unfortunately.
text:I'm not sure if you can help me because I've never did drugs. The seeker feels that he was the one who didn't do drugs. The supporter could tell the seeker that he has been married to someone who had drugs and that he was a part of her family.	labels:I never did drugs either. My daughter's father did. He still does, and so does my best friend. They lost custody of their kids. I have custody of my daughter. Anyway, I hope that you eventually become more open to talking to a therapist on an ongoing basis. I hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving.
text:Oh okay. I hope you and daughter have a nice holiday. My plan for the holdiay was to tell my fiance he's going to be a father and my best that she was going to be a Godmother. Now I don't know. It was nice talking to you. Good luck to you and your daughter. The seeker worries about her marriage because of her cheating on her best friend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk to her best friend and have a discussion about what the situation is.	labels:Oh, wow. I didn't know that you were pregnant. I hope that you and your baby are okay! I think you will be a great parent anyway! Best of luck to you.	episode_done:True

text:and my sister took advantage of my parents and I feel like she tried to use me to get my parents to give her money and when I put my foot down the whole family got into a fight and She flipped us off laughed and said we'd never get to see her daughter again. It's hard to explain. Her daughter and I hung out every day more than anyone else in the family hung out. I watched her. She always wanted to be with me and play games and talk with me. The day she left she drew me drawings saying 'I love you' and she told everyone she meant 'I love you' the most about me. and I cried and had a lot of anxiety symptoms afterwards because I'm literally not allowed to talk to her and I just feel she's in a negative place.

But just friday I was getting her stuff ready to pick up and I found like 700 dollars of clothes with tags on them and tons of expensive makeup and creams barely used. I just worry a lot about my niece she is so sweet, funny, and smart and she's living with someone who makes horrible decisions. sorry I'm talking a lot but just kinda unloading. The seeker has a lot of anxiety about her niece living with her parents. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her sister and friend. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professionals to help her.	labels:Well i can see you really care for your niece.

The seeker is confident and happy about moving forward with her sister and her niece. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a new place for her niece to live.	labels:Yea usually never anything good about loss. I am glad you are doing better now though.

Unfortunately you can only try to direct them to stop for so long before it can really damage your own well being, which should come first.
text:I agree, and after going through this in the past with her, I just can't sit and wait for the train crash.  she feels like she is doing nothing wrong because she has valid prescriptions.

The supporter could offer to get her a lawyer to look into her friend, or to talk to friends.

Then that is your decision. You should look out for yourself!
text:True, I definitely do not need to be caught up in her mess.  I have too much to lose.  I just feel bad like i am abandoning her.. The seeker feels guilty and abandoned by her friend, and the supporter should get her to find a new, more supportive friend.	labels:The thing is with drugs, that person already abandoned themselves.

The supporter could also tell the seeker that she will be okay and can continue to therapy.	labels:I do understand. It's really hard.

The supporter should ask for more details about her boyfriend.	labels:You aren't helpless! So much of this is mental and you being there for him is more helpful than you know.. Will you be able to visit him in the hospital?
text:I'm a little nervous about what kind of help he'll need when he gets home. Yes! I'm so relieved, with the covid restrictions. but I can. I think only one visitor at a time, but he moved her to be close to me (met long distance), so his closest friends aren't local. The ones he'd want to visit. The seeker is nervous about going to hospital for a cancer treatment. The supporter should tell the seeker to be there for her boyfriend, but not to go to hospital.	labels:Thank god! That will make such a big difference for both of you. Being alone would be scary.. Well he clearly loves you! I am happy that he's getting the treatment he needs and has someone so supportive like you helping him..
text:Thank you... it really helps to talk to someone. I worry about stressing out friends.

Especially when she was in treatment..
text:Right, and as I bet you can relate, breaks are hard to get in COVID days. that's what's scary, is right now, he's not in treatment. They think because of the cancer's location and the type, that surgery is the better option. So it's really just the cancer that is doing this to him. The seeker has a hard time getting energy to eat. The supporter should suggest that the seeker eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. The supporter could also suggest to get a good sleep schedule.	labels:Definitely hard. You'll have to try to find something for you to relax. Even if it's just walking or reading..

The supporter could suggest that the seeker find a puppy for the seeker to purchase for the seeker to pet.	labels:I'm sure!! Enjoy him. It's great for stress relief.

text:Yes, my friends has flown back. But I could not go because of all the restrictions. I am unable to pay last respects in person that was very close to me. The seeker feels sad because of the illness in her friend's father. The supporter could focus on helping her friends and family as a way to alleviate the stress.	labels:im so sorry to hear of this issue. do you have other outlets like getting out into nature? i find a good walk or a nice book helps with easing my mind.

text:Good to know about your recovery. Thanks for the information. Is COVID as bad as it sounds? The seeker is worried about her parents catching the covid. The supporter can suggest the seeker to catch covid and get you some support from a family member.	labels:it is bad but recoverable. alot of coughing and alot of sleeping. high fever. but a family member of mine who is 74 caught it. he has diabetes,obese and has heart trouble. he made a full recovery with no issues.

The seeker feels stressed for not having enough money for college. The supporter could counteract this by saying that the seeker has a lot to lose if she does not get it and the supporter could say that she would not be worried about her kids getting it.	labels:Do your kids understand how helpful wearing a mask can be?
text:They do.  They wear masks while at work but they still have boyfriends and they don't wear mask with friends or boyfriends. The seeker feels stressed because her boyfriends don't wear a mask because she does not wear a mask. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can wear any mask she wants.	labels:So sometimes you worry that they aren't doing enough to protect themselves.. I know I'm more worried about others than I am about myself right now.

I can imagine how scary that is for you.. My husband's work was at a standstill until summer. It is better but shows signs of slowing down too.

The supporter could ask the seeker to reflect on the struggles of company in general.

text:I know you're busy prepping for the holiday but I described my problem earlier. It should be listed either at the top or on the left side of your screen.

You are not interrupting anything.
text:Here! Last Christmas I bought the condo of my dreams. This April 2020 I lost my job due Covid 19. My unemployment is ending and my savings are depleted. I've recived an eviction notice and don't know what to do. Help! Have you ever been evicted? The seeker has been evicted from her job and can't get a job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to read up on evictions and better navigate the process.	labels:Where are you that you are able to be evicted?

text:I'm still in my condo but I no longer have a job, umemployment has run out and my savings are all gone. The seeker feels stuck, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could tell the seeker to take care of the situation, or ask for help from an attorney if needed.	labels:Well the plus side is they cannot kick you out right now. Have you talk to your landlord about working out some payment arrangement. Have you tried applying for any job?  Now is not the time for pride to get in the way, i would accept anything.
text:When you say work out a plan what do you mean? I have no job. I have been applying for jobs but I haven't received a callback or an offer of employment. Have you ever been in this situation? Also, I'm calling a helpline so Pride is not my issue. The seeker feels stressed, but the supporter should try to help her by giving her a plan. The supporter should also tell her that even though she is an unemployed person. Her problem is not her unemployment, but her lack of job.	labels:I have but the referendum on evictions with covid makes this situation different. I am sorry if that pride comment came off as crass. I was just trying to say desperate times come with desperate measures. They could work out a way you can pay extra monthly when you get back on your feet.
text:It's kind of hard to work out a plan when you don't know where your next meal is coming from don't you think? Do you know anything about the eviction process and where do people go once they have been evicted. Who is this they that your speaking about? I don't mean to be crass either but I have never been jobless or homeless either. So I'm desperate here and don't know what to do? The seeker says they are desperate and they are speaking out. The supporter can then ask the seeker to talk to someone that they know. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find a place to help them out.	labels:Your landlord. I worked out a way with payments when i was furloughed from my job. And yes i was actually homeless many years ago so i do know what it feels like to miss out on meals for a days at a time. It seems you should look up evictions during Covid. They are not allowed to throw you on the street as long as the pandemic is going on..
text:How did you eat and where did you sleep when you were homeless? How long did it take to end your situation? If you were homeless what did you say to your landlord that they still put you out? Where did you wash up or brush your teeth? The seeker feels homeless after reading about evictions and getting evicted from her job. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should find counseling.	labels:Oh for my situation it was 100% my fault i was in a bad place during that time. I spent my time couch surfing til my friends got tired of me. Bounced around shelters after i sold my car. Washing up and brushing my teeth were the least of my problems..

The supporter could also give the seeker a shiba inu picture and encourage her to use it to help her feel more positive.	labels:Have you considered getting into any hobbies to take your mind off of what's going on?
text:No no... my profile picture. Yours shows up as a squirrel. lol. I usually hike a lot, but my hiking groups aren't going out right now. The seeker reflects her loneliness because she does not have a group of people to tell her about her feelings. The supporter should ask for a group of people to connect with.	labels:Oh! I'm so sorry! Haha! Have you considered things like journaling, reading, or arts and crafts?
text:Maybe I should get a pet squirrel? Yes, I actually read and write quite a bit. Especially for work. That's not overly therapeutic, but it helps nonetheless. The seeker is looking to get into hobbies. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should be into arts and crafts, reading, and writing in order to improve her health.	labels:That may not be a bad idea! If you really like them and are able to properly care for it, animals can be very therapeutic!
text:I have one dog who isn't much bigger than a squirrel. She has been an invaluable companion. The seeker feels that she needs more attention from her friends, but she doesn't know how to ask for it. The supporter could suggest that she write down a list of friends that she wants to be close to. The supporter could also suggest that she ask her friends to talk to her.	labels:Writing and reading have been proven to be extremely therapeutic. I used to write down my feelings on a piece of paper and then destroy it (throw it away) once I was done. There's something about it that really seems to help. Aww! That sounds like an adorable dog! What breed of dog is she? I have two cats myself. They make me feel better on a daily basis!
text:I've tried to keep a journal but I never stick to it. I find that writing letters to friends serves me the same purpose, and it helps me to stay connected, too. Plus, people love getting real, hand-written mail. She is a miniature dachshund. Today she went to the bank with me, and all of the tellers came to the window to look into the car at her. lol  I like cats too. Animals are so healing. The seeker feels best when they stay connected with friends. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should go to a local coffee shop to write letters to friends.	labels:That sounds like a great idea! I love the fact that it helps you to stay connected, especially considering (as you already mentioned) that it's difficult to connect right now since we're dealing with COVID-19. I love that you're telling me about your dog and how all of the people at the bank wanted to see her! I bet that made you feel much better.
text:Yeah, and you're right. There's something therapeutic and cathartic about hand writing that typing does not replicate. Yes, it made me happy to see them fawning over her. And it made her happy because they gave her treats. Dealing with issues during Covid is so rough. The seeker feels good about the journaling. The supporter could remind the seeker that journaling is therapeutic for her.	labels:I couldn't agree more. Dealing with COVID on top of everything else has been extremely difficult for me. Honestly, I think it is part of what caused a lot of the issues that I'm currently dealing with.
text:I hope you're handling them okay. I'm generally well except for the whole breakup business. Still, I know I'm better off. It just sucks sometimes. The seeker is feeling worse about the breakup from the short time since the breakup. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to come back to the list of things she has accomplished. The supporter could also tell the seeker to get help.	labels:It makes me happy to hear that you know that you're better off. I know it's sad, but accepting that a relationship wasn't meant to be is, in my opinion, the first step to truly getting over someone. A year is a long time to spend with one person.
text:I wish it was easier and okay to travel right now. A trip or a road trip would do me wonders. So is five years! I hope everything works out for the best for you, too. The seeker feels lucky to be having a good relationship. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is well prepared for a good relationship. The supporter could also tell the seeker she is a good listener. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she can find herself in a good way with others.	labels:I completely agree!

The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing really well and is ready for future steps with her.	labels:Thank you so much! We broke up several months ago and I'm already feeling and doing so much better. I am also much better off without that person in my life. I've gained weight back that I couldn't really afford to lose to begin with, I've been more motivated, etc. It really was for the best even though the breakup itself was really difficult. I live in Pennsylvania as well! It's such a small world!
text:My breakup was a few months ago too. I'm in the Poconos. :) The seeker feels better than before she started the breakup. The supporter should ask the seeker to go to a friend's house to see her dog.	labels:I've always wanted to go to Las Vegas. My brother and his girlfriend just took a trip out there not too long ago.

The supporter could make fun of the seeker for having the Poconos.	labels:That's so cool! I've never been on a plane and I've never been anywhere north or west of Pennsylvania. I've been in every state from PA down to Florida, but nowhere else. I really need to travel more! That sounds like a beautiful area. Have you considered going skiing, snowboarding, or snow tubing since you live right near Blue Mountain?
text:Omg, yes. Travel! I've been to some really strange places. It's awesome. lol. The seeker was excited about going skiing or snowboarding.

I always see groupons for tubing, too. The seeker is excited about going tubing, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should remind the seeker that there is no really a reason for the seeker to have this conversation. The supporter could suggest that the seeker was too busy with her job or her family.	labels:You should look into it! It was a lot of fun when I went. I believe they're still open right now even though COVID is still going on. It took my mind off of everything while I was there.
text:Yes, they are open. I got an email yesterday or today that they're making snow now. The seeker is excited about going to snow tubing. The supporter should also talk about the many great things about skiing and snowboarding.	labels:Groupon is awesome! You're very welcome.

The seeker is excited about going to the hockey party, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker to find out more about the reason and what they should do to make the search of a good reason for going but not the reason itself.	labels:I'd love to go to a hockey game. I've never been to one. Thanks for your email!
text:I appreciate your help and ideas! I loooooove hockey. And live music. I go to hockey games in Allentown, too. The seeker has a hockey problem.

The seeker feels like she is not finding companionship, but she still wants support. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a friend or get help finding companionship.	labels:I understand where you are coming from.  I've seen a lot of men in relationships not be so committed for real, but just like the physical part.

The supporter could tell the seeker that this is a bad thing to do.	labels:From what I've seen having confidence in yourself and what you feel in your heart won't lie.

The supporter could tell the seeker that the person they are dating is not going to use the communication to their advantage.

What do you find is the hardest thing for you each day. That is, where do you find it hardest to move on?

The seeker feels mentally connected to the music and restaurants. The supporter could tell the seeker to create a list of the best places to eat and enjoy the music.	labels:Memories are a blessing and a curse.

The supporter could ask the seeker to do some activities to help her get over her relationship and accept that it is over.	labels:It’s hard when we have various emotions.

The supporter could suggest that the seeker should join a study group or stay home from work.	labels:indeed. you mentioned that the salary you are getting doesn't cover everything. is it not covering houseing expenses?

The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not being realistic. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker find a job and start paying herself a salary to help her out.	labels:you are absolutely right! i don't understand the resistance to mask wearing. it's baffling. i'm so glad you are staying safe.
text:Quite! Do people really want to be infected? Does it hurt them so much to wear a mask and socially distance?

The supporter should ask the seeker to look up information to find out the outcome after finals.	labels:I am sure that whatever happens, you will do well with them.

The supporter could tell the seeker to take part in a study group or to try to find friends.	labels:im sorry to hear that, care to talk about it?
text:sure. The seeker did talk about being alone and in a lot of pain. The supporter should also tell the seeker to be an active participant in the conversation and not just passive.

text:Because everyone I come across is into drugs and I do not do drugs. The seeker feels alone, sad, and not sure how to make friends. The supporter should try to help the seeker by giving her a plan on how to make friends.	labels:are you in support or recovery yourself?
text:recovery myself. I can not do it but I also have relapsed because of someone I met so I am just alone now because I am not going to do drugs again. The seeker feels alone and is in recovery. The supporter could explain how to make friends.	labels:i know that can be a very tough situation, my father and brother are both addicts. it helps to have a good support structure around you to stay in your sobriety. do you go to any group meetings or support groups?
text:yes it does and I have no support because i moved to a new state so all my family is in tn and i am in ga now, no i do not i might think about that though i was thinking of maybe doing something online, but my finance is and i are doing a long distance thing for now and I do not want to accidentally go over a line if i happen to be paired with a male to talk to so i am just here waiting for him to get home. The seeker feels alone because her father and brother are in the same state. The supporter could ask the seeker if the seeker moved to a new state so they don't have to talk to them.	labels:well, when it comes to support groups, you can choose your sponsors and people who you want to build your support group with, i know it can be hard living in a state away from your family, i live in California and my family lives in Texas. You could also look at married men as an acceptable solution to avoiding that line as well. are you religious at all?
text:no i dont think that would go over well. No i am agnostic. I do wish i had a good friend that knew me who I could talk to. he told me i could talk to one friend in tn and i call when i need something but it bothers him so i try not to do that. The seeker feels lonely because no one knows her. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a good friend to talk to.	labels:there are always groups on social media, some are even local. so your fiance is upset when you talk to your friend back home?
text:yeah it bothers him. and i don't want to bother him.. The seeker talks about her fiance. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk to her fiance and tell that she is not feeling well. The supporter could also suggest that, if she does not feel well, she should go to a doctor, be sure to tell her that she needs to go to the doctor. If she is feeling better, she could tell her fiance that he should tell her to go to the doctor.	labels:is your fiancé in reovery himself?
text:yes he is. The seeker feels frustrated because she is not in a group with her fiancé. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should attend a meeting or talk to her fiance.	labels:do you talk to him about how you are feeling about your recovery as well? or is this conversations that you only have with your friend?
text:i talk to him about everything. he has been a good listener. The seeker feels like she is an atheist and can't talk to her fiance.

The supporter should suggest the seeker to contact her support group for support.	labels:I understand how you feel, especially when you're looked down by the one you care the most.
text:I wish I had a different home, but I can't change that now.  I'm trying to work so hard to do better, but it will take time. The seeker feels depressed when she realizes that she didn't get a home. The supporter should be nice and try to help her out of her stress.	labels:It is not your fault. It's actually your ex's problem. There is nothing to feel ashamed of.
text:Thanks for the encouragement. The seeker feels relieved because she knows that the supporter can help her. The supporter could also let the seeker know the reason.	labels:You can actually use this as a motivation to show your ex how much he missed.
text:I think he is missing out on a lot, but he isn't going to realize this now. The seeker felt guilty because she missed out on a lot because she is the one person in her life who she can't change. The supporter could give her encouragement to not feel guilty.	labels:yes that's the right attitude. As long as you are determined, I believe you can do anything you want.
text:Do you think someone else will love me for who I am? The seeker feels insecure about her boyfriend and feels worried because he did not love her before. The supporter could help the seeker reassure herself by telling her that someone else will love her for who she is.	labels:Of course, you will find the right one soon.
text:How can I move forward?  Should I try to get him back and get him to realize he is not looking at my heart? The seeker is with her boyfriend, but she wants to move forward. The supporter could say to the seeker that if it is possible, he is someone that she can love.	labels:Use the time you have now to invest in yourself. When you're the best version of yourself, the right person will come to you natually.
text:Can I invest my time in anyone from outside my neighborhood? The seeker feels isolated from her neighborhood. The supporter should help the seeker to find a good job. The supporter should also ask the seeker to find the right apartment.	labels:No, there is no reason trying to win that guy back, Even if he comes back after you get successful, he's after your status, not you yourself. Of course, however, the best person will come in your life when you're not looking.
text:That sounds like good advice. The seeker is trying to overcome an obstacle. The supporter could also help the seeker to be aware about the obstacles and make sure that they are not bad.	labels:As I said, good things will eventually come to you.
text:Thanks so much.  That is reassuring.  I'm starting to feel better. The seeker feels better after the supportive encouragement.

text:How can I help you?\nI chose a past experience so this will be hypothetical. But I'm looking for ideas for other resources for this course since my professor isn't helpful. The seeker feels a gift. The supporter could be more specific to the seeker.	labels:I see you are looking for some resources on a course that your professor isn't helping you with.  What kind of questions do you have?
text:What other ways can I get help to perform better? Who should I talk to? The seeker is worried about not getting help from the professor. The supporter should suggest the seeker to talk to friends and family.	labels:Are you looking for help to perform better in a certain subject in college?
text:Yeah I am, it's differential equations. Are you able to see the situation description I wrote that has more details? The seeker is looking for help, but the supporter could say that the seeker could get help from a certain student in the other course.	labels:I didn't see all the specifics but I remember taking that class.  I went to my counselor and got a tutor which helped so much.  It was offered for free at the college.  Do you think you that is something you'd like to check out?
text:Yeah that could be useful. I'm not sure if my school offers that - the math department isn't very good. I'm an engineering major. I wonder if an engineering professor or student could help instead. The seeker feels stressed because of the math class. The supporter could suggest the seeker to check out a professor or student.	labels:I had a student who was a genius (by my standards) helping me and he was so patient and understanding.  This lessened the pressure and helped me move forward successfully in the class.
text:Yeah that would be helpful. I think I need to hear things a different way. The professor is very confusing, but when I have gotten help from other students the concepts don't seem hard. I just don't do well with his teaching style I guess, it's not that I'm not smart enough to understand. Does that make sense? The seeker feels pressure, but it is not clear if she is being helped or not. The supporter could suggest the seeker to seek a mentor or someone who can help her in some other way.	labels:Yes, I understand that sometimes being able to interpret things from someone who can communicate well can make the difference in understanding things. .
text:Yeah, it can be very stressful when I don't understand though. I'm normally a very good student so it's easy to be hard on myself. But it's good to hear that this is a pretty common experience. The seeker feels stressed about the difficulty of knowing how to research the subject. The supporter could show the seeker how to break tasks and classes into smaller groups and make it more manageable. The supporter could also show the seeker how to study the content and exams in groups.	labels:Yes, I had a 100% average almost in high school and still struggled with the class.  I kind of wish they videotaped the classes that I could rewind and go back to at the time of college.  When I got to grad school, I ended up being able to audio record sessions and understood things so much better because I could reference the books while listening to a lecture.  That made so much difference. .
text:Yeah that sounds really nice. One of the hardest things was that the professor would never go back and explain what he did, so a problem might be 20 minutes long and if you got confused 3-4 minutes in you were just lost for the rest of it. The seeker feels frustrated about the professor. The supporter should tell the seeker that he or she could have any questions. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to read books that are also difficult, something as simple as an English class.	labels:Lots of research also has shown that getting enough sleep is important for performance as well.
text:That is actually one thing I'm pretty good at. I'm miserable when I'm tired, so I almost always get 7-8 hours a night. The seeker has been having a hard time sleeping and the supporter should help her. The supporter could offer to talk to friends or a therapist to help the seeker.	labels:It sounds like you are making efforts to do your best to sleep and understand the materials.  You can give yourself a pat on the back for all the great efforts!
text:Thanks! It's reassuring to know other people felt the same way with this course. Sometimes I felt like I was dumb or lazy because I didn't understand, but it sounds like it's just challenging and those feelings are normal. The seeker feels the pressure of studying other people's work. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should do the same. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she should be focusing on her work.	labels:Sometimes you have to give yourself more credit because you are doing a good job.
text:Yeah, that has always been hard for me, but I'll try to be deliberate about that. The seeker wants to be more aware of how to be a better student. The supporter should answer some questions about the student. The seeker should ask for assistance to improve her study habits.	labels:Do you feel better about the situation?
text:I do, thanks! The seeker feels better about the situation because it is not mentioned. The supporter could also tell the seeker that there are other resources and people to help her.	labels:Great, I hope you keep encouraged and working hard toward your goals because you deserve the very best with your hard work.
text:I am, thank you. I feel good, and I think we have completed the requirements of the study, so I am good with wrapping up our chat now if you are. The seeker feels good about her situation and the supporter should tell the seeker to try and feel better about it. The supporter should also tell the seeker to get support from a friend or family member.	labels:Great!  Have a good day.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, are you free to talk?. The seeker is free to talk. The supporter should encourage her to speak up and to explain her perspective.	labels:Hello, how can i help you today?
text:I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse.. The seeker feels terrible about the death of her father. It would be nice to have someone to talk to. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get counseling or get a private lawyer to help.	labels:Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating. Was it an accident, illness or natural old age?
text:He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.. The seeker feels terrible because of the death of her father. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and family.	labels:That is rough, both for you and him. I know it's meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he's not in a better place.
text:I presume you mean now and not not ;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was. The seeker does not mention that she does not believe that her dad's death would make her sad. The supporter could also tell the seeker to try to work on her grief.	labels:oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn't it? I sometimes think it's meaningless too.
text:I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away.. The seeker feels sad about dying dad. The supporter could tell the seeker that her dad is not in a better place because his death was unexpected. The supporter could also tell the seeker that she does not have to feel sad about her dad. The supporter could tell the seeker that her dad is a good person.	labels:I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy. In fact, it's confusing when you grieve and even when you recover and move on.
text:Do you think that people ever really recover from a significant bereavement?. I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened .. there is guilt that comes with that.. The seeker feels guilty and guilty about missing his dad. The supporter could suggest that the seeker may be in a better place if she had a better excuse for not going to church on his birthday.	labels:I don't think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around.
text:Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.. The seeker is grieving because he is missing his father. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not a loss to him. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the loss is not important.	labels:I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it's completely normal and you shouldn't feel guilty for having it.
text:It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him.. The seeker feels guilty, but the seeker is not told that. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is ok to not think about the past.	labels:Your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he'd love to see. I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued.
text:I know that he did :). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement!. The seeker is saddened by her dad's death. The supporter should ask the seeker if she ever thinks about the loss.	labels:That's sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time.
text:Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun.. The seeker feels that he is not ready to tell her father, who she loves dearly. The supporter should ask the seeker to find a therapist. The supporter could tell the seeker that if the seeker is not ready to tell her father, she can find someone else to tell him.	labels:have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving.
text:I can't really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money.. The seeker feels guilty about not having therapy. The supporter could ask the seeker to set up a meeting with a professional or support person.	labels:he seemed to be a great man. Instead of regretting what happened, celebrate how great of a person he was.
text:That is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. You have been a really great help to me.. The seeker is very thankful to have a soul mate and feels that his dad was a great person. The supporter could tell the seeker that her father is going to be happy. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker seek help from a professional.	labels:I'm glad I could be some help for you.	episode_done:True
text:How can I be of support?\nI've lost my job due to COVID and I'm really worried. The seeker is worried about losing her job. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to a friend or family member who understands her situation.	labels:That is so difficult because you lost your job. What are your goals at this point?
text:I want to look for a new job, but I'm worried about being out with COVID. The seeker feels unprepared for leaving her job. The supporter could ask the seeker to update her resume and ask for the job her friend is in for the support.	labels:I see that you are worried because working in an environment while dealing with COVID is scary.
text:I don't know where to begin. The seeker feels worried about working with COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker to get a job there. The supporter could suggest she should get a job there.	labels:Are you interested or open to looking for a different career path?
text:Not particularly but I am open to it. The seeker is concerned with where she is at in life, but she is not open to new career path. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her family and friends, but the supporter could also ask her to find work and volunteer.	labels:I can see that it is stressful looking into another career path, but you have work experience which will help you on that path if you choose that.
text:Where do I begin to look for new jobs? The seeker feels stressed and worried about looking for other career path. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find work experience.	labels:Often times career centers can help you to find job opportunities or perhaps online college could be an option if you want to further your education.
text:Those sound like great ideas some of which I hadn't thought about before. The seeker is excited about finding new job opportunities. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look for jobs on the Internet or through local job sites.	labels:I had a college degree but found out my career wasn't working out financially.  Online college became a lifesaver because I could have the flexibility of being at home.  You don't have to be  exposed to COVID when doing online work or college options.
text:Yes, that's true.  Maybe that will help me pass the time too when it is so hard to be at home.  I would be working toward a long term goal. The seeker is worried about working at home.

text:Hello there! How may I support you today?\nI have an issue in that coronavirus and all the news is giving me a lot of anxiety. I really don't want to leave the house and start to panic at the thought. The seeker is stressed about the coronavirus news. The supporter should give the seeker encouragement.	labels:I totally understand. The pandemic is once in a lifetime event and it has turned all our lives upside down. I hope you are aware about the potential vaccines with great success rate announced my major pharma companies.
text:Yes. I watch the news and it's everywhere these days. There seems no end to it. The seeker feels anxious about the news. The supporter could take this seeker to a meeting or group where she can learn more about the situation and the pandemic.	labels:Yes, there seems to be some credibility to the claim - the effectiveness of the vaccine. So I would say even though it seems a lot difficult, there is some hope early next year.
text:What of his vaccine doesn't work. Even the thought of leaving the house still feels me with worry and I start to feel panicked. It's like my mental Outlook has completely changed. The seeker feels anxious about leaving the house. The supporter could tell the seeker she should give an answer about the vaccine.	labels:I understand your concern. In fact, a lot of people have questioned the effectiveness given how fast it was developed. Are you anxious because you have to provide for your family besides yourself?
text:In fact I have been on sick leave from work since it started. My partner is understanding to a point but yes, I'll need to provide once this is all over. I'm starting to think I'll be scared of leaving the house, even when Covid gets managed and we gather back to 'normal' The seeker feels anxious, but she doesn't want to leave the house. The supporter can suggest the seeker to talk to a friend or a family member about it.	labels:I too, have been working from home for the past 9 months. And I am the sole provider for my family. So I understand how frustrating this can be.
text:it's great that you can relate. how are you managing those frustrations? The seeker says that she is the sole provider for her family. The supporter can tell the seeker that the dysfunctions in her life like work and childrearing are just in the past. The supporter could also say that the seeker's job is just as stressful.	labels:The key, however, is our mindset and how we approach the problem. If you are afraid about going our during peak hours, you can step outside during non-peak hours. This is just an example. Everybody's situations and preferences vary. I am frustrated, but I cannot cultivate inaction. Because I have mouths to feed. So I have developed a mindset to tackle the problem by taking all the precautions I possible can.
text:so you mean maybe leave the house when it's really quiet to begin with? then slowly build on that over time. isn't this called exposure therapy. I think I have read about this. The seeker is afraid of going to the house during peak hours. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should have thought about this before.	labels:In essence, I know the factors under my control, and I try to control them and work them in my favour. I make it a point not to worry too much about factors outside my control.
text:I suppose it makes no sense to worry about things you can't control. I think from my perspective that's exactly the problem, not having control. I don't know why this has affected me so much? The seeker feels anxious and worried about leaving the house. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to college and take care of the future of the family.	labels:Because it's a new situation to most of the world's population! People take time to adjust. You take care of factors under your control - wearing a mask , social distancing when outside and washing/sanitizing hands whenever you can. Try not to pay too much attention to factors OUTSIDE your control - how many people are there and if social distancing is followed to the letter by OTHERS.
text:yes I know about all the guidance and it would help to follow this. I see my friends dealing with it just fine. I wonder what is making it so hard for me? perhaps I'm overthinking it and just worrying about it excessively. The seeker is worried about the lack of control. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should get help to control her self. The ally could also suggest that she should also have a therapist to help her with her self-confidence. The supporter could also tell the seeker to think about her life.	labels:Ya, that might be the root cause. Talk with your partner and try going out when you and them feel it is safe to do so. Start cautiously, then slowly return to your "normal" outdoor times. It can be intimidating at first, but if you don't try, you may never be able to overcome the anxiety or fear.
text:yeah I think I really need to give that go. if that doesn't work maybe there are some support groups out there? The seeker is anxious about going outside to go shopping. The supporter should also ask if there are any groups?	labels:I am sure there are, but make sure those groups are social distancing as well. We are all in this together and we can definitely overcome it :)
text:So true! also I think I need to stop watching the news and obsessing about this. The seeker thinks about death and time spent outside. The supporter could tell the seeker to take time to relax and start to feel better.	labels:Yes. You can distract yourself with music or comedy shows. Or a long lost hobby. After all, one good thing about COVID is, it has put more time on our plates.
text:the one thing I do have is time. Thanks for talking through this with me. The seeker feels that she is worrying and stressed, but the reason is not mentioned.

text:Ok Kinda, my back is just hurting so bad today. The seeker feels that she is being treated unfairly by the supporter. The supporter could mention some side effects of the harassment she had. The supporter could also suggest that she take a time out from the situation.	labels:So you have an issue with your back, are you experiencing constant pain?
text:yes, it is like a real Charlie Horse that just won't stop. The seeker feels like the supporter is concerned about her back and not aware of the reason. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a back exam or a physical.	labels:Have you been doing an activity that has triggered this? Or have you woken up and felt a difference?
text:It has been going on for over ten years now. I can't hardly walk and I can't hardly sit still. The seeker feels a constant pain.

The supporter should ask the seeker to go to a physical therapist or have a physical therapist check in with the supporter.	labels:from what I can tell you have tried many Solutions. I can see that you are committed to finding something that can work for you. personally I think it is only a matter of time until you find the right combination for you if you can stay positive.
text:I try to hide the pain from my family because the man of the house is suppose to be strong and provide for his family. I have a very loving wife and a set of twin boys that just turned 13. I am blessed in so many ways but I still seem to have to suffer to enjoy it. The seeker tells the supporter that she struggles with back pain. The supporter should offer the seeker something to help her. The supporter could suggest to ask her to join a study group to get more motivation.	labels:if I'm being honest I can relate to this. I have a young son and a small family myself. I have had problems with my hearing and tinnitus that is manageable at the moment but constant. in feels like nobody understands just how difficult this can be.
text:I feel your pain, I have came a long way in managing the pain mentally. I try to block it out and keep my mind busy to not think about it. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. The seeker feels sad about her voice quality. The supporter will help her.	labels:ok so I assume you spoken to many medical professionals about this. have you had a diagnosis?

The seeker feels better about her health and confidence in her family. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing a great job.	labels:if I am being completely honest I think you are incredibly strong. Have you seen a pain management specialist that can help you block out pain? also there may be new advances in pain relief so it would be a good idea to keep up with advances in managing pain. You may be able to take part in studies for new developments.
text:Sounds great, I will check into it with my doctor. Have a nice day.. The seeker is feeling a great deal of pain from her spine. The supporter could suggest a study or treatment to help with her pain.	labels:take care it was nice talking to you.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, I am desperate to get some help for my ongoing depression, is there anything that you can do? The seeker does not mention her depression. The supporter could suggest that the seeker should talk to someone. The supporter could also tell the seeker to read some literature about depression.	labels:Hello, I am certainly gonna try to help! What triggered the depression tonight?\
text:Well, it's not really any worse tonight than it has been for years. I just don't know how to get out of it and I suspect that I might never be able to.. The seeker does not know that she is depressed and will not get help. The supporter should ask for some psychotherapy before anything can be done.	labels:Not that I'm typically a fan of this, but there are certain justifications and it has its place.

text:I have been prescribed some medication by my GP but I cannot really afford professional counselling.. The seeker has been prescribed medication, but the supporter could ask for more details.	labels:There are a lot of programs in place to assist those who're in need of psychiatric evaluation and treatment but dont have the financial means to pursue it.

text:The trouble is also that I have tried a variety of medications and none has really been all that helpful. Yes, I am on some waiting lists but I do not know how long it might take to get to the top of them. The seeker feels that she has too many bills to pay. The supporter could suggest that the seeker stick to paying all her bills so she can not be in this situation for too long. This could be a great way to help the seeker.	labels:Medication isn't always the best solution. I speak from personal experience. Also,  its better to be inching up a list than reluctant to be on it at all.
text:Why do you say that medication is not the best idea? I am aware that it is not a panacea but it can help to take the edge off, as it were.. The seeker feels that medication is not the solution, but she does not know what to do. The supporter could try to get her name on the lists. The supporter could also ask the seeker to attend a free free mental health examination.	labels:It absolutely can take that edge off, but often so can many other things, like painting, writing, talking to a friend or a stranger even. I don't mean to suggest you stop any medication without medical advising. I simply mean to say that there are advantageous methods of therapy that dont involve a pill.
text:I think that there are some conditions where medication is necessary but I do take your point that there are other things that we can do to alleviate symptom. Maybe it is best to do these things in tandem?. The seeker feels stressed, which is not mentioned. The supporter could suggest that the seeker can begin therapy to alleviate the stress.	labels:You're absolutely right that sometimes there is a need for medication. My mother suffers from depression as do I. She has to take Effexor everyday for her condition. I,  however went through COUNTLESS combinations and never found a relief as helpful as when I write and talk to people.

The seeker feels depressed because of Prozac. The supporter can help the seeker by mentioning that they have struggled with depression.	labels:Have you explored other theraputic avenues to synchronize with the medication?

The supporter could also say that it is better to take medications.	labels:You're doing VERY well talking to me! Had you not said anything, I would have assumed that to be the best  choice! But if you're an introvert, then my first suggestion is to journal..
text:I do do a lot of that but I would feel too shy to show anyone my journal. Your help has been invaluable though and I do feel more receptive to other forms of treatment now.. The seeker feels more receptive to other therapies. The supporter could suggest more information about the types of therapies that are available.	labels:That way you can reflect on what you've written and possibly learn patterns, triggers, moodswings and other information that would help the problem. Journaling is for YOU. No one else has to ever see it if you don't want them too. Glad I can help.

I hope to see you again soon.. The seeker feels more relaxed and is more relaxed about her depression. The supporter should encourage the seeker to write down what she has been feeling but not to tell anyone.	labels:Anytime.	episode_done:True

Are you able to talk to them about your concerns?
text:Yes but they get angry with me. I don't know how to get through to them, The seeker feels frustrated about the problems with her friends. The supporter could try to help her.	labels:Some people express their frustrations in certain ways. Do you think there is another way to communicate with them? It's also okay to stand up for yourself and stand by what you feel is right..
text:I really don't know I just haven't been seeing them at all but I see through social media that they have large parties but I do feel left out. It's a weird dynamic. The seeker feels left out because of the party. The supporter could suggest that the seeker find a new job.	labels:It sounds like you're finding it hard to balance the isolation you feel during this pandemic, while you know it's the safest option, with the social gatherings your friends are having.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to find other people to help her on her journey.	labels:that is such a hard position to be in. it sounds like you are doing your best by choosing to be safe and keep your distance..
text:I'd like to think so but I wish they would too. It's hard to know what is right. The seeker feels isolated, but the supporter can help the seeker to come out of the isolation and join in the community.	labels:I have found that having vitural movie nights, or going on socially distanced walks with my pals has been so helpful with staying connected. Is this something you think your friends would be willing to try?
text:Yes, but they'll have their BBQs and parties anyway. They are having a group Thanksgiving and there will be a lot of people there. My husband and I feel bad that we aren't going, but we also know it isn't smart. The seeker is feeling isolated, but the supporter should make an offer of support.	labels:I think a lot of people are going by the notion that you can't live your life in fear, and that they're going to have these big family gathering regardless of what is happening with COVID. The stats have shown that after holidays the cases have surged, for example, memorial day, 4th of July, labor day. But I think its important to remember the bigger picture that peoples lives are literally at stake and the people that disregard need to be more aware..
text:We feel like after this is all over, they will still remind us that we were standoffish during this time. And I agree. The longer we put it off and don't take it seriously, the longer it will last. The seeker feels frightened because she fears that the family gathering will not be safe. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go to church on Sunday and go over with her friends and talk about the case.	labels:Can you tell them that that just isn't the case? You and your husband are making the right choice by staying home for the safety of yourselves and others. If I am correct, it has nothing to do with the fact that you don't want to see your pals and family! From chatting with you it sounds like your relationships with these people is incredibly important to you.
text:Yes that's totally accurate. Yes they are. They are good people. They just think living for the moment is the bigger picture. The seeker feels that the people that care about them are not interested in them, and that they shouldn't be concerned about them. The supporter could suggest that they are worried about their relationships, and they should stop judging them.	labels:I hope your friends can see how important they are to you and thats a huge reason why you're not seeing them..
text:I think they do. They just think that this is a hoax. The seeker feels left out and feels like she is being overshadowed. The supporter could make the seeker to tell the supporter that she is not going to be as busy as she would like, as it is because of the hobbies she is involved in, her husband is solid and her family is strong. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker takes time off and spend time away from work.	labels:I know a lot of people that think the same thing. I have one friend who thought that, and they ended up contracting COVID. Thankfully she was ok, but after she got it she definitely didn't think it was a hoax anymore. I hope they understand the risk they are taking..
text:That's scary. Yeah I don't think they get it. The seeker is scared about the prospect of hurting people. The supporter could tell the seeker that it's better to not hurt people. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker should avoid parties, because of the possibility of getting into trouble.	labels:I am proud of the choices you are making and I hope you can take some comfort in knowing that you are doing your part in helping keep things under control. There is a strength in numbers and the more people who understand that the faster it can be controlled..
text:Thank you. I hope it gets better. But anyway thank you for giving me the chance to open up. The seeker feels like they are a part of a group of people who are important to them and they can't talk to them.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to join a study group so that the seeker can talk to other students who are like her.	labels:I understand that you are feeling like your professors don't see you as a person with feelings. What happened to make you feel this way?
text:I have testing all the time and study non-stop, but the professors don't seem to encourage or support me.  They just see me as a number I feel. The seeker feels irritated by the lack of support and encouragement her professors give her. The supporter could tell the seeker to ask questions or come up with ideas to help her.	labels:That's hard to feel like they are treating you like a number when you are working so hard.  Have you talked to them about it?
text:It's hard to trust them when I'm seen as 1 of 100 people.  If I am struggling they don't flinch or ask me how they can assist.  I just am expected to. tough it out. The seeker feels overwhelmed by the professors. The supporter can encourage the seeker to ask for help from faculty and their education department. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker take a class with a teacher and explore the world outside of academia.	labels:I had a similar experience in my college days. It was very difficult to have so much pressure to succeed and feel so alone.  You can do though because you are working hard and want to succeed.
text:Thanks for the encouragement.  Where do I start to help myself feel better? The seeker feels like the support is not giving enough support because of the stress and anxiety. The supporter could change the conversation about the stress, the stress and the anxiety.	labels:I see you are anxious about this when talking to you, but have you thought about getting some support from other students in your position?

It's so different from high school and home when my parents encouraged me and supported me full-heartedly. . The seeker feels anxious that they will not get support when they work their hardest. The supporter could offer encouragement and encouragement from others.	labels:College can be quite a change from the protective atmosphere of home.  Have you tried any support groups or religious groups for encouragement?
text:I am religious so perhaps I could seek a group out and they could help with encouraging me. . The seeker feels relieved, but the supporter should not tell her to seek help from other students.	labels:I was a  part of a religious group in college and they were very supportive even praying for me on exam days.  I felt they helped me with my success by planting seeds of positive feedback to me.
text:I used to be part of one during high school years, and that sounds like it would help. The seeker has been given encouragement by the supporter. The supporter can share some support group information to the seeker.	labels:Are you starting to feel better about the situation?

text:I actually have a job, but I made a mistake and I think I could get in trouble and I'm not sure how to approach my manager about the mistake I made. It is, we have been working from home since March. I actually started my job working from home, something that wasn't expected when I was first hired. The seeker is worried about getting in trouble. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk to her manager or her boss. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find other sources of work.	labels:Ok, apologies for my earlier assumption! May I please know more details about the nature of your problem?
text:Thats ok! We had been given a deadline for end of day this upcoming monday to have a number of projects completed. Some projects take only part of day to complete while others take multiple. I made the mistake of prioritizing the ones that take less time to be sure I was able to get as many done as possible. I in turn, forgot to start the other projects that take a couple of days until friday (yesterday) so now these couple of projects wont be done by the deadline. The seeker is concerned about the deadline and her time is limited. The supporter should ask the seeker to set schedules and get in the habit of getting in the habit of getting projects done on time.	labels:Ok, if I understand correctly, you prioritized some work to be done later, which unfortunately had an earlier deadline, is that correct?
text:Yes essentially. They all had to be done the same day, but I prioritized the work that took less time in order to get more of them completed. So now these ones that take longer (with the same deadline) wont be finished in time. I'm worried about talking to my manager about this.

text:Oh thank you thats kind of you to say. That is good advice. The seeker feels better because she knows she is able to get things done. The supporter could tell her that she is a good person to talk to about her mistakes. The supporter could also tell the seeker that the mistake she made will not be enough to make up for that mistake.	labels:You tell him that this has been a valuable lesson and you have learned a lot from it. And that this mistake would not happen again. If your manager is a leader and not a boss, he would appreciate your honesty and give you chance to rectify.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a group of friends to help her and get more motivation.	labels:Your motivation and how you are studying is probably related, you are right.

However, i hear that you have always found it fascinating,have you considered talking to your uncle and seeing if you can find what you loved about it again?

The seeker is stressed but does not have the motivation to change. The supporter should encourage the seeker to find a mentor, or common interest.	labels:Studying can be really difficult , especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support.

The seeker feels afraid to approach the support because of the exams. The supporter could suggest that she should do the same.	labels:Just from chatting to you, I can sense that you are anxious, however, as many students feel this way, they will have a whole lot of help they can provide.

The supporter could also ask the seeker what she is doing to overcome the fear.	labels:One suggestion is for you to write down all the reasons that you love microbiology.

text:Yes I really would. I already feel more motivated! Half an hour ago I felt that I had no place left to go and felt defeated. The seeker feels defeated by the idea of quitting. The supporter can encourage the seeker to continue studying and see if this is the solution.	labels:That's really good, sometimes it is about finding a direction and small steps. Often when we are studying the work seems really big, especially essay questions. One thing that helped me was to break it into really small chunks, sometimes physically covering up some of the question. Would that be something that would help?
text:I have not really tried it but I ought to. I often feel that I am just overwhelmed. Then I know that I got something wrong for definite and I just want to give up.. The seeker feels overwhelmed by work. The supporter could encourage the seeker to take some time to get a new direction.	labels:It could be something you can try, remember , it is not always about ought to, simply how can I make it easier for myself. It is okay to get things wrong too. If you decide to write your list of reasons why you love microbiology, maybe you could keep it in a place you see every day, a mirror or fridge and keep seeing where you are trying to get to..

The supporter could tell the seeker to stay focused on the positive and ask questions. The supporter could also tell the seeker to go to therapy and talk to her friends and family.	labels:Unfortunately men have earned a reputation as jerks for that reason.. Are you still together or have you left?
text:Its crazy. and just when you think you found one with his brain intact, he finds a way to embarrass you. i called it quits.
