text:Good Evening.\nHello. The seeker did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:How are you?
text:I'm pretty stressed out actually. The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker more details to help the seeker.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?
text:Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates. The seeker is stressed because of failing a test. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the professor, get a tutor, or join a study group.	labels:Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?

The supporter could tell the seeker to talk with the professor to get more information about the grade. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a tutor to help with the class.	labels:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise....
text:Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be. The seeker  feels stressed because of the failed test. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the professor and get more information about the grades.

The supporter could tell the seeker that it is not the end of the world and try to encourage the seeker.	labels:If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed!

text:Hmm that sounds .. interesting :D. Is that a metaphor?. The seeker  feels really betrayed by her partner and she has trust issues with men. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a friend to rely upon and watch the Brene Brown video on YouTube with the cartoon animal about empathy.	labels:that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!
text:I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship.

The seeker  feels sad and angry because of the recent break-up. The supporter should be empathetic and try to offer some advice.	labels:I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with..
text:I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out. The seeker  feels sad and upset because the seeker's girlfriend is moving away. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the girlfriend about the feelings and try to work things out.	labels:How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to do something to make the seeker feel better like reading books or pick up a new hobby.	labels:You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.
text:Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word. Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later. The seeker  feels sad because of the break up.

The seeker  feels despair because of the lack of social contact. The supporter could tell the seeker some creative ways to meet people, such as joining an online book club or game night.	labels:I understand. Try sticking to the basics to make it less stressful. Wear a mask outside at a distance..
text:I always do wear a mask.. I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again..

I am worried that if this lasts much longer I will end up deep in debt. The seeker  feels anxious about the pandemic and the current state of affairs. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and family about the feelings to get more supports.

text:I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched.. The seeker  feels despair because of the lockdown. The supporter could tell the seeker to join some online communities to share experiences.	labels:That is true it has been hard for many people..

The supporter could suggest the seeker to take a break or talk to friends about how the seeker is feeling.	labels:Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip..
text:I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out.. The seeker  feels depressed and isolated because of the Covid.

I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way..

The supporter could suggest the seeker to take a walk at the park and work out.	labels:You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.
text:good advice. I will try. The seeker  feels depressed because of the Covid and the election. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find something to enjoy every day and to stay positive.	labels:Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?
text:Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude. The seeker  feels stressed and worried about the current situation. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some deep breath and try to change the attitude to be more positive.	labels:Positive attitudes are never bad, slightly annoying to some first thing in the morning but in a good way. lol.
text:Yes, I need coffee first! Thank you for your advice! The seeker  feels stressed and worried about things that she cannot change. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a deep breath and try to think about things that she can control.	labels:Coffee sounds good. You are welcome and thank you for sharing!
text:Happy Thanksgiving:) The seeker  feels stressed and worried about things that the seeker cannot change. The supporter could tell the seeker to take deep breath and think positive attitude.	labels:Happy Thanksgiving to you as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Good Afternoon. How are you doing troday?
text:I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it. The seeker  feels ashamed and worried about his girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to feel that way and offer some resources to help the seeker feel better.	labels:Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through..
text:Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. The seeker  feels ashamed and he is worried that his girlfriend may be cheating on him. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the girlfriend about the feeling and try to get more evidence to make sure the girlfriend is cheating on him or not.	labels:I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
text:What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? The seeker  feels ashamed and worried about the girlfriend may cheat on the seeker. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is hard to have a relationship when the trust is being destroyed.	labels:Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.
text:I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends. The seeker  feels ashamed and sad because the seeker's girlfriend may be cheating. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the girlfriend about the situation and try to figure out the solution together.	labels:Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
text:I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. The seeker  feels ashamed, sad and he has low self-esteem. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not the only one who has the same experiences and sharing the similar experiences could make the seeker feel better.	labels:Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
text:That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way! The seeker  feels ashamed of himself because he suspects that the girlfriend is cheating. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the girlfriend directly and communicate more often.	labels:Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
text:very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? The seeker  feels ashamed, worried and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that the first step is to talk to the girlfriend about the situation and try to get more evidence.	labels:Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
text:not at all. I appreciate your candour. The seeker  feels worried and ashamed because of the girlfriend cheating on him. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is not the only one have this problem and try to give some suggestions to deal with the issue.	labels:But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
text:All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. The seeker  feels worried that the girlfriend is cheating and the seeker has low self-esteem. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk about the situation with the girlfriend and try to find some evidences.	labels:I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you feeling today?.\nHello. I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible? The seeker  feels OK but has some work issues. The supporter could ask the seeker more about the work issue and try to give some advice.	labels:Of course! What sort of issue is it?.
text:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best. The seeker  feels scared and resentful. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is hard to make a decision and the supporter will try to help the seeker. The supporter could also ask the seeker to list some things that the seeker likes and dislikes about the job.	labels:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?.
text:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! The seeker  feels scared because of changing the career. The supporter could encourage the seeker to try some new things and get some informations about the new career.	labels:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?.
text:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament? The seeker  feels scared and resentful because the job has become full and boring. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the HR department or find other jobs that have the same income.	labels:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!.
text:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one. The seeker  feels worried and scared about the change of career. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and family, look for mentors, and join some supportive group.	labels:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that..
text:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser. The seeker  feels resentful and scared because of the full and boring job. The supporter could tell the seeker to start looking for other opportunities and make a plan to leave the job.	labels:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing..
text:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal? The seeker  feels bored with the current job and wants to find a new job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to start looking for a new job or talk to the current employer about the possibility of a promotion or change in position.	labels:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?.
text:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years. The seeker  feels bored and resentful about the current job. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for another job and update resume. The supporter could also ask the seeker about the qualifications and experiences.	labels:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?.
text:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-) The seeker  feels resentful and stuck in the same job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and family to see if they could help find a new job. The supporter could also tell the seeker to update the resume and post it online.	labels:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!.
text:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things. The seeker  feels worried about their future and bored about the current job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends, family or other social networks. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a new job.	labels:No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!.
text:Yes true thanks for your understanding. The seeker  feels resentful and scared about the future. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to boss or friends to get more supports.	labels:You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.
text:You have indeed, thanks for this conversation. The seeker  feels resentful, bored, and scared about the job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the boss or find a new job.	labels:Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!.
text:Will do, thanks again! The seeker  feels worried about the future and the job. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always here to help. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to friends or family.	labels:Erm .. cup of coffee?.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon how may I help you today?\nHello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why. The seeker  feels depression and does not know why. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the depression, such as when it started, how long it has been going on, and if anything has changed recently.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
text:No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. The seeker  feels depressed because of the lockdown. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find some social activities online or going outside for a walk.	labels:These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
text:I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. The seeker  feels depressed because of the lockdown. The supporter could suggest the seeker to continue see the psychiatrist and try to do some outdoor activities to get more sunlight.	labels:Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?.
text:Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? The seeker  feels worried and anxious that the depression will continue to get worse. The supporter could suggest the seeker to keep a daily journal to document the emotions. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a support group to share the experiences.	labels:It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
text:What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. The seeker  feels depressed and anxious. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to a professional or join a support group to get more help.	labels:Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app..
text:I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. The seeker  feels depressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to a professional as soon as possible. The supporter could also suggest some apps for the seeker to use.	labels:There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
text:I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? The seeker  feels depressed and worried about the recent increase in depression. The supporter could tell the seeker about some online professional help and some other people's experiences.	labels:After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it..
text:That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. The seeker  feels depressed and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to a professional and try some psychiatry apps.	labels:It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that..
text:I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. The seeker  feels depressed and anxious because of the lockdown. The supporter could suggest the seeker to use some psychiatric apps to talk to a professional.	labels:I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
text:Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. The seeker  feels depressed because of the lockdown. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to reconnect with the psychiatrist and try to find some other resources like support groups or psychiatry apps.	labels:I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. What would you like to discuss today?\nHi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried I. I'm next. The seeker  feels worried about being laid off from the company. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the situation and try to give some suggestions.	labels:My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?
text:Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. The seeker  feels anxious because the seeker may be the next person to get laid off. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the things that the seeker can control. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to join a support group.	labels:So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?
text:Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now. The seeker  feels anxiety because the seeker company has less people. The supporter could tell the seeker to update the resume and start to look for another job. The supporter could also ask the seeker how to reduce the anxiety.	labels:I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?
text:No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now. The seeker  feels anxiety because he is worried about being laid off from work. The supporter could tell the seeker to update the resume and start to look for another job. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to the family and make a plan B.	labels:Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.
text:Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. The seeker  feels anxiety because the seeker may get laid off. The supporter could suggest the seeker to search for new jobs and update the resume. The supporter could also suggest the seeker's family to claim unemployment.	labels:Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments.
text:I'm an owner. What kind of programs? The seeker  feels anxiety about being laid off. The supporter could suggest the seeker to claim unemployment and search for new jobs. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to the mortgage company about the mortgage payment.	labels:Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it.
text:oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion. The seeker  feels anxiety because the seeker is worried about being laid off. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for government programs which could help the seeker in difficult time.	labels:I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
text:yeah how can I make more money on the side? it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good. The seeker  feels anxiety and nervous because the seeker may get laid off. The supporter could tell the seeker some useful information about the unemployment. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to try to find some other jobs.	labels:As there are a lot of people who've lost their jobs the pickins' are quite slim. But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.
text:oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays! The seeker  feels anxiety about being laid off from the job. The supporter could tell the seeker about the government programs and Amazon hiring customer services reps to work from home.	labels:If it's in your area Instacart is also hiring shoppers and delivery drivers. Is that something you might be able to do?	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing today?\nHi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless and has lost motivation. The supporter should ask the seeker why she is feeling that way and try to find solutions together.	labels:I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
text:I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless, and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for professional help or join a support group.	labels:There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
text:I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? The seeker  feels sad, hopeless and her boyfriend is not helpful. The supporter could offer some help like looking for a therapist who has a sliding scale or offer to help find transportation.	labels:It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
text:I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments.. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless, and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is willing to help the seeker. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a therapist.	labels:I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
text:What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless, and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker to find some smaller goals to achieve and look for professional help.	labels:Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
text:I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless and helpless. The supporter could encourage the seeker to keep trying and not give up. The supporter could also offer some resources to the seeker.	labels:How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
text:That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? The seeker  feels sad, hopeless and stuck. The supporter could suggest the seeker to look for online therapist and set simple goals to the seeker. The supporter could also say some words to encourage the seeker.	labels:Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
text:Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now. The seeker  feels sad, hopeless and alone. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is here to help the seeker. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find an online therapist.	labels:Great! I hope for the best for you!	episode_done:True

text:Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. The seeker  feels unhappy and frustrated. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk about specific challenges and provide some conversation instructions.	labels:it's true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?
text:Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. The seeker  feels hard life and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker some good news to make the seeker feel better.	labels:it is like there's a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.
text:How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? The seeker  feels hopeless about life and the future. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the present and try to find some silver linings in the current situation.	labels:the "little black rain cloud" people? LOLI try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it's our first.
text:Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? The seeker  feels fearful and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always there for the seeker. The supporter could also ask the seeker about the hobbies or goals to refocus the seeker's attention.	labels:While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s.
text:I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. The seeker  feels down and helpless because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on things the seeker can control and try to be positive.

text:I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. The seeker  feels unhappy because of the global pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the things that the seeker can control and look back to the historical events.	labels:are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?
text:No but I did love that show as a kid. The seeker  feels hard to deal with the family during the holidays because they focus on the bad things. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the things that make the seeker happy.	labels:Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren't always helpful. anyone in particular for you?
text:My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things. The seeker  feels depressed and worried about the future. The supporter could suggest the seeker to focus on the positive things and look for the helpers.	labels:so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.
text:Yes. I also don't feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. The seeker  feels hard about life and the future. The supporter could suggest the seeker to focus on the present and the things that the seeker can control.	labels:oooh, that's hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways.
text:No but near him and take care of him. The seeker  feels hard about life and the future. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the things that the seeker can control. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to friends or family.	labels:that's really nice of you. i'm 800+ miles away from my parents.
text:That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. The seeker  feels hard to deal with family and the future. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some time for self-care.	labels:if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy.
text:Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help. The seeker  feels scared, frustrated and helpless.

The supporter could say that the seeker deserves better treatment and the supporter is always there for the seeker.	labels:Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?
text:Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not.

The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the friend again and try to figure out the reason why the friend said that.	labels:Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?

The seeker  feels hurt because of the friend's judgement. The supporter could tell the seeker to find some other friends to share similar experiences. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to the friend again to explain the feeling.	labels:I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing.

Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.
text:That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now. The seeker  feels hurt because of the friend's comments. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some time to think about it and try to talk to the friend again.	labels:Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nHello, I'm feeling very anxious about my classes. How are you? The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the classes and try to give some useful suggestions.	labels:I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful.
text:Yeah, especially with the pandemic, it's just been so hard to try and focus. The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter could tell the seeker to take some deep breath or have a break before continue studying.	labels:I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this.
text:Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far. The seeker  is anxious about their classes and the supporter is also anxious about their classes. The supporter can suggest that the seeker tries talking to their classmates or joining a study group.	labels:Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.
text:I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter could suggest the seeker to use different color pens to organize the notes and try to wake up early to get started on an assignment.	labels:Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.
text:I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class. The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up an alarm or find a study group.	labels:I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)
text:I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? The seeker  feels anxious about the classes. The supporter could suggest the seeker to review any notes and use different colored ink for different topics. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to wake up earlier and set up an alarm to get more motivation for the classes.	labels:That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.
text:Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter could suggest the seeker to use different color pens to make the notes more eye-catching. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to wake up earlier.	labels:What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.
text:I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. The seeker  feels anxious about classes. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a routine to have a better control of the time. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to try different learning strategies.	labels:That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.
text:Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot. The seeker  feels anxious because of the pressure from schoolwork. The supporter could suggest the seeker to set up a study plan and find a study group.	labels:I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!	episode_done:True

And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.

In reality everything was fine. There was an explainable reason behind the behaviour and it was nothing bad in the end.

The supporter could tell the seeker to reach out the friend's family or friends on social media to get more information.	labels:That is true.

Life is complicated, they may not have the time for legitimate reasons.
text:That is true. I think they are probably very busy at the moment but as they are typically so outgoing it did strike me as odd. What else would you suggest? The seeker  feels worried about the friend. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to contact other family members or friends to get more information about the friend.	labels:You mentioned that other friends were also concerned about them, have you tried talking to them about setting up a video call with a group.

The supporter could ask the seeker to remember the good experiences during the past interviews and give some specific advices.	labels:Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses?

The supporter could also suggest the seeker to use previous experiences to prepare for the interview.	labels:I can see that you are feeling a large amount of stress about the situation. Would it be possible to take one or more days off from work to give yourself more time?
text:Yes this is very stressful. Have you ever had a similar experience and if so how did you handle it? Potentially but this is very short notice, usually I have to provide more notice for leave from work. The seeker  feels stressed about the interview. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some days off to prepare or get help from friends and family members.	labels:Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?
text:Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. The seeker  feels stressed because of the lack of preparation time for the upcoming interview. The supporter could suggest the seeker to use the spare time to prepare as much as possible. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to ask for help from friends or family.	labels:That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems.

The supporter could suggest some breathing exercises to the seeker.	labels:Well, everyone handles stressful situations differently, but there are some things you can do or try that might help.

You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?
text:There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually! The seeker  feels stressed about the job interview. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to be more positive and focus on the things that the seeker can do.	labels:Be confident in your abilities.

The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is also worried about the future and how the pandemic will play out.	labels:Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. .
text:I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the present and the things the seeker can control.	labels:Or constantly terrified. We can't control the world, or even another person really, but we can control ourselves. .
text:How do you comfort yourself that it's not that bad? The seeker  feels worried about the future due to pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to do something to make the seeker feel better in the present, such as reading, meditating or talking to friends.	labels:Well, I don't try to deny the seriousness of the situation at all.  But I do try to keep myself and my family healthy, physically and mentally, and maintain my close friendships via text/video.
text:Thanks for your insights. It is helpful to talk it out. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the thing that the seeker could control. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to limit the intake of news and social media.	labels:And I schedule my day, even though I'm working and going to school from home.  I schedule breaks to go out and enjoy the fresh air, dance like an idiot to some music, play with my dogs, or whatever is refreshing. .
text:Now is the time to focus and be disciplined.. I will take your advice. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic. The supporter could share some useful information to the seeker. The supporter could also say that the situation is very uncertain these days.	labels:A routine has been really really helpful.  I also make sure to get plenty of sunshine.  As the winter comes in, we have shorter days and it feels suffocating. .
text:Yes, the short days are a major depressant. I feel like those around me dont understand my anxiety. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic and economic downturn. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some actions to make the life more routine and less social media intake.	labels:That must be frustrating.  I've learned there are just some people I can't trust with my vulnerabilities. .
text:I may overtrust. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic and economic downturn. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take a deep breath and relax. The supporter could also ask the seeker to talk about the things can be controlled.	labels:But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it. .
text:You're good at this. Thanks for your support. Ending chat when timer allows. The seeker  feels worried about the future because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the present and what the seeker can control.	labels:Sure thing, I wish you luck, and thank you for the compliment :-) .	episode_done:True
text:Hello I would like to talk to you regarding my daily stresses. The seeker  feels stressed. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:sure, please go ahead and share your story.
text:pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now. The seeker  feels stressed because of the pandemic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?
text:yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc. The seeker  feels depression because of the pandemic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to join an online group or class to meet new people.	labels:that's great! Friends can be big help.
text:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. The seeker  feels frustrated with the abnormal sleep pattern. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try to establish a bed-time routine to go to bed early and wake up early.	labels:If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.
text:So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. The seeker  feels depressed and stressed because of the pandemic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends more often and spend time outdoor.	labels:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.
text:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym. The seeker  feels depressed and anxious because of the social isolation and academic pressure. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go out for a walk and get some fresh air.	labels:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.
text:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. The seeker  feels depression, worried and angry. The supporter could tell the seeker to take some deep breath when feeling angry, try to think positive and talk to friends more often.	labels:I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.
text:But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too. sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. The seeker  feels stressed, anxious and angry. The supporter could tell the seeker some relaxation techniques and try to reduce the amount of daily news the seeker watches.	labels:that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.
text:yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. The seeker  feels stressed, worried and depressed due to social isolation, academic pressure and the pandemic. The supporter could suggest the seeker to go out for a walk, spend time with friends and exercise.	labels:I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.
text:And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good. The seeker  feels overwhelmed, stressed, and lonely. The supporter could encourage the seeker by telling the seeker that the supporter is also struggling with the same issues. The supporter could also give some suggestions to the seeker, such as spending time outdoors and talking with friends.	labels:I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.
text:And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up. Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this. The seeker  feels lonely, frustrated, and anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is also feeling the same way. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to do some exercises to release the pressures.	labels:it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.
text:So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings. The seeker  feels stressed, anxious, lonely, claustrophobic and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a professional help because the seeker has too many negative emotions.	labels:I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.
text:So thank you for that and for listening and understanding. Yes will continue to do that. The seeker  feels stressed and depressed because of the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker to take one day at a time and get help from friends or family.	labels:It was nice talking to you too.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello, how are you doing?
text:I am hanging in there as well as I can be. The seeker  is doing okay. The supporter could ask the seeker how the day is going or if there is anything on the seeker's mind.	labels:What's been going on?
text:I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous. The seeker  feels worried about losing the job. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and share some similar experiences. The supporter could also ask the seeker to find professional therapy.	labels:It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.
text:It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that. The seeker  feels worried about losing the job because of the COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is not permanent and try to find some potential jobs.	labels:Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.
text:Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability. The seeker  feels worried about losing her job because of the COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker some possible solutions to deal with the stress such as looking for other jobs.	labels:I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?
text:Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.. The seeker  feels stressed because of the fear of losing the job. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the positive things and try to find a new job as soon as possible.	labels:I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.
text:I would hope so. The seeker  feels worried about losing the job because of the COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker about the resources which can be provided by the government.	labels:I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.
text:Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away. The seeker  feels nervous about losing the job because of the COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker some suggestion about seeking for a new job.	labels:I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.
text:For the record, you are doing a really really good job. I really appreciate your time and kind words. Thank you for empathizing and relating. I appreciate your assistance. I feel a lot better about this now :). The seeker  feels stressed about losing the job because of the COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the good things that the seeker has done. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to take some actions to prevent from losing the job.	labels:You are very welcome. (: It's my pleasure to help in any way I can.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHi. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:What can I help you with today?
text:I've been feeling really sad lately. I think I have depression. The seeker  feels sad and may have depression. The supporter could ask the seeker more about the reasons causing the sadness. The supporter could also introduce some hotlines or professional therapy to the seeker.	labels:Is there any reason that triggered  your sadness?
text:It's 2020 so there's been a lot going on, but I've been struggling with this before all of that. 2020 has made it much worse though. The seeker  feels sad and think the seeker has depression. The supporter could explore the reasons of the depression with the seeker and look for solutions together.	labels:I am sorry you feel this way. Do you live with friends or family?
text:I live on my own... well at least as the only human. I have a dog. The seeker  feels sad and has depression. The supporter should ask the seeker about thoughts of suicide and if the seeker has any support system.	labels:That is great that you at least have your dog. They're great companion.
text:She is amazing and my love and joy. On days I feel I cannot get out of bed and I don't have work, I get up for her. The seeker  feels sad and has depression. The supporter could tell the seeker to get help from family or friends. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get a professional help.	labels:How about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?
text:I wish. We haven't had the time recently to connect due to being so busy. Do you have any tips or ticks for things I can do by myself? The seeker  feels sad and has depression. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a counseling group or join some activities.	labels:Of course. Now that covid is closing everything. You can use that time to take a course online for free. Or you can pursue your hobbies.
text:Right. Online courses are fun. The seeker  feels sad because of the 2020. The supporter could suggest some useful and positive activities for the seeker to do by himself.	labels:Have you tried seeking therapist?
text:I need to. I just haven't had the money to see one. They're expensive. The seeker  feels sad because of the 2020. The supporter could recommend the seeker to seek therapist to help the seeker to get over the sadness.	labels:I think there are quite a few hotline for free, obviously not as good as your personal one, however you can use that when you need to talk to an expert.
text:Yeah.... The seeker  feels sad and has depression. The supporter could tell the seeker to take more actions like seeking therapist or joining some activities.	labels:I understand how you feel, I also find myself more depressed this year than ever.
text:2020 has not been fun to say the least. I am hoping 2021 is a much better year. Thank you for listening to me. The seeker  feels sad and depressed because of 2020. The supporter could tell the seeker to take care of himself/herself and try to do something fun every day. The supporter could also recommend some hotlines for the seeker to talk.	labels:Me too, I have been trying to teach myself the "one day at a time" mindset to not being paranoid about the future.	episode_done:True
text:hi. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:im good. getting tired. had a long day. hola? The seeker  feels tired. The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a rest or take a nap.	labels:It sounds like you worked really hard today. How are you taking care of yourself?
text:im good. just talked to my friend who is going in for heart surgery next week. The seeker  feels tired and worried about her friend. The supporter could tell the seeker to get some rest and maybe sending a healing message to her friend.	labels:That must be really hard. I'm glad that you were able to make time for your friend who is going through a difficult time.
text:thank ya. yeah it's important im there for him right now. he has to be nervous. they're going to open 4 or 5 valves.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to get some rest or sleep.	labels:It sounds like you are handling the situation well, given the stressful circumstance.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to have a good rest or doing relaxation activities.	labels:It's wonderful that you have a support network that you trust and that you can talk with about this. I know that talking through things is really helpful for me too. Have you considered seeking professional help during this time?
text:nope. i feel that i get enough support from family. it might've been an option if I didn't have a strong support system. The seeker  feels tired and stressed because of a friend who is going through a heart surgery. The supporter could suggest the seeker to take care of himself/herself first and get some rest.	labels:That's fantastic. Having family around during a tough season like this must be such a blessing. It's great that you can be there for your friend, almost as if they were part of your family, too.
text:yeah they feel like part of the family. i've known them since i was in college 20 years ago. we haven't always talked the whole time but.... The seeker  feels tired and stressed because of the friend's heart surgery. The supporter could suggest the seeker to get some rest and talk about the situation with family or friends.	labels:20 years is a long time! It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!
text:thank ya. him and I are there for each other. We dated briefly at first but have been friends ever since. He said I was the one who got away. But he was the one who ended it lol. The seeker  feels tired but is in a good mood because the supporter is talking with the seeker about the things the seeker is doing. The supporter could ask the seeker more about the situation and how the seeker feels about it.	labels:It sounds like you and him have had quite the history, but your friendship has proven to remain strong through thick and thin (20 years!). I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be for him to be waiting for surgery, and I'm sure it means the world to him that you are by his side. How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?
text:It's been good. We've been talking about Covid and the election too. I know I'd be nervous to go in for heart surgery. The seeker  feels tired and stressed because of the long day and the friend who is going in for heart surgery. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a break and get some rest. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to other friends to get more support.	labels:That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other?
text:just being there for each other as a listening ear. The seeker  feels nervous because the friend is going to have heart surgery. The supporter could suggest the seeker to be more active to do something instead of only being a listening ear.	labels:It's so easy to feel alone these days.

text:Yes but how much time? The seeker  feels sad because of the death of the fiance. The supporter should be empathetic and try to understand the seeker's feeling. The supporter could also suggest some activities to the seeker to help ease the pain.	labels:Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.
text:I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him. The seeker  feels sad because of the lost of the fiance. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter also experienced the same thing. The supporter could also say that it is normal to miss the fiance and gradually the frequency to think about the fiance will become lower.	labels:I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.
text:Yes, I do try.  Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward? The seeker  feels sad because of the death of the fiance. The supporter could share the similar experiences and tell the seeker how to cherish the happy memories.	labels:I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?
text:Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle. The seeker  feels sad because the fiance died four years ago. The supporter could encourage the seeker to cherish the happy memories and try to think of the good times.	labels:That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?
text:actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you. i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well. The seeker  is sad because of the death of the fiance. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk about happy memories with the fiance.	labels:Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.
text:i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself. I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals. The seeker  feels sad because of the death of the fiance. The supporter could tell the seeker to cherish the happy memories and try to find a new hobby to cope.	labels:I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?
text:hmmm.  i love tacos.  and stews.  cheesecake. i used to bake ... but i'm diabetic so that's probably not such a good idea any more.  and since we're working at home now i can't bake and take it into the office for people to enjoy. The seeker  feels sad because of the death of her fiance. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do something to remember her fiance such as looking at old pictures or writing down memories.	labels:Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.
text:oh my yes, the Cheesecake Factory has amazing cheesecake. I am going to go now. Thank you very much for your support. It helps to have an "ear" ... just to be able to talk about it and be reminded that it's all going to be okay.  Plus, that there's cheesecake in the world, so it can't all be bad, right? The seeker  feels sad because today is the day when the fiance died four years ago. The supporter could comfort the seeker by sharing the similar experience. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to focus on happy memories and try to think about the good things in life.	labels:Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you today?\nIm okay. How do you want to do this? The seeker  is okay. The supporter could ask about the seeker's day or how the seeker is feeling.	labels:Sure! Can you please tell me how can i help you today?
text:Ive been feeling like other people dont like me. The seeker  feels like other people dont like the seeker. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk more about the feeling and try to find the reasons to why the seeker feels that way.	labels:If I understand you correctly, do you assume people dislike you even if you can't tell for sure?
text:Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary. The seeker  feels valueless and unliked by others. The supporter could encourage the seeker to think more positively and to give people the benefit of the doubt.	labels:It seems you are a bit low on self-confidence. I have been there too. If I may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?
text:Yeah, I've been texting my friend and he doesn't reply to me for hours and it makes me feel like he isnt as enthusiastic about our friendship as i am which hurts. The seeker  feels low self-confidence and has a hurt feeling. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to feel down sometimes and offer some advice.	labels:Right, the feeling of being ignored can be quite overwhelming. Have you tried speaking with your friend over phone or video call, assuming you have access to the technology?
text:We have decent phone conversations, I guess I'm just frustrated and sad about my worthiness, now that im typing it out it sounds not nearly as bad. Thank you. The seeker  feels low self-confidence and overwhelmed. The supporter could suggest the seeker to do some outdoor activities or talk to friends more often to get more social support.	labels:Great! You are worthy! Remember that always :) Is there anything else I can help you with?
text:Haha thank you. What do you think i should do when i feel this way next time. The seeker  feels sad and frustrated because the friend ignores the seeker. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the friend directly to share the feeling. The supporter could also tell the seeker to do something to make the seeker happy.	labels:Good question! Don't let the feeling consume you. After all , you are dealing with another person who genuinely might be busy or held up with some important work.
text:Thats true. The seeker  feels sad and frustrated because the friend is not replying to the texts. The supporter could tell the seeker to have phone conversations or meet in person to have a better communication.	labels:So, even if they don't respond, just think they are driving or working, and try to avoid thinking that you are being ignored.
text:I always assume since im not busy that they arent too. I guessits a little self involved. The seeker  feels low self-confidence and frustrated. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the friend and try to spend more time with the friend. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to join some group activities.	labels:Yes, sometimes assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. Always talk it out when you get a chance. It could be, but always bear in mind that there could be factors beyond your immediate control.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you doing?  How can I help you?\nhello. i have constant anxiety about my future and job applications. The seeker  feels anxious about the future.

When did this start?
text:probably in the last 3 or so months. The seeker  feels anxious about future and job applications. The supporter could ask the seeker to talk more about the reasons to cause the anxiety.

text:not exactly. I just have started researching programs and the application process that I will have to start soon and it has been overwhelming. The seeker  feels anxious about future and job applications. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on one thing at a time and set up a timeline.	labels:That sounds like a challenge but you can be proud that you are working so hard.
text:thank you I really appreciate that. The seeker  feels anxious about the future and job applications. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is normal to have some anxiety about the future and job applications.	labels:Do you have anyone who can help support you through the process?

text:Yeah i guess ill give zoom a try. do you and your friends do anything on zoom or just chat? The seeker  feels sad that cannot meet up with friends since March. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to use Zoom for meeting up with friends and also tell the seeker some activities could do on Zoom.	labels:And if you have an iphone facetime some folks.  Zoom and Facetime are my friends now.  lol I almost daily at least Facetime my best friend. Especially in the evenings.
text:Yeah I think ill try that. Chatting with my friends and seeing them (online) will hopefully make me feel better. thanks :) The seeker  feels sad because of not hanging out with friends. The supporter could tell the seeker to do something fun with friends online like playing games or watching movies together.	labels:I would try it.  Also Meetup is doing virtual meetings. . You're welcome!  We have to look out for one another!
text:Ill give them a shot :) thanks for your time. have  a good day. The seeker  feels sad because the seeker has not been able to see friends since March. The supporter suggests the seeker to try Zoom or Facetime to chat with friends. The seeker feels better after the conversation.	labels:Sounds good! You're more than welcome.  You do the same.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, how are you today?\nokay right now. The seeker  is okay. The supporter should ask the seeker what is going on.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?
text:i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad. The seeker  feels okay right now, but the supporter should be aware that the seeker may feel depressed because of the limited social interaction. The supporter could ask the seeker to join social activities online or offline.	labels:That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out..
text:i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good. The seeker  feels sad because the seeker is isolated from the society. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always here to listen to the seeker. The supporter could also tell the seeker some good news to cheer the seeker up.	labels:That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.
text:she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done.  she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality.  her background is similiar to mine,  i cannot abandon her as her other family has done. The seeker  feels sad and worried about the cousin. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the cousin's treatment team to get more supports or find other family members to get help from.	labels:That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?
text:on antidepressant meds, COVID makes it hard to keep in touch with provider, your comparison about the oxygen mask is a good one. . The seeker  feels lonely and helpless because the seeker is not able to take care of the cousin. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a professional help to deal with the current situation.	labels:I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.
text:a possible path to look into. thanks. The seeker  feels sad and depressed because of the limited social support. The supporter could tell the seeker to look for some social activities or groups to get more support.	labels:Of course, here's the link: namimainlinepa.org/online-and-telephone-support-groups/.
text:thanks. may be a good time to close on a positive note.  like suggestions. The seeker  feels sad and lonely because of the Troubled cousin and COVID. The supporter could tell the seeker to find some professional supports and therapies to help the seeker.	labels:Sounds good. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?
text:not right now but thanks for your concern. The seeker  feels sad because of the limited social support. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always here to talk and suggest some mental health resources.	labels:Alright. You're welcome, it's what I'm here for. I hope you have a good rest of your day!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello :)
text:This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as others? The seeker  feels inferior because of the new job. The supporter could encourage the seeker that it need some time to get used to the new environment. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to the supervisor for more help.	labels:So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?
text:that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? The seeker  feels like not measuring up to the co-workers. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is normal to feel that way and suggest the seeker to talk to the co-workers to get to know them better.	labels:I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job. I am sure that with time you will get the same results as them if not better! Are there any co-workers you feel close to or see a friendship developing with?
text:that's nice of you to say but I also don't feel as organised. I suppose that's to be understood in a new job scenario.. Yes there are a few really nice co-workers. The seeker  feels like not measuring up to her co-workers. The supporter could tell the seeker co-workers are not better than the seeker, just have more experience. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to get close to some co-workers.	labels:Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started..
text:I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to? The seeker  feels like not measuring up to the co-works. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is normal to feel that way and it is okay to ask co-workers for help.	labels:That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
text:I suppose it's difficult to know when something is too much for you or if you need to give it more time.. The seeker  feels like she is not good enough for the job because her co-workers have more experience than her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is new in the job and has a lot of potentials. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to ask co-workers for help.	labels:I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.
text:Thankshe problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks. The seeker  feels stressed and overwhelmed because the seeker has been working really hard to get a better position. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is important to take care of self and know the limits.	labels:I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
text:Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself? The seeker  feels like not measuring up to the co-workers and feel stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter also has experienced the similar situation and the seeker is not alone. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to friends.	labels:Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all..
text:Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me. The seeker  feels like she is not good enough because her co-workers have more experience than her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to ask for help from co-workers or find a mentor.	labels:Of course you are not alone!
text:I think I'll give this a good few weeks and ask myself how I think I'm doing then go from there. Thanks for the chat and your suggestions. The seeker  feels overwhelmed with the new job because the seeker cannot get on after several weeks. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a step back and ask the seeker how the seeker has been doing recently.	labels:I think that is a great idea I wish you luck! Remember no matter what you will find somewhere you belong!	episode_done:True
text:Hi. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:hello, how are you?
text:Honestly I'm not doing too great. hbu. The seeker  feels not good. The supporter could ask the seeker about the reason to show concern.	labels:I'm doing ok, Is there anything you would like to chat about?
text:Yeah my long time partner cheated on me recently and I just found out. I havent been able to see them in awhile because of lock down and now they tell me this :( The seeker  feels sad because the seeker's long time partner cheated on the seeker. The supporter could provide some comforting words and tell the seeker that the supporter is here for the seeker.	labels:That is horrible I am so sorry they done that to you.
text:thanks. its just been such a hard couple of months because of the virus. And now with this I just dont know what to do. The seeker  feels sad because the seeker's partner cheated on the seeker. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always there for the seeker. The supporter could also ask the seeker about what the seeker wants to do after the conversation.	labels:I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is.
text:Yeah its an awful feeling and I just feel really sad. The seeker  feels sad because her long time partner cheated on her. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter has also been cheated on in the past.	labels:I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out.
text:I haven't spoken to anyone yet I dont want to bother anyone. The seeker  feels sad and heartbroken after finding out the partner cheated. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is nothing to do with the seeker and it is all the partner. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to friends or family members.	labels:don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.
text:Yeah I guess I should talk to someone about it. what else do you think I should do? The seeker  feels sad and frustrated because the seeker's partner cheated on the seeker. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker is not the only one who has been cheated on and that the seeker is not alone.	labels:When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.
text:Yeah maybe I should try that. What else do you think would help? The seeker  feels sad and frustrated because her long-time partner cheated on her. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends or family members, write a letter to the partner and try to build self confidence.	labels:letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again.
text:Yeah I definitely will not be going back to them. They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again. The seeker  feels sad because the seeker's long time partner cheated on the seeker recently. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter also experienced the same thing before and share some tips to the seeker.	labels:exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them.
text:yeah. thanks for sharing your experience with me. I feel a little better now :) The seeker  feels sad and heartbroken because the seeker's partner cheated on the seeker. The supporter could share some experiences and provide some suggestions to the seeker.	labels:you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you. you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you.
text:Thank you :) Thank you for spending the time to chat with me I hope you have a great day. The seeker  feels sad and hurt because the seeker's long-time partner cheated. The supporter could provide useful suggestions to the seeker and be a good listener.	labels:Anytime, I hope you have a great day as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker  did greeting. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello.  How's it going?
text:I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions. The seeker  feels negative because of the constant lockdowns and restrictions. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find something positive in every day.	labels:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?
text:I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now. The seeker  feels negative because of the constant lockdowns. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find some positive things to focus on.	labels:I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary! .
text:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation. The seeker  feels sad and has low motivation because of the current situation of the UK. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk about the feeling to friends or join some online support groups.	labels:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
text:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? The seeker  feels sad and has low motivation because of the constant lockdowns. The supporter could say that the seeker is not alone in this feeling and that many people are going through the same thing. The supporter could also suggest meeting friends online or on a video call.	labels:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.
text:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself? The seeker  feels sad and low motivated because of the emotional state from the constant lockdowns. The supporter could tell the seeker to do more things that the seeker enjoys and meet more people virtually.	labels:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.
text:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this? The seeker  feels sad and low motivated because of the constant lockdowns and restrictions. The supporter could tell the seeker to find some motivation and try to meet friends online to boost mood.	labels:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
text:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also? The seeker  feels down because of the lockdown. The supporter could recommend the seeker to try to reach out to friends and have fun conversations. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to join a support group.	labels:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?
text:I've never heard of this, what is it? The seeker  feels sad because of the lockdown. The supporter could tell the seeker to join some online communities or make some friends online.	labels:It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
text:I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free? The seeker  feels sad because of the lockdown. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to meet friends online and read books to get mind off the current situation.	labels:Totally free!
text:I like the sound of that, thanks for your help. The seeker  feels low motivated and sad because of the current situation. The supporter could suggest some activities to make the seeker feel better. The supporter could also suggest some resources to the seeker.	labels:You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.
text:thank you for the vote of confidence. The seeker  feels sad and depressed because of the current situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find some hobbies to focus on and meet new friends.	labels:Very welcome!	episode_done:True
text:hello how are you today?\nHi there. I'm OK but have had a difficult time at work recently. The seeker  feels OK but have difficult time at work recently. The supporter should ask more details about the work situation.	labels:i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?
text:Yes I have been given what I can only describe as ridiculous feedback by my manager and it had annoyed me greatly. I'm thinking about complaining about it. The seeker  feels angry and frustrated. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the manager directly to solve the problem.	labels:It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?
text:I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something? The seeker  feels annoyed because of bad feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to speak with the manager to resolve the feelings.	labels:Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.
text:I'm thinking perhaps I should go to a different manager and voice these concerns. I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me. The seeker  feels annoyed about the feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to approach the manager in a polite way to try to resolve the feelings.	labels:Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.
text:yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future. The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me. The seeker  feels frustrated, annoyed and unhappy because of the ridiculous feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to speak with other manager or try to talk to the first manager again.	labels:Yes i can see where that would be a problem.
text:perhaps I'm just making too much of a big deal about this. how would you react if someone gave you similar feedback in work? The seeker  feels frustrated, annoyed and angry because of the feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to the manager about the feelings and try to resolve the feelings.	labels:Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?
text:I haven't actually thought about that as a solution but that might work actually. I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally. The seeker  feels frustrated and annoyed because of the feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to speak to another manager about the situation and try to find a solution.	labels:Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.
text:I think that's an interesting perspective. she might have issues herself and be taking them out on members of her team in work which is quite sad really. Do you think I should just be blunt and ask her the question? The seeker  feels angry and frustrated because of the feedback from the manager. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to different manager or try to get to know the current manager better.	labels:I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.
text:so be supportive but also make it clear that what she has said has had an impact on me? The seeker  feels frustrated, annoyed and hurt because of the feedback from the manager. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to the manager about the feelings and try to get more understandings about the feedback.	labels:Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
text:ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice. The seeker  feels annoyed, frustrated and angry because of the ridiculous feedback from the manager. The supporter could tell the seeker to speak to the manager about the feedback and try to resolve the feelings.	labels:In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.	episode_done:True
text:Hello :) The seeker  did greetings. The supporter should also do greetings.	labels:Hello how are you doing today?
text:I'm doing well how bout yourself? The seeker  feels fine. The supporter should ask about the seeker's day or how the seeker is doing lately.	labels:I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?
text:I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. I havent been doing as well since covid. and I'm kind of upset at my self for it. The seeker  feels down about school recently. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is normal to feel down about school because of the COVID. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to talk to the teacher or join a study group.	labels:Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.
text:Yeah the online schooling is tough for me. I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school. I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( The seeker  feels down about school and is not motivated because of the online schooling. The supporter could tell the seeker to try joining some online clubs or communities related to the seeker's interests. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to reach out to friends more often.	labels:I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)
text:the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it. sure thing :) share. The seeker  feels down because of school and the virus. The supporter could share some experiences and tell the seeker some useful methods to deal with the down feeling.	labels:Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.
text:You bring up a good point about changing environment. I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight. Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :) I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them. The seeker  feels down about school. The supporter could tell the seeker to change the routine, try new things and get more sunlight.	labels:Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :) You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around.
text:Yeah maybe I should do that. The seeker  feels down about school and the current situation. The supporter could suggest the seeker to try different things to make the days more joyful.	labels:And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!
text:gotta switch things up. Yeah I should chat with my friends more too. Its hard to fine time but I should try. The seeker  feels down because of the school and the virus. The supporter could suggest the seeker to talk to friends and change the routine.	labels:It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)
text:very very true especially in these difficult times. Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap. and everythiung can go back to normal. The seeker  feels down about school, unmotivated, and isolated. The supporter could tell the seeker about the importance of social interaction and maintaining a routine.	labels:Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then.
text:Yeah thank you for your advice ill try implementing them in my life more. I feel much better now :) thank you for your time. The seeker  feels down about school and the self. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter also has the same feeling. The supporter could also suggest some solutions to the seeker. The seeker feels better after the conversation.	labels:Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Are you there? The seeker  is checking if the supporter is still there. The supporter should answer the seeker.	labels:goodness  i am so sorry! my browser did not make a noise. how are you doing? sorry i kept you waiting!
text:That is okay! I'm glad you're here. The seeker  feels okay. The supporter should ask how the seeker is doing.	labels:Awww, thanks. How are things going in your world today?
text:I'm doing alright I suppose, just trying to do a few mturk tasks to feel like I'm accomplishing something. Waiting to hear back from unemployment and not hearing back from any job applications makes it hard to ever really relax. The seeker  feels anxious and stressed because of not hearing back from job applications. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay and suggest the seeker to look for other jobs.	labels:Ah, i hear you. The lack of response makes it really easy for me to make up stories in my head and fear the worst.
text:I've never done any computer based jobs before, I did live audio and carpentry before this, so I just feel like I don't qualify for anything, but I'm immune compromised so until this is over i don't know what other work I can safely do besides for something from my computer.... I just feel so terribly stuck. The seeker  feels terrible because the seeker is stuck in the current situation. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the positive things and try to find some solutions.	labels:I'm sorry. I know the feeling of not knowing where I fit in. Its a whole world shift, too.
text:I haven't received any financial assistance from the government yet, I've been living off of loans from friends and what little of my art I've been able to sell. It's stressful. I just want my life back. I felt like I was on a really good career path at the first of the year, and now I just don't even know what o do. The seeker  feels stressed because of the uncertainity of the future. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is always there for the seeker. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to look for some volunteer work or online courses to learn new skills.	labels:That scattered feeling....trying to put the pieces back together....I've walked the same road this year. Would you be willing to mourn for what you had before? To let it go?

The seeker  feels helpless to change the situation and stressed about finding a job. The supporter could suggest the seeker to find a part-time job or look for other income options.	labels:Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar.

I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.

I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.

Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?
text:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens. I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult. The seeker  feels anxiety because of the job. The supporter could tell the seeker to find a better way to deal with the situation, such as talk to her co-worker or look for a new job.	labels:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down.

text:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally.

text:Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \ The seeker  feels sad and disappointed because the seeker failed the college finals. The supporter could encourage the seeker by telling some useful strategies.	labels:Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.

The supporter could suggest the seeker to take some online courses and makes an educational plan.	labels:You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!
text:Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive. The seeker  feels stressed and down because of failing the college finals. The supporter could give some useful tips to the seeker and build up the seeker's confidence.	labels:And you will succeed in that goal. You have the motivation and the care for it, you just need to focus on managing everything at once! Have you thought about meeting with an academic advisor and laying out a plan?	episode_done:True

text:Good afternoon, what can I help you with today? .\nHi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then.

The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to feel that way and offer some coping strategies like going outside for a walk in the daylight.	labels:There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.

Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. . As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.
text:Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule. And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger. The seeker  feels sad and depressive.

As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. . The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you "need" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing. .
text:Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it.

And co-workers often can help you find ways to avoid him in the office. Are others aware of the relationship who can help you with that?
text:My friends don't know about my situation with Doug. I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more.+ Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go?

The seeker  feels frustrated and heartbroken because the seeker is not getting the emotional support from Doug. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is not going anywhere and the supporter could suggest the seeker to reach out to friends.	labels:I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration.

text:I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem. The seeker  feels frustrated because the supporter keeps saying that it is good to reach out. The supporter could suggest the seeker to join some activities to avoid the interaction with Doug.	labels:You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem.

The seeker  feels frustrated and helpless. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends and family for supports. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to take some time for herself/himself.	labels:I wouldn't say that Doug's wife is part of the problem. She's sounds like another victim of his philandering and dishonesty..
text:Why do you keep focusing on the wife? You make it sound if I just kill her Doug and I could be happy and I wouldn't have to worry about his Philandering as you call it anymore. Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? The seeker  feels frustrated because the supporter keeps mentioning about the wife. The supporter should tell the seeker that it is not a good idea to think about killing the wife.	labels:You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.
text:You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it?

The seeker  feels frustrated, because the supporter keeps talking about the wife. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is not in the same situation.	labels:I absolutely have had my heart broken, yes. And I've spent some holidays alone. I can understand your pain.
text:I'm glad you understand my pain. I've spent and know how to be by myself. What I'm asking you how do I get out being in love with someone? The seeker  feels frustrated because the supporter seems to evade the question. The supporter should be more direct and honest with the seeker.	labels:It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not "the one." He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.
text:Okay so I eat Thanksgiving alone and I spend time alone. Okay tell me how i fill my nights alone up? How do I warm the other side of my bed which Doug fill so well. I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not! Also, I don't think being with Doug is settling! I do however appreciate your time and effort.. The seeker  feels frustrated because the supporter cannot provide a easy solution.

The supporter could suggest some relaxation methods or breathing exercises.	labels:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the "pause" of the pandemic. Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?

The supporter could suggest the seeker to do some relaxation techniques and to keep busy.	labels:Absolutely, and it's completely understandable, but it's very hard to wait.

I think you are on the right track to getting through this..

text:yup.. i have 3 kids and i am not married. i have no beneftits. The seeker  feels burned out from work. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is hard to work when the seeker has no benefits. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to find a new job.	labels:She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits.

I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on.  I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews.  You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids.  I would be surprised if he did not understand that.. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on..
