text:Good Evening.\nHello. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:How are you?
text:I'm pretty stressed out actually. The seeker feels stressed out and wants to talk about it. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people that can help her.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. It's rough to get stressed. Would you like to tell me what's going on?
text:Sure. I just failed a huge test in my college class, and I'm worried it will fail me the entire class, and then I won't be able to get my associates. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Oh no! I can totally understand why you're stressing over that! Absolutely valid reason for anxiety. May I ask how much of the whole grade was the test's percentage?
text:Yeah it's really weighing down on me. It's the only thing I can think about. The test was worth 75% The seeker feels stressed and worries that she won't be able to get her associate's degree. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has people around her to help.	labels:What was you're score?
text:I got a 62% on the test. The seeker feels stressed, worried, and lonely. The supporter is also stressed, but for different reasons.	labels:That isn't TECHNICALLY a failed grade by the standards of most professors. Albeit a low grade, it's a D. Anything below 59% would qualify as failed. .
text:Yeah, but taking into account my scores on homework, I don't think it's enought to pass the class. The seeker feels stressed about her grade. The supporter could tell her that she is not alone, many people are going through the same thing.	labels:Have you done fairly well in other classes? How have your grades been prior to this test in that class?
text:Honestly it's just kind of all over the place. I am surviving in other classes, but with all this online stuff with the pandemic I barely learn anything. I'm basically faking it til I make it. Which I hate. But I can't learn in these conditions. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason for the stress is not mentioned.	labels:I hate that you feel that way about yourself, but I can also relate to having a rough time learning via online classes. I'm the same way. However, that does not disable you from being able to learn. It impedes your quality of learning, no doubt. But it isn't something that YOU can help.. By having an attitude of being unable to learn, you automatically lower your expectations for the success you would potentially have otherwise....
text:Yeah that's true, I just think it's not my learning style so it's a lot harder for me. I thought about waiting until things are normal enough to physically be able to go back to class before I try and finish my bachelors, but who knows when that will be. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason isn't mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:OMGoodness no kidding. This whole pandemic has the world in a tizzy!.
text:Yeahhh. Honestly just talking to someone and letting it out was kinda nice. made me feel ebtter. The seeker is feeling stressed because of a failing grade. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has the ability to recover from this failing grade.	labels:If I were you I would not wait! It may not be the best option for your learning style, and it will certainly prove a greater challenge. However, taking on that challenge will bring on SWEETER rewards when you succeed! Adopt a "Can-Do" state of mind and grab the bull by the horns! You're so very welcome!.	episode_done:True

text:and i also havent spoken to no one about it. The seeker has moved on from the event and still has feelings of anger and betrayal.

The seeker feels lonely and her partner cheated on her. The supporter could suggest that the seeker try to look for a way to move away from her partner for good.	labels:before you take any action, i'd ask myself what are your options? you know that his actions have very little to do with you and more to do with him, right?

The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:i'm totally into the podcasts "a slob comes clean" basically it's about getting your poop in a group.
text:Hmm that sounds .. interesting :D. Is that a metaphor?. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter is able to give her some interesting points to share with the seeker.	labels:that's so hard. imagine how much energy he had to use to keep his lives from colliding. he couldn't find a better use for that energy?!
text:I know, right!! Do you think it would be helpful for me to try and talk to this woman and see how she feels? I dunno if she even realises that he was in a committed relationship. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:yes! LOL but it's been helping me focus my anxiety into being a bit more productive.
text:Anything that will help me with my anxiety is worth trying at the moment.. The seeker feels worried, lonely, sad, angry, disappointed, and a bit of annoyance with the supporter.	labels:what do you want to hear from her? is there anything she could say that woudl make you feel better? NO!! she's not going to be able to help you unless you need a witness for divorce court.

text:Well technically it was a mutual agreement but i feel like I dont want this to happen. So what are you up to? Hello? Are you there? The seeker feels lonely, has a hard time contacting the supporter, and is worried about the supporter not answering. The supporter suggests the seeker think about what she wants and can do.	labels:Was there a reasoning behind your decision? Sometimes we let our anger and emotions make our decisions for us.

The seeker feels like she has a reason to break up with her girlfriend. The supporter can empathize with the seeker and helps the seeker feel accepted.	labels:I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with..
text:I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her girlfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has many friends and that she is not alone.	labels:How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.
text:We were together for two years. Im trying my best to go through this. I hope so. Thanks for all those words. It really helps. The seeker has a lot of stress. The supporter can tell the seeker that she can find comfort and support from her friends and family. The supporter can also tell the seeker that the relationship can be rebuilt and that she is not alone.	labels:You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.

The seeker needs to ask the supporter for a way to cope with the lockdown. The supporter may suggest the seeker see friends or family.	labels:Digital contact does have its limitations. Could you meet with people outside at a distance?
text:Well, part of the problem with that is that I am not sure what the rules are any more! We have been told so many different things that I am out of the loop.. The seeker feels isolated and lonely. The supporter could tell that the seeker needs to meet with people in person to feel supported.	labels:I understand. Try sticking to the basics to make it less stressful. Wear a mask outside at a distance..
text:I always do wear a mask.. I think we legally have to :). I really miss little things like going out for coffee or to the gym though. It makes me feel like will never be the same again.. The seeker feels lonely due to loneliness.	labels:Have to talked about this with friends? They may be feeling the same way. Just talking this out with the may be reassuring..

The supporter would like to find out the reason of the anxiety and fear. The supporter could ask the seeker to think about the most important things in her life.	labels:I am sorry that wasn’t helpful.. Have you tried looking into local recourses in your city?
text:I felt that you were very helpful. It is nice to just know that someone is listening. I do not think that there is much in the way of local resources at the moment - everyone is very stretched.. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should encourage the seeker to focus on the positive things in the world.	labels:That is true it has been hard for many people..
text:I do feel better for having been able to talk to you about this - thank you very much!. I think I will be able to carry on for a bit now. Thanks again and best wishes! The seeker feels stressed out but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details.	labels:I’m glad I could provide you some support.	episode_done:True

The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:What kind of a funk is it? Do you have to go to work or school? Please tell me more about how you are feeling so I can understand better.
text:Nothing seems to be fun and I work from home. The seeker is obviously depressed and needs extra attention. The supporter should ask questions like, "Are you going to bed?" and "is there something you want to talk about?"	labels:Are you doing okay workwise, getting enough done, getting it done on time? Or is it difficult to get motivated about anything? Is there anything that you think started making you feel this way? I am very interested in understanding how you feel.
text:I think this whole Covid thing has been depressing! I get my work done but it is a chore. The seeker feels depressed and unmotivated. The supporter should ask the seeker about the work or school situation.	labels:Do you live alone? Did you work at home before COVID? I worked at home before COVID but with COVID I became very isolated. I don't have any neighbors within sight of my house. This my sound weird but I make up  fantasies in my head like I am an alien's pet and my home is my habitat or I pretend I am hiding out  keeping something safe, or a pioneer woman waiting for her family to get back from the store which is a six  month trip..
text:I live with my spouse, and I did work at home before. Pioneer story funny! It is hard not being able to enjoy going out.. The seeker feels depressed and isolated. The supporter could tell the seeker she has a support system around her, and she can feel relieved. The supporter also tells the seeker she is working hard to take care of herself.	labels:I am glad you are able to work, financial stress really sucks. I think Covid has us all down at least at some point..
text:Just want it to be over and then the election too! There has been so much emotional things in the world going on right now. BLM, election Covid... The seeker feels stressed and the supporter understands why. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.

The supporter could also ask the seeker if she can think of things in her life to cheer her up to help her feel	labels:Yes, and it doesn't seem to have an end in sight. But at some point it will be over. If you don't feel more like yourself say a month from now I have to seeing a doctor because some depression requires it but that said some depression is normal and usually precedes change. I was told that it sort of erases our expectations and allows us to accept the new thing in a better way..
text:I would say when i take a walk at the park it does help. Also working out. So exercise and sunshine brings my mood up a bit. The seeker feels lonely and isolated, and the supporter has some suggestions.	labels:You sound  stressed over things that you have little to no control over. Take a deep breath. Tickle each other. Pretend you are the adam and eve couple traveling to populate a new world and the house is your spaceship run with it and have some adult play time lose yourselves and destress. It is good that you can enjoy the sunshine and the park. You can only control and influence what happens around you. Concentrate on making that a good place to be and that will change the world a little at a time.
text:good advice. I will try. The seeker feels lonely. Also, the supporter should be aware that the seeker feels lonely, and the supporter should be able to support her by understanding the source of her anxiety.	labels:Just hoping to make you feel better and help with some of your worries that don't need to add to your stress. So you don't seem to be depressed as much as stressed and worried which is interfering with things, would that be accurate or could you explain more?
text:Yes, things that I cannot change and the things I can change, including a more positive attitude. The seeker is very stressed but does not mention what is making her stressed.

I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should listen to the seeker and not try to change her feeling. Instead, the supporter should try to support the seeker by asking questions and provide advice.	labels:Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through..
text:Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are. The seeker feels lonely and ashamed. The supporter could talk to the seeker about the situation and see if there is anything the supporter can do to help the seeker.	labels:I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it.
text:What happened out of interest when you had the conversation? The seeker 's girlfriend is a 9 and the seeker is a 5. The supporter should share the idea that it is a good idea to work on your relationship.	labels:Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist. Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more.Since that time, he denies everything.
text:I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends. The seeker feels ashamed of the way she behaves, but the supporter has no idea what is going on. The supporter should ask for more information.	labels:Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER! Curiously, why do you think she's cheating?
text:I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two. The seeker feels lonely and insecure about her relationship. The supporter could tell the seeker that the best thing to do is to just ask and see what she has to say.	labels:Hmm... So have you two live together?  How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?
text:That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way! The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.
text:very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her? The seeker sees that the supporter offers help, but the seeker has a hard time saying no to the supporter. The supporter should remind the seeker that he can say yes, but he won't feel comfortable about it.	labels:Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.
text:not at all. I appreciate your candour. The seeker feels the supporter is a good listener and he could help the seeker to know the truth. So, the supporter could tell the seeker to just talk to her and see what happens.	labels:But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?
text:All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly. The seeker feels a bit sad, but the supporter could provide some advice to help the seeker to feel more comfortable with the situation.	labels:I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you feeling today?.\nHello. I am OK but I have a bot of a work issue that I'd like some support with if possible? The seeker feels lonely and wishes to talk to someone. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the work issue.	labels:Of course! What sort of issue is it?.
text:I have done the same job for 7 years but it is now full and boring. It pays OK but it is all I know. I'm scared that I will get resentful in this job if I stay where I am but I haven't got a clue what to do for the best. The seeker feels there is nothing she can do for the best. She can ask for more information about the issue and also about what the supporter would suggest.	labels:I see, so you feel that your position has become stagnant and you know longer take any pleasure in your work?.
text:That's exactly it yes. The question is I don't have any official qualifications, just experience and I'd like a change of career but this scared me to death! The seeker feels like she is going nowhere and she's scared of the job she's doing and it makes her nervous. The supporter could try to encourage the seeker to see the positive things in her work and her career and to think about what she would like to do.	labels:Are there any opportunities for advancement or retraining in your current position? Perhaps strive for a promotion?.
text:Potentially yes but the position above me is not really like for me and I don't like the reporting line. I think I fancy a change but not quite sure how to tackle it. I need the income so can't just leave but also need to do something about it. do you understand the predicament? The seeker is feeling very lonely and feels she is stuck in her job. The supporter could encourage the seeker to think differently about her situation.	labels:Yes I do. I sympathise with you because it must be terrible to feel that you are stuck in something that you really no longer like and yet be afraid to try and change your situation. I am sure that there is some solution though!.
text:Yeah meet too it's just finding a way where I can maybe stay where I am whilst exploring other opportunities to see what I'd like to do. It's a tough one. The seeker feels lonely and scared of a career in the same thing. The supporter should reassure the seeker that she is not alone and that there are many opportunities that she can explore.	labels:Well, you will never know unless you take the plunge into the unknown! I do realise how difficult it is for you to do that though. Perhaps start putting out feelers to other companies? There is no harm in that..
text:Sue that's actually a good idea. No harm I suppose and my current employer would be none the wiser. The seeker feels lonely and wants to work on a new issue. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:True! it would also be great for your self esteem to realise just how much more there is out there that you could be doing..
text:I know, it is a big world out there and I have been doing the same thing for so long. It is exciting but also quite unnerving. Is this normal? The seeker is worried about the feeling of stagnation in her work. She knows that the supporter has the best solution to her problem. The supporter could give some instructions to the seeker to get more information about the situation and make a well-thought-out decision.	labels:Yes, there is nothing to worry about. Do you have any relevant qualifications that might help you find another job?.
text:I have experience and I am pretty hard-working. I have also made quite a few connections over the past 7 years. The seeker feels excited and relieved. She has told the supporter that she feels comfortable about her current situation.	labels:It all sounds very promising. If you think they'd not tell your boss why don't you talk to some of your connections and see if they can put you onto something better?.
text:Yeah reaching out to my network is probably a good idea - as long as they keep the fact that I am looking for something else quiet. I'd state on Linked in that I'm looking for work but then everyone would know :-) The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter helps the seeker to feel less lonely.	labels:One other suggestion - it's a high risk strategy but do you think your boss might be sympathetic if you discussed this with him or her? You never know, they might even have some good suggestions - perhaps they feel the same!.
text:Actually you might be right there. I should be able to open up about this and they should be supporting my development. Great suggestion. I think I'm overthinking things. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to look at her life and work in a new way and make the changes she needs to make.	labels:No I do not believe that you are overthinking at all.  This is a very important aspect of your life and will shape your future!.
text:Yes true thanks for your understanding. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:You are most welcome - I hope that I have been able to give you some peace of mind.
text:You have indeed, thanks for this conversation. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Please let me know how things go for you in the future - I am sure that in six months time things will be looking a lot brighter!.
text:Will do, thanks again! The seeker is feeling anxious about the situation she is in. The supporter could ask the seeker for more details about her situation, like the details about the job, the salary, the company and so on.	labels:Erm .. cup of coffee?.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon how may I help you today?\nHello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why. The seeker feels depressed and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that her boyfriend does not want to be with her anymore.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?
text:No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter should tell the seeker to take a break from lockdown and work on getting a clearer picture of her situation.	labels:These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?
text:I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse. The seeker feels anxious that something bad will happen. The supporter could ask the seeker more about the reason she feels anxious.	labels:Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?.
text:Since lockdown  haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available? The seeker feels anxious and is concerned about the worsening of her depression. The supporter could ask more detailed questions to help the seeker feel more comfortable.	labels:It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.
text:What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest. The seeker feels lonely, anxious and depressed. The supporter should suggest she talk to a professional and see if they can help her.	labels:Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app..
text:I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays. The seeker feels anxious, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should make sure that the seeker is more anxious about the possibility that she may not see her psychiatrist.	labels:There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.
text:I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues? The seeker is feeling anxious about her mood and the reason behind her mood. The supporter can relate to the seeker and can support her in her plan.	labels:After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it..
text:That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least. The seeker feels anxious about her depression. She is not clear why she is depressed. The supporter should ask the seeker to think about her routine, any changes and what she does to help her feel better.	labels:It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to "that's what its like to be a mom" but it is more than that..
text:I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine. The seeker is feeling lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.
text:Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective. The seeker feels lonely and depressed and has a fear of worsening depression. The supporter could ask the seeker about the things that are making her feel lonely, worried and anxious.	labels:I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. What would you like to discuss today?\nHi my company laid off 10% of the workforce yesterdsy and I'm worried I. I'm next. The seeker feels worried and lonely. However, the supporter shouldn't tell her that she is next. The supporter should ask more questions.	labels:My goodness. I know that's very difficult to handle. Are you feeling anxiety?
text:Yeah, I'm really nervous about what's happening. Based on who they let go, I think I'll be next because of tenure and experience level. The seeker feels anxious and worried. The supporter could help the seeker look at the situation in a positive way. She could say something like,	labels:So would it appear that they are laying off the people who have been there the shortest time first?
text:Well it's a mix of tenure and department. They also furloughed another 10% of the workforce as well so we're 20% smaller now. The seeker feels anxious about her job. The supporter could ask the seeker how the company is reacting to the layoffs. How is the seeker doing today?	labels:I know this is a terrible time to be laid off from your job. Do you feel that you have a contingency plan if you are one of those who is laid off?
text:No and we are in a worse position. My wife was laid off from her job 3 months ago. I'm the only breadwinner right now. The seeker feels anxious and nervous, but she also feels like her family is suffering due to the layoffs. The supporter should talk to the seeker about the situation and let her know it is not unusual for people to feel nervous. She should tell the seeker that she is sure she will find a new job soon and the supporter should listen to the seeker's worries and try to comfort her.	labels:Oh my goodness. Will either of you be able to claim unemployment while you search for new jobs? My brother was recently laid off and he's considering out of state options to hopefully find a job sooner. While that's certainly not an option for everyone, his unemployment is helping to keep his family afloat.
text:Yeah my wife filed and we just started getting it but it's nowhere what she was making of course. But yeah we can at least pay the electric bill and stuff. The seeker is feeling a lot of anxiety and nervous. The supporter is showing concern for the seeker and trying to help.	labels:Ok, well that's one small thing to help. Are you a renter or owner? As there are a few programs available to help with mortgage payments.
text:I'm an owner. What kind of programs? The seeker seems to have anxiety and worry. The supporter should ask the seeker if she's feeling stressed or anxious.	labels:Check on the government page for your state. It's usually your state.gov  an example is Utah.gov. Google it. Most states have aid available but a lot of people just aren't aware of it.
text:oh ok that's a good point. I will definitely go look for it after this discussion. The seeker is feeling frustrated with the layoff and the supporter should support her by reminding her of the government programs for mortgage assistance.	labels:I hope you can find the assistance you need. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss?
text:yeah how can I make more money on the side? it's sort of why I'm here but it is so hard finding anything good. The seeker feels anxious and nervous. The supporter should try to calm the seeker by giving some tips to the seeker.	labels:As there are a lot of people who've lost their jobs the pickins' are quite slim. But being as the holiday season is upon us. I do knwo there are several stores hiring for seasonal help. Also, Amazon is hiring for customer services reps to work from home I've heard.
text:oh cool, that's good to know. Well, I appreciate all your help. I hope you and your family stay safe during the holidays! The seeker is feeling anxious and wants to know what kind of programs are available to help with mortgage payments. The supporter could suggest the seeker look for information on the state's website.	labels:If it's in your area Instacart is also hiring shoppers and delivery drivers. Is that something you might be able to do?	episode_done:True
text:Hi there, how are you doing today?\nHi I am not sure what to say here. I am not doing very well at all. I am feel sad and hopeless all the time, nothing is any fun, nothing makes me feel that I am doing anything good for anyone. The seeker feels sad and hopeless. And the supporter can tell the seeker that the seeker is not doing anything good for anyone.	labels:I am truly sorry you are feeling this way. Those feelings can be overwhelming. Have you tried talking to a professional about this?
text:I don't have any money to pay someone, my boyfriend tells me to quit having a pity party no one is coming to it and to just get over it. His comments and suggestions have not been helpful. My friends have tried to cheer me up but I can tell they are getting frustrated with me and I try to avoid them now. The seeker feels lonely and hopeless. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:There are many therapists out there that work on a sliding scale based on your income. Some even offer free sessions. I would look into that for your local area. It also does not seem like your boyfriend is taking the issue seriously. I will tell you from experience, ignoring the issue is not going to help.
text:I don't mean to put obstacles in the way of your help but I live 25 miles from town and there is no public transportation here and I don't have a car. You have felt like this before? How long did it last? What did you do to get better? The seeker feels sad and hopeless, her boyfriend is not helping her, her friends are frustrated with her and she feels like she has no one to turn to. The supporter should try to get her to see that she is not alone and she has people around her.	labels:It lasts until you deal with it. I talked to someone to help me understand why an dhow i was feeling this way. Dont worry about putting obstacles for me heh im here to help you.. One good thing covid has done for us is create a surge of telemedicine. I know my therapist along with many others are doing it this way now. It may not be as great as being in person but it helps having that ear to listen to you.
text:I think I feel this way because I feel so stuck. I make a little money working remotely but not enough to make any     big changes and the things I do don't ever last like the house is only clean for moments.. You are right, one of my friends who has asthma started getting her meds through an online doctor and I am sure therapists are on line also, she said her doctor is even reasonable and less than her normal office visit that is something I can look into. The seeker is feeling stressed and in need of help. The supporter could ask further questions to probe for more details or let her know that he can send her to a counselor in her area for free.	labels:I can relate to that, spend 8 hours cleaning the place up for my 10 year old to tear it all down in 10 minutes. Jobs are a whole other can of worms as well. May i suggest though that, even though big goals are great to strive for, you set a bunch of smaller goals to complete?
text:What would be an example of a smaller goal? Enjoy your son my kids are grown and gone and it happens faster than you think. The seeker feels sad about being stuck in her rut of small goals. The supporter might suggest the seeker work on completing some of her smaller goals.	labels:Yea just last year they were a baby in my eyes ha. Maybe just even something as apply to 2 new jobs this week. Clean the kitchen on monday. Simple things.
text:I don't really have big goals because they all seem too impossible to be realistic. Your small goals seem big to me. I can barely drag myself to the kitchen must let get motivated enough to clean it. The seeker feels sad, stressed and hopeless. The supporter should encourage the seeker to focus on the fact that she has a supportive friend.	labels:How about starting with just doing the dishes, or wiping down the counter?
text:That would be a simple goal, I could try for that, I think maybe I should make my first goal to find an online therapist with a sliding fee scale. Do you know if there are any kind of directories for online therapists? How long did it take for you to start to feel better after you started to get  help? The seeker feels hopeless and helpless. The supporter should have the seeker look at the good things in her life and help shift her mindset.	labels:Yes i think that would be a great first step. I would try a google search like "Therapists (My Area) Sliding Scale" As for feeling better its different for everyone. I think it even took a couple months to recognize myself as worthy. Once you start feeling better about yourself it kind of snowballs in a good way.
text:Thank you things don't seem quite as hopeless now and I don't feel so alone and misunderstood. You have a nice day and I am going to go do that search now. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter can encourage the seeker to look for a therapist.	labels:Great! I hope for the best for you!	episode_done:True
text:hi how's it going today?\nHello. I just find life very hard. I have not been happy in months. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:i hear you. it has been a hard year. what's been the biggest challenge for you?
text:Going out and getting things done. Shopping is hard especially when stores are picked over.. The seeker feels like she is stuck doing what she doesn't want to do. The supporter suggests what she could try that might get her out in the world and help her feel better.	labels:it is frustrating not being able to get what you want when you want it. are you having a hard time finding the things you need for right now or for in the future?
text:Both. I feel like the future is uncertain. Not just for me but the world. The seeker needs to be listened to. The supporter should ask for more details about the seeker's worry.	labels:it's true, we are not sure what to expect. have you looked for things online?
text:Yes, but I feel like a lot of it is speculation and news just makes people more fearful. The seeker feels uneasy. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has support around her and the supporter will be there for her.	labels:it is like there's a collective panic going on right now. I know for me focusing on the things i CAN control has helped me from spiraling into panic and depression.
text:How do you deal with other people who focus on all the bad things? The seeker is feeling lonely and worried about the future. The supporter could talk about the things that she can control.	labels:the "little black rain cloud" people? LOLI try very hard to be kind and remember that we all are going throgh the same pandemic and for most of us it's our first.
text:Thanks. Do you think things will get better any time soon? The seeker feels uncertain about the future with the pandemic, and is worried about what other people think of her. The supporter should reassure the seeker and let her know she is not alone.	labels:While there is a lot to focus on that is just awful, it has really helped me to look back to the spanish flue of 1918. that pandemic was followed byt he roaring 20s.
text:I know people thinking the country will collapse soon. Hard to deal with them. The seeker is feeling alone and unsure of the future. The supporter should ask the seeker how she is feeling and what she feels she can control.	labels:The doomsday people are always around. remeber they mayans predicted the end of the world in 2012.
text:I have family like that and it is hard to deal with them. Especially during the holidays. The seeker is feeling stressed and anxious and feeling like things are uncertain for the future. The supporter can help the seeker think positive by encouraging a positive mindset.	labels:are you familiar with Mr. Rogers' story about looking for the helpers when things go bad?
text:No but I did love that show as a kid. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. She is afraid about the future because the world is unpredictable and uncertain.	labels:Family is hard! So many strong emotions and opinions that aren't always helpful. anyone in particular for you?
text:My dad and my GF's dad both have their own opinons on things. The seeker makes a comment about her relationship with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that the support is not the best way to help. In this case, the supporter should encourage the seeker to talk about her feelings.	labels:so when disasters happen you dont focus on the bad things but look and you will always find people helping other people.
text:Yes. I also don't feel like the world will decent into madness, but they do not believe it. The seeker is feeling lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:oooh, that's hard. are you living at home with your dad? as a mom, i can tell you that the unknown for your children is scary. often fear and lack of control come out sideways.
text:No but near him and take care of him. The seeker feels lonely, depressed and worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to help her.	labels:that's really nice of you. i'm 800+ miles away from my parents.
text:That is good and bad. I think it is good to talk about though I do feel a little better thank you. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The supporter could suggest that the seeker talk with her father to see how he is feeling about the situation.	labels:if i can suggest something that might help - brene brown, a leadership coach and researcher has a great TED talk about shame and vunerability and a CUTE cartoon animal video on yourtube about empathy.
text:Ok thank you very much. I think this is a good stopping point, so thank you for your help. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason for this is not mentioned. The supporter could tell the seeker to take a break from the news and focus on other things that bring a smile to her face.	labels:those help me focus on how hard it is for everyone around me and that i should be kinder to them. everyone has their own crap.
text:Indeed. it helps to have people to talk to right? The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely. The supporter could try to help the seeker by telling the seeker that she is doing a great job.	labels:true. stay safe.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. How are you feeling today?\nHi, I'm feeling really anxious today. The seeker feels anxious about the upcoming event. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of friends who are around to help her.	labels:What has made you feel anxious?
text:Yesterday my company laid off 10% of the workforce and another 10% got furloughed. I'm afraid I might be in the next round. The seeker feels anxious about the situation. The supporter could tell the seeker that the company has done this in the past, and it is not the end of the world.	labels:I am very sorry to hear that. I am currently in a situation where furloughs are greatly affecting my family as well.
text:Oh no that's terrible. The problem is, I am right now the only breadwinner in the family. My wife was laid off three months ago. The seeker feels like she is the only breadwinner in her family. The supporter could ask the seeker to think if she could have a conversation with her husband.	labels:Are you given specifics on time of furlough?
text:No, it's basically until things get better. The seeker feels anxious about the furlough. The supporter should provide more comforting words and try to help the seeker focus on the positive aspects of her own life.	labels:I know that's very difficult. And no doubt why you're here working for crumbs. It's why I'm here as well.
text:Yeah, trying to make ends meet wherever I can. I've been also trying to do uber as well but everyone is doing it also. The seeker feels anxious and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her and hope she is not the one that is going to be furloughed.	labels:I know it's a difficult time. Yes Uber is definitely overrun right now. Have you taken any time out to address your anxiety so it doesn't become more serious?.
text:I don't know what I can do. I've been trying to keep busy. And I can't afford a therapist or anything like that. The seeker feels very anxious. She also feels the supporter is understanding her situation and is trying to help her. The supporter should ask what it is the seeker wants to do to help herself.	labels:Yes, that's definitely an expense you can't afford right now. But are you familiar with the concept of controlled breathing to help reduce or relieve anxiety?
text:Like meditation? What am I supposed to do? Just breathe in and out a lot? The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could be the one to provide a solution.	labels:Not exactly. Controlled breathing is more of getting yourself into a quiet room. Closing your eyes, and purposely and intently focusing on your breathing. Slowly breathe in for a count of 5, then slowly exhale for a count of 5. Repeat this process for approximately 10 minute. It will help your stress levels and help regulate your heart rate!
text:Oh I didn't know that. No, I haven't tried that. Does it really work? The seeker says she does not know what to do. The supporter could recommend controlled breathing as a place where the seeker can go to relax.	labels:I've been using it myself over the past 3 months and it most definitely helps!

The supporter could tell the seeker there is someone around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one. What kinds of things are troubling to you?

The supporter could tell the seeker about some ways to deal with the situation.	labels:Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant.

Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to.. Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived. The seeker feels alone, stressed, and is experiencing conflict at work. The supporter should ask for more details about the conflict and try to help.	labels:That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.
text:Yea. But when he threatens and calls my insubordinate, I worry he might be making a case to remove me. I wonder if I should talk to the person above him, about it. But I worry they might just think I'm complaining because its different. But it really is uncomfortable. The seeker feels lonely and stressed about being threatened. The supporter could tell the seeker that she should be able to do her job and also be comfortable.	labels:It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you.  Talking to someone above your supervisor may be a good solution. .
text:Its been 3 months since he started, I just wonder if its too soon. I'd hate to be seen as a complainer. And the person above him, is the person who hired him. The seeker feels stressed and frustrated. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details about the situation.	labels:When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.
text:Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people? The seeker feels lonely and stressed about the situation. The supporter should help the seeker feel less lonely and get some positive attention.	labels:I see you really like your job.  Sometimes just taking a deep breath can help to calm stress. .
text:Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress. I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed? The seeker feels stressed, worried about losing her job, and lonely. The supporter could tell her to focus on the things she is grateful for, to build up positive thoughts.	labels:Do you think he'll be receptive to your communications if you speak directly to him?

That's when I got frustrated (helping them with unemployment) The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should try to convince the seeker to think about her loved ones.	labels:Money is not always a big deal honey.

text:I am very upset. The seeker feels upset. The supporter could be able to make the seeker feel safe.	labels:Hello, how are you doing today? Im sorry to hear your upset. Do you want to go into why you are?
text:A friend of more than 20 years hurt me deeply by judging me for not buying a gift for my nephew for his birthday. The seeker is upset because of her friend who judged her. The supporter can listen and support by showing empathy and by reassuring the seeker.	labels:Why would they judge you on that? Do they know your nephew as well?
text:Yes, she is very close friends with my nephew's mother as well. She is the kind of person who will go into deep debt and overdraw her bank account to buy someone a gift, I am not. I could not afford the gift, I am disabled and on a very minimal income. The seeker feels hurt and feels judged by her friend. Even if she can't afford to buy the gift, she is still supposed to buy the gift. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone and people around her also feel the way she does.	labels:That i can relate too, i am also disabled and on SSI. Have you spoken to her about how she upset you?
text:I did. I took a few days to cool off and then told her that her comments hurt me. I know that she's aware of my financial situation as well as the fact that I am disabled. Her response was that she said nothing wrong. The seeker feels hurt and upset. The supporter should help the seeker to express her feelings.	labels:Thats a tough spot to be in with a friendship that has lasted so long. Does she tend to treat you like this regularly?.
text:No, she really never has. Typically, she feels like other people walk all over her and take advantage of her, but that's never been me and its never been our relationship. The seeker is upset because her friend hurt her deeply. The supporter should ask more details about the situation and offer some words of comfort.	labels:Then would you say its a little odd for her to be acting in this manner towards you?
text:Yes, quite. At times over the years she can become quite self absorbed. But she's never been so downright hurtful. I can't really see a way for our relationship to be the same anymore. The seeker is upset about the way she is treated by her friend. The supporter could ask why she thinks she is being treated this way.	labels:I would agree that the relationship is getting a bit toxic but before terminating such a long relationship i would do one thing. I would try to see if there is something going on in her life right now for her to be acting like this. Sometimes people dont know how to talk about something thats bothering then and it in turn comes out as anger or spite.
text:That's true. We've been through a lot together over the years. But I can't deny that what she said hurt, and our conversations are just so superficial now. The seeker feels hurt and betrayed. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is possible to have a healthy friendship even though the relationship is not what it used to be.	labels:Yeah to be honest if you press the issue and ask if anything is going and you continue to get toxic responses. It might be time to end the friendship. I would do that as a last resort but there is no need for you to be carrying it one sided and holding all the burden as well. It hurts to have to end a long friendship but unfortunately sometimes it has to happen to keep yourself in a better spot.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nHello, I'm feeling very anxious about my classes. How are you? The seeker feels anxious about her classes, but the supporter could tell her she is not alone.	labels:I am doing well, I also get really anxious about my classes. They can be really stressful.
text:Yeah, especially with the pandemic, it's just been so hard to try and focus. The seeker feels lonely and concerned about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I agree, there is so much going on that it is hard to stay focused while trying to make sense of all this.
text:Exactly. Do you have any suggestions for what I can do to try and do better in my classes? I've tried talking to my professors, but they've all been really unhelpful thus far. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Of course! I like to wake up a little earlier and at least get started on an assignment to feel like I have accomplished something at least before the rest of the world wakes up. I understand some people like their sleep, so another suggestion is to review any notes you take and use different colored ink for different topics or important highlights.
text:I think that's a really good idea! I usually sleep in too late and then feel like I'm rushing around to get all of my work done, only adding onto the stress. I also really like the pen idea. Do you have any suggestions for good brands that I should use to help make my notes better? The seeker feels lonely and worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could help her feel confident that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Uniball makes really good pens that the option to switch colors on the pen, but they sell packs with different colors too. I like to use red ink for really important things, and blue for things I might think I will need later but aren't sure.
text:I think that's a really good idea for helping to improve my focus. If my notes are more eye-catching, it'll help to keep my attention when I'm looking over them again after class and trying to study. I think your suggestion of waking up earlier is good too, what time do you suggest waking up in the morning? I usually don't set an alarm and find myself rushing around before class. The seeker feels lonely, anxious and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the fact that there are people around her who care about her and want to help.	labels:I personally wake up around 6AM and have just gotten used to it so I wake up that time no matter what. I blame the army.  But, an alarm on your phone or computer can be effective. Even having someone you know that wakes up early call you can be a help, provided you are not grumpy at being woke up :)
text:I think that would really help. I sometimes have trouble waking up to my alarms in the morning too, but maybe making the ringtone louder would help with that as well or putting it further away from me so that I have to get up further in the morning to get it. Do you think those would be effective too? Or would getting a different alarm help? The seeker feels lonely, and the supporter tries to help her by suggesting things to do and to focus on.	labels:That is a really good idea actually!! I should try that and put my phone on the other side of the room next time I want to wake up earlier. I personally use the most annoying thing I can find as a ringtone/alarm, so that I will make every effort to turn it off but a lot of the alarm clocks you can find in stores are plenty loud and annoying.
text:Ooh, yeah. I like your ringtone idea too! I usually make it some sort of song that I like and then end up either sleeping past it or not hearing, but I think making it something loud or annoying would really help to get me up to turn it off. The seeker feels lonely and finds herself anxious. The supporter could suggest to the seeker that she can change her mindset and focus on the things she has rather than the things she doesn't have.	labels:What exactly do you think causes you to have to rush around before class? Just not enough time or just situations you cannot control. Trust me I understand myself, I have been in college 2.5 years myself. and it took about 1.5 years to get to where I was comfortable with my schedule and personal time.
text:I think knowing that I don't have to drive to campus is what makes me feel like I can sleep in. It feels much easier to just wake up and go onto my computer than having to get ready in the morning and drive to campus. I think I mostly miss that routine. Because of that, I also find myself going to bed much later than I should be, even on school nights. The seeker feels more comfortable due to the supporter's suggestions.	labels:That is a good rational reason I would say, I do online classes too and it is far too easy just to wake up, go to the computer and that is it for the day. Campus life seems more structured and like you could plan a routine, but being stuck at home sort of changes all of that.
text:Exactly. It was much easier for me when I had a routine schedule, versus knowing that I can just wake up, roll out of bed, and go to class, but I think that your suggestions are really going to help me finish my semester on a better foot. The seeker feels worried and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I am really glad I can help, I think part of me was talking to myself as well when giving advice since I have gotten alot lazier these days. I hope you have a great day and hang in there and stay focused and you will do great!!!!!	episode_done:True

The supporter could tell the seeker that she is a good person and deserves to be loved.	labels:Can i know the reason why you got attracted to her mom when she herself is there ?

text:i have gone to her home.her mom taken advantage to me what should i dothat time so we did it. The seeker s shame and she was attracted to another woman.

text:but till now my girlfriend dont know about it but her mom is now targeting me for her sexual desire. The seeker guilty, but the supporter should focus on the seeker's current emotion without judging her. The supporter should help her to forget what happened.	labels:You have got such a nice girlfriend, have a happy life with her.
text:but think about her mom how could i handle her. The seeker shame and her girlfriend will feel hurt. The supporter should know that her girlfriend is not ready for a physical relationship, but the supporter should also let her know that the supporter will support her if she wants to. The supporter should let her know that, the supporter will be there for her in the future as a friend.	labels:Dont worry, just tell your girlfriend directly about the incident of how her mom is behaving towards you with a proof if you could. Or else be bold enough to warn her mom regarding this.
text:yes im going to warn her. The seeker shame and angry but the supporter could help her to understand the incident and help her out. The supporter should be supportive.	labels:You have such a nice girlfriend my dear friend, so cheating her is not at all fair. Yes, go ahead, the problems will vanish.
text:yeah i can understand. The seeker shy one and the supporter is a open-minded one. Both are feeling happy at the end of this conversation.	labels:And i believe you too are good, as you have realised your mistake , so stop worrying or feeling guilty for the act. Be happy :)
text:sure i will try to solve my problem. The seeker guilty. She has not told the supporter about the real reason behind her cheating. The supporter could have told the seeker that her girlfriend is not aware of the incident and there is no point of telling her directly.	labels:Thats the spirit :)
text:give any tips to warn her my friend. The seeker guilt and shame for her action. The supporter would tell the seeker to trust her and to be happy with her girlfriend.	labels:Just be bold enough, dont get aroused or attracted to her by any way even though she's seducing you, be harsh towards her , because you will have to teach a better lesson to her. Tell her, if she repeats this , then you are either gonna tell it to your girlfriend or either file a complaint against her.
text:yyeah sure my friend i will try this. The seeker ame and guilt, but the supporter shows understanding and concern for the seeker.	labels:Yess. Go ahead.	episode_done:True
text:I am worried about being perfect on my job.  I don't want to lose my job. The seeker feels stressed and worried about her job performance, and she needs help to cope with that. The supporter should be able to address the seeker's worries.	labels:I hear you are trying to be perfect on your job because you are worried about losing your job.  How long have you been at your job?
text:I have been working for about 4 months, but I just am not as fast at it as everyone else.  I'm trying so hard working late and everything but it's never enough. The seeker feels worried about her job. The supporter could tell the seeker to learn how to be perfect at work.	labels:That can be hard when you are working so hard to try to do your best.  Can you consult with a supervisor or co-workers to get some help?
text:Maybe I could ask my friend and co-worker for some tips.  I'm a little embarrassed to do so, but don't know where to turn. I don't want to get fired. The seeker feels embarrassed to talk to her co-worker about her problem. The supporter could ask the seeker questions to help with the situation.	labels:Asking for help isn't always a bad thing.  I asked for help at my last job and they gave me someone to help out.  I was so relieved.
text:That's true maybe it could turn out for the better.  But what if they see me as incompetant? The seeker feels embarrassed and helpless because she's worried about losing her job. The supporter can tell the seeker that she is not incompetent and the supporter is there to help.	labels:I can see that you have worry of being seen incompetent but as long as you are doing your best, they have to see the efforts you are making as positive.
text:That's a good way to put it. The seeker feels lonely and is worried about losing her job. The supporter could ask the seeker to think of things that make her feel loved and happy.	labels:Sometimes deep breaths can help keep you calm when approaching others in an anxiety provoking situation.
text:I will have to try that.  That might help. The seeker feels anxious. The supporter could ask the seeker what they are anxious about. The supporter could also ask what the seeker is confident about.	labels:Have you thought of doing additional work related trainings?  Sometimes they can give suggestions to improve work abilities.

She is also worried that her work won't be supportive. The supporter should ask questions and give some suggestions to help the seeker.	labels:You could ask your immediate supervisor or sometimes Human resources for support.
text:I can do that.  I think I'll reach out tomorrow to Human Resources for some help. The seeker feels lonely and worried, but the supporter can tell the seeker that she has support from her friend and co-worker.	labels:That sounds like a good plan to reach out for support.  Is there anything else I can help with?

The supporter could suggest to the seeker to focus on what makes her happy and to feel loved. 	labels:I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self-esteem is that true?

I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination. The seeker feels depressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.
text:I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable. The seeker has low self-esteem. She is sad about the break-up and that she has lost interest in everything. The supporter could discuss the fact that she has a right to be sad.	labels:have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.
text:I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't  ever want to feel like this again. The seeker feels lonely and depressed.

The supporter could tell the seeker to think about what she really wants and maybe talk about it with a friend.	labels:yes it's really good to talk it through with someone first just really understand if trying to restart your old relationship is the right thing to do for you.
text:I think I conversation has actually helped me understand my motivations a little better. you have also given me some good suggestions so thank you for that. The seeker finds out that she has made a mistake by ending things with her partner. The supporter could help the seeker by reminding her that she's a caring person and will do the right thing and make sure she's happy.	labels:I'm happy to hear that. you seem like a really decent person and I'm sure you will make the right decision and I'm positive you can get past this!
text:Thanks for the conversation. It really helped. The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely. The supporter could help the seeker feel better and help her get through this tough time.	labels:You are very welcome.	episode_done:True
text:Hello how are you doing today? I'd love to chat with  you! What's been on  your mind?\noh hello. I'm having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don't have any. The seeker feels lonely and stressed, because she feels there are no friends.  The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to friends about her feelings and make her feel better.	labels:Oh I see. You feel as though you don't have any friend's currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now.
text:Well it's more that I think I've never had friends. Not anyone I can confide in or laugh with. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that he is right there and that it is ok to be lonely.	labels:That's a really hard thing to be going through. I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any really close family members that you are able to confide in?
text:I don't think I'd want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest. The seeker feels lonely and isolated.  The supporter could focus on the seeker's hobbies, interests and skills.	labels:Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?
text:I've never heard of friendship apps to be honest. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seekers that there is a friend nearby.	labels:Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with. But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now. You don't want family to know about how sad you are. Do you think it's more than just feeling like you don't have any friends?
text:I'd really like someone local though, someone who I could meet up with face to face and who knew my town. The seeker feels lonely, sad and stressed. She feels the need to meet up with someone face to face. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk to her family, or a friend as soon as possible.	labels:On most of the apps, it connects you with people in your town! people close by.
text:I don't know if it's more than that. What do you mean? The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people. The seeker feels sad, stressed and lonely. The supporter should get to know more about the seeker.	labels:Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends! And if that is what you are struggling with, then I think the apps would be a really good first step for you! You can create those bonds and connections with people close by to you on there first, and then when you feel comfortable enough with them you can meet up. That way it's less awkward to hangout with someone you don't really know.
text:oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person? The seeker feels lonely because she doesn't have any friends. The supporter could tell the seeker the she has people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps. You can get comfortable with them before you hangout :)
text:That's so cool. Thanks for your help. The seeker feels lonely and has a hard time finding friends. The supporter should help the seeker by giving her some conversation instructions.	labels:Yeah of course! I hope this helps you, and I wish you the best during these weird times :)	episode_done:True
text:hello how are you?\nI don't know how to get over this. I'm just alright. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter does not ask anything. The supporter should look for the reason causing this emotion.	labels:You are having some trouble getting over something is that correct?. Why are you feeling just alright?.
text:I'm feeling just alright because nothing excites me or gives me joy anymore. Many of my family have passed on and the holidays are coming.. The seeker feels she has lost the joy and excitement of the holidays. The supporter could tell the seeker that she does have many people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I understand that it is hard to have some type of joy especially with the holidays coming along especially when family has passed on..
text:This pandemic doesn't help either. No gatherings with many people.. The seeker feels lonely and sad having no joy in her life. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her that will be happy to see her and be joyful to make her feel loved.	labels:I know it is hard, it also has taken a toll on me as well this pandemic is hard to go through, but I take it day by day. Maybe you should take to someone if there is anyone close to you?
text:Only my Aunt, but I haven't talked to her in a long time. I just figure she's busy.. The seeker feels lonely, worried and seems to be anxious. The supporter could tell the seeker she has someone to talk to and someone who can comfort and encourage her.	labels:maybe you should try to call her sometime im sure she would like that.
text:How do I get over feeling like I'm dumping on her? I know she's family but i'm sure she has problems too. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter tells the seeker there is someone to call. The supporter could also ask questions to help the seeker think of happy memories of her aunt.	labels:right I see where you are coming from, remeber she is your family.
text:Yes, I suppose you are right. My aunt is the youngest sister of my mom. We used to see each other at family gatherings. Maybe she won't mind me calling.. The seeker is feeling lonely, she has no family and no one to talk to. The supporter should try to make the seeker feel that he has a place to go to.	labels:see you got this, a call is all that it takes to feel better.
text:I'm going to follow your suggestion and get myself out of this slump I'm in. I know I'm not the only person who goes through this, but it feels this way sometimes. The seeker feels lonely and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her, and she should know that.	labels:I used to feel like that all the time but then I thought to myself that i needed to surround myself with people and not be alone. Im glad that you are going to follow my suggestion, we all go through the same thing but your getting help and thats whats counts.
text:You have a good point there. I used to think if I had my family then I didn't need anybody else. But we all need somebody to talk to. The seeker feels lonely, and she is in a slump. The supporter could tell the seeker to call her aunt.	labels:exactly you got it, we all need to surround ourselves with good people, im glad that you realize this. I hope that my insight has given you motavation to pursue relationships.
text:Thanks for your help. I'll go now and get my thoughts together to call my aunt. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned.

This are some tough times. Have you all been following protocol after finding out?
text:yes, he's been isolating. but i'm worried that we all with have to quarantine if he's positive. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask if she is okay.	labels:That is stressful to think about but would be a necessity. The only thing you all can do if it comes down to it is try to set it up so you all can be as comfortable as possible during the period.
text:That's true. everything just feels so out of control. The seeker is worried about having to quarantine her family if he is positive. The supporter should let her know she is not the only person in this situation. The supporter can also give her some tips on how to cope with stress.	labels:When i feel like everything is out of control, i try to focus on small tasks that i can complete with ease. Maybe you can focus on setting up quarantine room, or getting medication and food to last for those weeks just in case. Worst case out of that is that you have some extra food and medicine..
text:i can focus on the things i can control - that's good advice. what have you been doing to stay sane through all of this? The seeker is concerned about her family getting covid and her youngest son being tested. The supporter should not make any comment about the test results.	labels:Well for one my house has never been so spotless ha. I have been exercising more, going for more walks with my dog, having more family nights, just anything really that can take my mind of it.
text:i haven't felt like doing much of anything, my house is wreck. where are you finding motivation. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter should help the seeker to be more positive and focus on the things that she can control in order to cope with the stress.	labels:I did not want to let my fears control me. Believe me the first month or so i did just that. I just wanted to feel better. I started small, cleaning one room at a time. Making a small list to get done. Sooner than later the lists got longer, the place got cleaner.
text:did you find a list online or make it yourself? The seeker is stressed from the covid situation. The supporter should encourage the seeker to have a positive attitude.	labels:I made one starting with the easiest jobs first.
text:what should i do when i finish cleaning? The seeker feels stressed but the supporter does not mention the reason for the stress. The supporter can suggest other ways to cope.	labels:Have you ever wanted to try a new hobby? Knitting, woodworking, anything really?
text:good idea, i am just finding it hard to get away from the constant bad covid news. i feel like i'm always on high alert. it's stressing me out. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter can tell the seeker that there are people around her to help.	labels:I was checking 10 times a day. What really helped me was to actually stop checking. Maybe just try to get some local news but dont let it consume you.
text:cleaning, hobbies, anything else good for distraction? got a good podcast recommendation? The seeker is stressed over covid. The supporter tells the seeker to focus on the small tasks she can do.	labels:Ha not at the moment no. I think also trying to include the family in those things as well really helps. I mean if things get heated always good to give everyone space. Well i do love last house on the left, but that is a little dark and i think were trying to steer away from that.
text:thanks for your advice. y'all stay safe. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell her to go to a local gym or to the library to get away from the news.	labels:I hope you do too and i hope the results come out in your favor! If not stay strong and prepared!	episode_done:True
text:Hi. I am Mike. Live in central Kansas and have been very depressed. The seeker feels lonely and has been feeling lonely for a long time.

text:I lost my job due to Covid and they have shut down for good. no jobs around here and no vehicle so i feel hopeless and hate my living situation. just before covid hit i was saving to move...but then job closed. The seeker is feeling hopeless and depressed about her situation. The supporter should ask the seeker to tell more details about her current situation.	labels:Yes that is a very tough situation, Covid has real placed a large amount of stress through out the world. There may be a ray of hope however with a possible vaccine in the near future, maybe this will be back to normal soon and new jobs will become available..
text:I hope so and that is what i know mentally. but emotionally it is hard. i just hate having no job, being at home, no money, no vehicle, and a very bad idea to date since there is a high contagious pandemic. The seeker feels hopeless and despondent.	labels:I understand and you are right it is a a lot of mental stress. Have you reached out to claim unemployment or go to a food pantry? During this pandemic you should not feel shameful to take advantage of these services, there are alot of people who have to ask for help for the first time in their lives..
text:I did not make enough to get unemployment they said. I have not tried a food pantry but that is a great idea. what makes this difficult is I am in a very small town . like we dont wal marts or McDonalds or anything like that. Whole town closes at 9. the closest actual  city is 45 miles away. The seeker is feeling hopeless and depressed. The supporter should work towards making the seeker feel happier and more hopeful. The supporter should tell the seeker the there are people around him that could help. The supporter should also tell the seeker that there is a vaccine that could help in the future... The supporter should also say that there are some things the seeker should do to help himself and make himself feel more hopeful.	labels:Well please try the food pantry and see what they have to offer. Is there anyone whom you could ask for a ride in the future when they go to the bigger city?.
text:I will try food pantry. my sister goes to the city once a month , we shop for the month and i stay with my siter. The seeker feels lonely, stressed, and depressed. The supporter could suggest ways to lift the seeker's mood (food pantry).	labels:Well its seem that you now have a plan try it out see how it works, hopefully this will get back to normal sooner than later and life may go back to somewhat normal and your stress level and mental exhaustion will also subside. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?
text:Well I have been wanting a relationship. and i normally dont feel that way at all. and past week i think how much i kind of should have a family as I am 37 but not sure if i truly want that or i just miss human contact as i have only been around family and not gone out at all except to walk and go to store in town, and am confused if it is actully me wanting somone in my life or just a physical thing. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I think your exactly right, human contact is now a premium and I'm sure you miss that contact that we were once so use to. Missing the contact makes you realize how much you enjoy the company of others. Take it slow and once the vaccine is out ease your way back into the dating scene and see if a relationship is what you really wanted after all.
text:yeah i mean emotionally i want to go maybe try a date or two or even just an adult night out but know logically it is a VERY risky idea. And that I need to not do anything like that till next year at the minimum . I do appreciate the advice and ideas. The seeker feels lonely, stressed and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has some friends to talk to, and the supporter could suggest some suggestions for the seeker to stay busy.	labels:Remember that age is only a number and love will no no number, we are hear to listen and support you so if you ever need to talk just know we are a mouse click away.

text:You as well. The seeker feels anxious, lonely, and stressed. The supporter should mention the reason causing for the seeker to feel this way.	labels:Thank you.
text:Oh I did want to ask. do you have any experience in either Alaska or Arizona? I know vastly differnt places but when I move I had been considering those. among others. Alska seems so risky but potentially amazing but it is rather far away from "main america" The seeker nts to live in one of those states. But the supporter should not let the seeker go to Alaska or Arizona.	labels:I do not have any personal experience and yes they do sound amazing..	episode_done:True
text:hi! how are you doing today>\nHello, I'm doing okay, wbu? The seeker feels lonely and the supporter could tell her how lonely she is.

The way they talk around each other makes me nervous. The seeker feels lonely and confused. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:hmm, tell me more. what do you think is going on?
text:I'm scared when it is just the two of them here at home. And they are jsut so much more friendly together than before we moved in. The seeker has a strong feeling that something is going on. The supporter could encourage the seeker to talk more with her boyfriend about her concerns.	labels:living together can make people more comfortable with each other. has there been something specific that has caused you to wonder about them>
text:Not really specifics. It's more of a just in general sort of thing. I know them both really really well, so I am just picking up on tiny little details. The seeker is scared to be living with her boyfriend and his girlfriend. The supporter should ask questions to make the seeker feel comfortable.	labels:i hear you. have you said anything to either one of them?
text:I have talked to my boyfriend, but he just tells me that it's crazy I would think something like that. Idk... I don't want to sound crazy and blow it out of proportion if it's really nothing. I don't know if there is actually something I should be worried about, or if I am thinking these crazy thoughts for other reasons. The seeker feels her boyfriend and bestfriend are doing something skethy behind her back. The supporter should tell the seeker there is nothing to worry about.	labels:having doubts about relationships is rough. do you know brene brown?
text:I don't know who that is. The seeker is feeling stressed by the news about Nashville. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to give her comfort.	labels:she researches shame and vunerability.
text:Does she do live talks or videos? Or is she more in online writing. The seeker has some fears about her boyfriend and her best friend. The supporter should reassure the seeker that their concerns are not crazy. They should also encourage the seeker to share her concerns with her boyfriend and her best friend.	labels:she has a great TED talk!.

The seeker is feeling worried, and the supporter could tell her that she is not alone and that there is a good reason for her feeling that way. 	labels:that's wise. theres a great youtube video with cartoon animals where brene talks about empathy.
text:Ohhh wait I think I have seen that one haha. It was shown in my class in like 9th grade. The seeker has doubts about the relationship and is afraid to tell the supporter about the doubts. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is feeling and thinking about things that are normal and that this is not a problem.	labels:things are weird for everyone right now. emotions are running high, covid is running rampant, it's a mess and understandable that we are all stressed.
text:Yeah you are right. I think I am just overthinking a lot. I will look into that TED talk. Thank you so much for the advice! I appreciate the conversation. The seeker is worried about being lonely and having doubts in her relationship. The supporter should ask the seeker what has been bothering her.

text:Hello. How are you?\nHi, I'm coping with losing my boyfriend to another woman and can't deal. The seeker feels so lonely and worried, but she does not tell the supporter the reason.

text:I just don't know where to find someone. The seeker is lonely and want to move on with her life. The supporter could tell the seeker to think about all the wonderful things in her life. 	labels:Dont go looking for someone . Let them find you. Just live your life and love will find you.

The supporter could tell the seeker that it is alright to feel that way.	labels:Have you thought at all about looking for a new job that might not be so stressful? .

The seeker feels lonely and uncertain about the job situation. The supporter could point out that it is hard to be proactive and communicate with your boss directly.	labels:Is there anyone you can contact who has been in a similar situation to help you?
text:i wish there was someone like that.  i've talked to people in the past about this type of situation but i wasn't the one under the gun.  but your advice is good and i'll try and think of someone who might be able to help me. . The seeker s a radio announcer and she is looking for a job that is less stressful. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is doing a great job.	labels:That's great that you are so willing to try different options to move forward.  Perhaps a family member may help?
text:i haven't told the specifics of this mess to my parents; i dont want to burden them with this.  they worry about me enough as it is.  my sisters wouldn't be able to help me.  they both have seirous emotional issues and are both in very bad marriages and have plenty of their own problems. . The seeker feels lonely and worried about losing her job. The supporter should suggest the seeker to ask for some help from her family.	labels:Just from chatting with you, I can see why you are anxious.  Have you tried any deep breathing techniques.  They are often helpful when dealing with stress.
text:that's a good idea.  i think i'll try that. and praying. The seeker feeling worried and anxious about being fired from her job.

The seeker feels anxious and worried. The supporter should show empathy and concern for the seeker.	labels:My grandmother always encouraged me by saying there is always someone who has it rougher.

How are you coping with it?
text:well I'm not really, especially as she'd gone off with someone else. But I'm to blame which makes it worse. The seeker feels sad and lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:You do seem upset so that shows that you care! Do you mind me asking what happened?
text:I cheated on her on a drunken night. It was a one-off and I regret it terribly. But she found out about it and left me without giving me a chance to explain. The seeker feels upset.

It must be difficult for you though because she didn't give you another chance.. Do you have someone to talk to about your feelings?
text:yeah, I'm not saying I deserved it just wish she had. But no, not really. No-one who would understand. The seeker has to deal with the break up. She finds herself upset and does not have someone to talk to. She could be more understanding.	labels:I would have wanted a second chance too if I were in your shoes.. Is this affecting you really bad?
text:Yeah I feel so low. The seeker can be shown to be lonely and desperate. The supporter can encourage the seeker to change her mindset by suggesting that she change her focus from what she wants to what she has instead of letting herself feel down and sad.	labels:If your mood is affecting your daily activities, normally that means your mental health has been affected.. You could always talk to a professional if it's hard for you..
text:it's difficult though, to open up. The seeker does not feel lonely, but she still feels depressed. The supporter should encourage the seeker to get help.	labels:It is. But trust me, it really helps. I've been seeing a therapist recently actually and I love it. I don't have to worry about judgement at all.. It's a hard step but worth it in the end..
text:They won't think I'm to blame? The seeker feels lonely and is frustrated because she has no one to talk to about her personal issues. The supporter could also ask if she would mind sharing her feelings with her friends.	labels:The job of the therapist isn't to figure out if what you did was wrong or right. It's to help you understand your feelings and better cope. That's why they are so great!
text:oh yeah, that's a good point. The seeker feels lonely and depressed, but the supporter is encouraging her to talk to a professional.	labels:Would you like to talk anything else through?

I can understand being discouraged to and not knowing who will understand you..

The seeker doesn't feel lonely, but the supporter should continue to encourage the seeker and help him to take care of himself.	labels:So to recap, find a good friend, get exercise, eat well, talk to people who will try to understand you.  And of course, pray.  The survival rate is 99.996% so the fact that you know no one who died is good news. I had flu like symptoms before this all happened and I still have a cough. They spray the skies too, so I try to not live in fear. There are a lot of consequences to fear, your heart beats faster, you stress yourself out, so it's important to not focus on negativity for too long.

She could encourage the seeker to eat well, get exercise, and talk to people who can help her.	labels:Here is a good saying -- if you want to change your feelings, change your thinking.

The supporter could understand the reasons of the seeker's feeling and give some conversation tips to help cheer the seeker up.	labels:I'm almost 60 and my husband is 66. We refuse to live in fear. These are difficult times, no doubt, but I believe if you take the time to pursue good healthy, you will be better for it, emotionally and mentally and physically. All around! Well, I hope I have encouraged you..
text:Yes, I think walking, changing my thoughts, praying, and taking care of myself will really help. Yes! You've really helped me out. I just turned 64 and my husband is 69. He is really, really healthy because he takes care of himself so well.. He has a handicapped younger sister and he always wanted to be around to take care of her. So he has always taken care of himself! Thanks so much! The seeker and the supporter discuss the fact that the supporter has a friend who has had the coronavirus. The supporter explains to the seeker that the survivor has a cough but is not feeling sick.	labels:So we are about the same age then!

The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to spend less time preparing and more time practicing her answers.	labels:Is it possible that you could get a friend or family member to work with you on your responses?

The seeker feels anxious because she needs to prepare for an interview.

The supporter could also ask the seeker to find out if she is getting some support from family and friends.	labels:Yes, I have had to deal with time pressures quite a few times. I am sure most people have in the modern era where everything moves so fast. I have usually gotten help from friends, or done my best to delay or remove other commitments from my life. As a last resort, I have sometimes had to accept that I would be getting less sleep than usual for a few days.. Are there any other commitments that you can possibly delay or remove from your life while you prepare for your job interview?
text:Perhaps I can ask if I can finish early from work for the next couple of days and get some time that way. I do think however I'll be more nervous due to less time to prepare. The thing is I'd delay the interview but this might affect my chances. I suppose I could ask my partner to look after the childcare for the next couple of days. The seeker feels stressed and worried about her interview. The supporter could help the seeker with some practical suggestions and how she may be able to manage her interview.	labels:That seems like a good idea, unless that will be likely to cause you other problems.

You can decide that while you would like to get this new job, the world will not end if you don't get it, and you will worry less and have less stress. Also there is the classic technique of picturing your interviewer in their underwear. It makes them seem less imposing, and you can feel more confident. Do you think any of these ideas might help?
text:There are actually some great suggestions there. The naked idea is a classic and it did make me smile. I think I am aiming for perfection when I think I should try and relax and just give it my best shot. That does help actually! The seeker felt stressed and nervous. The supporter gave some simple conversation instructions and the seeker was able to relax.	labels:Be confident in your abilities.

What's going on.
text:Oh no, I hate driving in the snow. Spun out one year- rather not drive in snow- at least when it's icy. My interest rate hit another credit card. Have to pay $80 more a month now. Hoping to find more work so I can pay it off faster. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should ask for more details about the problem.	labels:Ah, so if I understand you correctly, your interest rate has increased, so you need to find another job to pay it off?
text:yeah cuz it was a no interest rate card and that expired so it started charging interest. I knew it was coming but need to work more hours now. The interest I pay every month will go down as I pay more of the principal off. I just hate it. The seeker has no interest in talking to the supporter. The supporter should try to find out what is the real reason for her stress.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Are you feeling stressed out about it?
text:Yes and no. Cuz I know I will pay it off within 3 years at the most. Probably closer to two years. I just don't like to wait and want to pay it off sooner if possible. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I understand exactly how you feel. When I finished school, I wanted to pay off my student loans as soon as possible. I'm glad to hear that you are not too stressed about it though.
text:Yeah it's easier said than done. Btw I heard Biden might forgive student loans! Yay! Yeah cuz it bought a lot of items I needed so I'm happy I got them.

Luckily, I paid all of my debts already but I think it will be great for other people. Perhaps if you are unable to find another job to reduce the principal, you could try setting aside a certain amount of money each month to put towards the amount owed?
text:maybe they will reimburse you on what you paid. I could if i really discipline myself to. The seeker feels stressed but the supporter could understand her reasoning for wanting to pay off her debt as soon as possible.	labels:It's just a thought. Alternatively, I'm not sure if you typically get money for birthdays and the winter holidays, but you could commit some of that amount towards your principal amount.
text:I get some but I spend the money on myself- like chocolate! itll prob take me 2-3 years to pay it off. if i go too much into discrectionary money i feel deprived. The seeker feels stressed, unhappy, lonely, and worried. The supporter should help the seeker get a positive and realistic perspective on the situation.	labels:I understand that also. There needs to be some sort of balance. However, it sounds like you are a smart person and will make sure to pay off the amount responsibly. Everything will be okay!

The seeker is scared because her friend is doing drugs. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay for her to feel scared and that having a friend who is a stranger is scary.	labels:so your plan is to keep your distance, your friend will eventually see him for who he is.
text:How do I deal with the sadness of all this? The seeker feels sad because her friend is not a good person and she is angry and feel betrayed.	labels:I would suggest joining  a group like Al-Anon.  It will be goof for you to talk to others in this situation.
text:Maybe so. I know I talk to family about it and they don't think it's that big of a deal. The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could invite the seeker to join a support group.	labels:It is difficult for others to understand unless they are in the situation. .
text:Yes, I guess it is not easy for them to understand. But she's been my friend for so many years, I just don't get it. What was that group Al-Anon? The seeker s feeling sad, confused and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker she will be in a better situation after the holidays is over.	labels:I mean Non-Anon  -it is a 12 step program for loved ones of addicts. Is there anything else I can help you with?
text:I'll have to look into it.. The seeker s feeling sad and confused. It is not clear that the supporter understands that the seeker is not ready to let go. The supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to be careful with this choice because she does not want to be hurt.	labels:okay.

text:Hello. The seeker is not feeling lonely, but the supporter should know there are others around the seeker to help her.	labels:Hey, how are you today?
text:I am well, thanks for asking. I am doing some studying and taking a break now. Just to talk about some of the feelings, thoughts, and stresses. The big thing on my mind now is the pandemic.

text:There's kind of a lag as I am on the East Coast. So the cases didn't really show up for the second wave until this month, only sporadically last month. But we were doing now until about two to three weeks ago. well fear, anxiety. worries, and also anger that people are being foolish and complacent, especially the youth groups that go to gyms and restaurants a lot, or to gatherings. even in my apartment people on my floor walk back and forth frequently to go out, for what, I don't know and it just boggles on my mind. The seeker is feeling fear, anxiety, and anger. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on what she can control and not worry about the rest. If the supporter is feeling any of these emotions, they could ask for help on how to manage their emotions.	labels:Yes I understand, I'm from the east coast and I'm deeply concern about the raising cases and the lockdown..
text:I get that there's a fatigue but I was there and I had that fatigue and I got over that a few months ago late summer when I tried to reason myself that it was safe to go out when there weren't any cases then, as the first wave was gone from my city. I see. Yeah I feel you definitely. like people are becoming impatient but this is not the right time to be. If I can overcome that initial impatience, others should also. If they have no right reason to be out except for work and personal business, then I don't think they should be doing that too much. The seeker is feeling fear, anxiety, and anger about the pandemic. When the supporter ask about the second wave, the seeker mentions the fatigue. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is important to be patient and calm.	labels:I think those who are aware of the situation should follow the rules and be aware. We really can't change the situation because it human nature..
text:it is. And that's sad but true. It's in our nature, as you say. It's in our nature to destroy and to consume, etc. unfortunate but I can only cope by doing what I feel is right, and continue to do so. and not compromise my values along with others. The seeker feels lonely, worried, anger and fatigue. The supporter can tell the seeker to focus on her studies and work.	labels:However, we shouldn't let it affect us physically, spiritually and most importantly mentally. We need stay relax and be aware of whats going on and believe that by following the rules we are doing our part in reducing the speard.
text:yes I agree also. It's hard though and it was getting to me even more middle of this year. I was more affected and more emotional. So I do see that I am getting used to it, though how long is uncertain, as the cases rise again. So hopefully I can stay well mentally. The seeker feels lonely, anxious, worried and angry. The supporter should ask the seeker to focus on what she can control like the physical state of her body and her mental state.	labels:Every night, I give myself an hour to unwind and relax. Things like, enjoying a movie, snack, drink or even favorite candle helps a lot.
text:and yeah, that's the best we can do for now, as you say, is follow the rules and science, and do our part. ignore the naysayers and compromisers. that's really good. the relaxation technique, I mean. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Exactly, keep calm and relax. Avoid any negative vibes. Aim is to distress yourself..
text:yeah I take time every now and then off from my studies, but my schedules are not set or consistent, and I procrastinate a lot. So that when I fall behind on a typical day, I try to catch up and end up not having enough time to even work out at home, or feel tired and sleepy, when I should have finished with my academic work early in the day. yeah that's good advice. I will keep trying to tune out and filter the negativity and daily news. The seeker feels stressed, and the supporter is trying to calm the seeker down. The supporter also gives some advice on how to relax and to use a candle.

text:so yeah, just aimless and procrastinate often, and need more self-imposed structure, discipline, maturity, organization, time-management, etc. yeah good idea. like I am only lately gaining ground and staying on track so I am improving on this. yeah I should be like that too, something like having an hour to look forward to towards the end as a reward of some sort.

I think you have provided some very valuable advice. And I will keep those in my mind on a daily basis. The seeker feels stressed and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend.

text:Yes, I'm trying my best. The seeker feels lonely and is worried about how to connect with friends. The supporter could share how to connect with others without physically being there.	labels:Do you think your friends would like a card?

I would see if there is anything you can do to help, if not just try and be as supportive as you can.
text:Ok, that sounds like a good plan. I'm just a little worried that it won't work because she was acting really rude. So I feel like I don't really want to talk to her right now. The seeker is angry because she is talking to her friend and the friend was not listening. The supporter could suggest the seeker tell her friend that she is in a bad mood and try to leave her alone.	labels:Well, youre own health and well being does come first.

text:I just want to connect and please my friends but it is hard to not have any physical contact and only be online. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her boyfriend.

text:ugh, yeah... I drive a really old beat up car though, so I can't really go out after dark, and I'm worried I'm driving it too much and it's going to break down. I wish mturk paid more, or one of the jobs I've applied for would hire me to do something form home. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could tell the seeker that it is ok to still feel lonely and that she is not alone in that feeling.	labels:I completely understand. I also wish mturk paid more, I feel like it takes a lot of time for not that much money. Do you have a roommate, friend, or family member's car you could possibly borrow instead of using your own?
text:No, I live with housemates but they all don't drive. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter should tell the seeker to focus on what she can control.	labels:I understand.. Are you still looking for and applying for jobs?

The seeker feels lonely and down, but the supporter could tell the seeker that there is a lot of work available for people in her situation and that she should continue to apply for jobs.	labels:If you worked in audio I know that some places, like Upwork and ACX (which does some audiobook work) are looking for audio editing. I am sure that other places are looking for audio editing. I think Fiverr may also be a good place to advertise audio work. I also have an Etsy and Ebay shop, you could possibly sell some of your carpentry work on there if that is possible. Ebay is free to list and Etsy has a small listing fee.

The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of people around her to help her.	labels:I see. You know if you get a mirror and look in it you'll see you are a natural leader. Here's the proof; You realized there's a problem. 2. You reached out for help. 3. You are aware of issues that are bigger than yourself. those are qualities of a leader. Have you thought about starting an online support group for parents? You would be good at it I bet.
text:I really appreciate you saying that. I used to be in a bunch of online support groups for single parents but life kind of got in the way and I didn't have a lot of time to focus on myself. I always had to be there for my son. The seeker feels lonely and isolated, but the supporter gives her some encouragement and a plan of action.	labels:That's understandable. Most parents feel like you do so you're not alone. When I feel closed off I write. I make up stories where I'm always the heroe. Don't laugh. I always overcome some issue.

Are these activities you might like to try? Friend are you still there? Hello?

The seeker feels depressed and lonely. The supporter could discuss the reason why the seeker is feeling so down.	labels:Sorry to hear that.  It is really tough being restricted to not travelling. I call my parents (around your age) about once a week.

The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on what she has and that she is in a good position.	labels:Do you have family you can talk to? Have you considered volunteering?  I ask because my neighbor bakes for the local food bank and it helps her.
text:Yes, I do, but I can't talk to my son in Florida because he lost his job and havng  tough time.  I don't feel like I should enjoy my life when he is suffering.  We may need to help him financially.  I use to volunteer at a nursing home, but I am afraid to now with the virus. The seeker feels lonely because she wants to travel with her husband.	labels:That is reasonable.  And it sounds like you are doing all you can. Could you teach from home online and keep yourself safe?  Or perhaps provide your son financial support?
text: I am trying to do what I can for my son and also to help so I don't get too down and depressed. The seeker happy and the supporter is glad to support.	labels:You are doing everything you can.  Some things are just beyond our control. And we are all struggling, so please know you are not alone in your feelings.

The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker he's in a lonely place and she is feeling the same as well.	labels:i surely understand you. this pandemic has been really stressful..
text:yeah you bet. for example, I only go out once or twice a week for my job, and once every two weeks for groceries. And that's it. But even then, when I have to be in close quarters with coworkers and even to go out for groceries, that scares me. The seeker feels anxious about going out for groceries. The supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter is not alone. The supporter could also suggest the seeker to think about ways that she can still get the groceries.	labels:yeah, people are not social distancing enough.. but wearing a mask and then using sanitizer should at least give us a bit of a confidence.
text:like it was only this tuesday when my city finally acknowledge there's community spread and second wave, when it has been happening slowly for the last two weeks! it's irresponsible and they share information slowly to the public and don't disclose enough information. And they are still not shutting down gyms or restaurants, when they are the main sources right now in my city. The seeker feels lonely and anxious. The supporter should try to calm the seeker by reminding her that she has people around her to help her in any way she need.	labels:at least now i hope the city will put in more restrictions and mandate mask wearing.
text:yeah I have been doing all that, with the washing of the hands and so forth. The situation at my job is unavoidable but I am still as careful as I try to cope. well, it's only today they brought the limit to social gatherings from 10 to 5. The seeker feels stressed with the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:have you tried reaching out to mayor's office to see if there is any way you could request for more restrictions. most of the cities do have a hotline or a channel for residents to give suggestions or request something.
text:too slow and they don't believe in shutting down essential businesses when that will stop it once and for all after two or three weeks. They did that earlier this year for the first wave and that pretty much did the trick. And today they openly said that unless deemed necessary, they will only shut down selective places because restaurants need to stay open for business, etc. The seeker feels stressed from the pandemic. The supporter should respond to the seeker's concern by pointing out the fact that they are doing all the right things to be cautious.	labels:hmm, that's a bummer.
text:yeah there's a local line but it's a pretty big city and it wouldn't really matter what I say. The seeker is feeling lonely and stressed because of the pandemic and the situation at her work. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the problems at work.	labels:okay.
text:but anyhow, I have been conferring with my friend pretty much daily on the phone and that does help with social support. But thanks for that advice, it's a good idea. The seeker feels lonely, worried and scared. The supporter should listen to the seeker and provide positive words of encouragement.	labels:that's great. having a supportive friend/family is so much a blessing during this pandemic.
text:yes definitely, since I live alone and pretty much self isolated since March of this year. I have gotten used to it and more comfortable. Before I was more nervous, lonely, and claustrophobic. It is better now but my fear is coming back due to the rising cases. The seeker is worried about the rising cases but does not explain why. The supporter can ask for more details.	labels:yeah, i can understand.. do you have any hobbies or interests that you can work on to help you put your mind away for sometime?
text:yeah thanks for listening. And this does impact my daily routines, from my workout patterns, sleep patterns, and diet. yeah somewhat. but not productive energy. I tend to be lethargic, immobile at my computer for long times, surfing the net aimlessly when I should be studying, and just distracted. The seeker feels that there are changes to her daily routine, and the supporter is asking the seeker to describe these changes.	labels:there are a good number of online forums for most of the hobbies/interests.. that'll help you share your work and also get some additional ideas.
text:and I sleep real late and wake up real late. It's all backwards and unhealthy and I am disappointed in myself. I also work out less because I can work out at home but I have done that less and less as somehow I don't feel motivated. okay yeah good idea. I can look for more videos too on such resources. like I don't play any musical instruments but that would be great for a distraction like that or to pass time or to improve on a craft or project. The seeker feels overwhelmed, but the supporter is not aware of that. The supporter should ask the seeker more about the cause of her emotional state.	labels:putting away my phone has helped me a lot. also, i have designed a daily routine to include more of the tasks that i like.
text:Just pretty much my studies with two online courses and not even reading anything outside of school. And even then, my school work ethics suck and I am kind of disappointed at my lapses that way. ok yeah great ideas. The seeker feels stressed and anxious, but the supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:yeah, try to start learning a new musical instrument of your choice. maybe just 30-60 mins everyday.
text:I have started to put away my phone. as I realize that I use it a lot too. The seeker feels that she has low self-esteem and has been lethargic and unproductive. The supporter could ask the seeker about the reason of her low self-esteem.	labels:nice.
text:So I put it at the opposite end of my room for example. started doing that lately and so the screen time has reduced somewhat. so just trying to channel my productive energy into finishing school deadlines. The seeker feels overwhelmed and stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker if she is able to focus on her school work.	labels:social media and then this relentless flow of covid news/info is also stressful.
text:yeah for sure, especially following up news from around the world and in the states. just stressful loads of news just catching up to daily events. and as for daily schedule, yes I have kind of more control on that too as I try to write down what I should do now and set an alarm to start doing this at this time etc, especially in juggling my school work. but yeah your ideas are great and match my thinking exactly. The seeker still feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker how he is doing and what he is doing to help.	labels:yepp. i read a book - 'atomic habits'. and kind of designed a daily routine. this helping me a lot and reducing stress as well..
text:I see. okay I will keep doing that. I will search that book too, interesting title. The seeker is feeling relieved and more confident. The supporter should ask the seeker to tell more about the pandemic situation and what the seeker is dealing with.	labels:and also try and note down things that stress or upset you. and then over a period try to avoid those triggers..
text:okay then. I am good to go on that note. Thanks for reaching out and listening.

The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved, and that the supporter has designed a daily routine to help the seeker be less stressed.	labels:yepp. and if you try to remove or avoid those triggers, it will really help.

text:yeah I am okay. They are coming to an end at end of this month and next so dialing down so I am at a crunch period. Thank you again and I hope you well also. And keep staying well and safe. The seeker and the supporter both feel a bit stressed.	labels:you are welcome. stay safe and be happy :).	episode_done:True

I don;t even think I miss him, I'm just mad about how he went about it. The seeker feels a little lonely but not stressed. It would be more helpful to the seeker to mention the reason she feels lonely.	labels:That is cruel, I am sure you are in shock, to leave without an explanation, or a real one is terrible. So you have no contact withim what so ever?
text:No contact, I sort of lost my temper when he tried to talk things over because I think he was going to use this as a threat but I was so disgusted after being tired from work that I just threw my phone and now my way of contacting him is gone. The seeker feels lonely and angry. She thinks her boyfriend has gone crazy. The supporter should try to help the seeker feel better.	labels:Maybe that is not all bad, gives him time to think and you too. And if he regrets what he did he will return. But then you would have to make a decission, if you would want him back..
text:I sort of don't think I want him back. Not when he thinks our relationship is some sort of pawn for him to hold over my head. It sucks because my parents didn't even like him, I stuck my neck out for him and now this happens. The seeker feels lonely and she wants to talk to the supporter. The supporter tries to cheer her up and tell her that others are around her.	labels:Well I am sure it sucks and feels a bit lonely. But if you dont want him back have a glass of wine and celebrate the you, you deserve the best and nothing less.

text:Thanks for listening to me gripe about this, I was just shocked, you know? Like ten years gone down the drain but I guess that's life. A kitten definitely sounds like a good idea. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker to look at the positive things in her life and think about her new nephew.	labels:Sometimes it just is, but out of all the bad things something good comes out of it you might not just see it now. Take care of yourself.

The supporter should say the following:	labels:just try to coming outdon't shiver and dont feel useless.

text:Yes, i like to be up to enjoy the mornings but i am also hard to get woken up. I like to stay up, but when it's time to get up i dread it. Bad cycle. The seeker sad about the days getting shorter. The supporter should tell the seeker that there are some techniques that she could use to help her feel better.	labels:Sure, that's understandable.

text:I guess it's like you said before, we can only change ourselves. The seeker ling anxious and insecure and the supporter tries to ease the seeker's stress.	labels:So everyone's plans are canceled for the year, plus no one has any idea when the shit's going to end, so not unlike a dog at the vet, the suffering seems interminable. .

text:and meanwhile, have one assignment from this course also at the end of this month, and another course's assignment, and that course's exam is coming up next month. yeah just trying to load myself up with coffee. I am used to the idea of staying up because I have been doing that since the pandemic early on this year, but I seem to be distracted and procrastinating, especially in the early hours of the morning, and just go on the computer and waste time, etc. it's kind of hard to sit myself down I guess.

text:And another thing is by the time I get wise up to not procrastinate, like around 3 or 4 am, I become tired and sleepy, and my brain kicks in and immediately doesn't cooperate.

text:Yes, how the pandemic will play out mostly. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Things are very uncertain these days.  I certainly have never experienced anything like it. .
text:I guess we are all in the same boat. The seeker very worried about the pandemic. The supporter could tell the seeker that the pandemic was happening and how bad things were.	labels:Personally, I have tried to lessen my anxiety by limiting my intake of news and social media.  No matter what one might believe, there's always someone out there that's apparently going to take it to an extreme, and reading over and over about that is emotionally exhausting. .
text:I think that definitely plays into it. I want to be informed, but not diluged. The seeker s worried and anxious about the future.

text:I may overtrust. The seeker xious and lonely. The supporter could encourage the seeker to focus on the positive.	labels:But again, you cannot control how they react, you can only control yourself.  And that's not to say you can turn off your emotions or anything, but once you let go of the idea that you can control someone else to your liking, you will feel better.  Less out of control.  Because that's a lot of what is disturbing about the pandemic.  We have zero control over it. .
text:You're good at this. Thanks for your support. Ending chat when timer allows. The seeker ely and anxious, but the supporter gives some helpful tips and suggestions.	labels:Sure thing, I wish you luck, and thank you for the compliment :-) .	episode_done:True
text:Hello I would like to talk to you regarding my daily stresses. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The reason of loneliness is not mentioned, and the supporter can't guess it. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk.	labels:sure, please go ahead and share your story.
text:pretty much being social isolated due to the pandemic, trying to finish up my studies at the same time, and what's going on in the world with regards to the pandemic. My physical and mental health aren't great, and I am not eating as well as I should or sleeping as well as I should. I guess we all go through that in different ways with the pandemic now. The seeker feels lonely and isolated because of the pandemic. The supporter should help the seeker to focus on the support she has and the people around her.	labels:it sounds like you are having depression, have you shared your problems with anyone?
text:yes sure, I chat with my friend everyday on the phone and that helps to talk about each other's day and my thoughts and feelings, observations with the world etc. The seeker is being open with her supporter. The supporter can help the seeker to focus on her health and mental health.	labels:that's great! Friends can be big help.
text:I am just not able to help my tendencies to sleep really late and wake up late. My sleep pattern is really abnormal and I am disappointed in myself. It's not much about the pandemic as just gotten a really bad habit and trying to stay up late and watch movies or catch up with my work. Then it's a vicious circle in which the next day I wake up late, and my day starts late, and so to get as much done, I repeat the same damaging cycle. The seeker feels depressed. The supporter could help the seeker get in touch with her real feelings about the pandemic.	labels:If you have time, spend at least 1-2h everyday outdoor. You can talk a walk in the park or just simply go to the stores.
text:So I am having real trouble breaking this pattern. And because I work once or twice a week and not during the day, I don't even have the motivation or need to wake up early. I go out only for personal errands and that's once every week or two weeks. I still am not prepared to go out even for walks. But that's just my stubborn thinking. The seeker feel sleepy and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to do some relaxation activities every day.	labels:In order to have better sleep pattern, maybe you should exercise, at first your body will be tired which helps you sleep better and earlier. spending too much time indoor is very damaging to your mentality. Even the most normal person will go crazy at that rate.
text:My thinking is that I had stuck to this for so long it's not my style to compromise and I tend to be stubborn. And that if I had done that, I would have done that early on this year. But other people are doing it but it's also coupled with the pandemic in which I just don't think I or anyone should risk that, since I am basically sacrificing myself, while others in my apartment building are walking freely in and out. So that's my thinking. Yes I understand. I do know it's bad to get stuck indoors. Believe me, before all this, I was going out many times a week to the movies and to the gym. The seeker is depressed. The supporter should offer the seeker some advice.	labels:I feel you, when everything starts closing down again. I also feel angry because I've been doing everything right and now am punished because of other selfish people.
text:Now I just do a lot of time nothing but on the computer or in my studies. A lot of the time aimless, not even studying that well or using my time well. And I don't have the same motivation to work out that much at home, which I used to do a lot. exactly. I understand your feelings too on that. A lot of selfish people inviting others indoors or going out, even a few months ago when the cases were just dropping and they didn't take enough time to wait but immediately lift their own restriction and go out. The seeker has some concerns and her supporter could address them as necessary.	labels:I'm also sick of the repetition too. Everyday I go to work then go home and just get stuck there all nigh every day. However, we need to tell ourselves that this too shall pass.
text:But even when there were a lot of cases, there are some people on my floor that walked freely in and out many times in one day when it wasn't safe for anyone. And I didn't get that at all and that was when I was angry and anxious of their actions. Because that risked my safety too. sorry to hear that you have similar repetitions. That's how it feels. Everyday is the same. And when I talk with my folks on the phone, I have nothing new to share except about the pandemic, because that's the only thing new, and I only call the once a week. But yes, I do believe that it will pass at some point. The seeker feels lonely, stressed, anxious and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone in having these feelings, and that she can talk to her supporters daily. 	labels:that's the right way of thinking. You're doing this not only for yourself but for everyone else.
text:yeah that's why I told myself early on I am doing this for everyone and I couldn't compromise no matter what. Perhaps too stringent but that was my thinking. The seeker feels lonely and hopeless. The supporter tells the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:I try to stay away from the news or talking about covid, mostly because it's gonna be the same information and only depresses us even more.
text:And it's better now and I am kind of used to this endless cycle. I used to feel even lonelier and claustrophobic. I see. Well I do hope and it does sound like you are adapting to this well so far and staying sane. So that's good. The seeker feels lonely and stressed, the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I don't think I am better than you but we have to try nonetheless.
text:And what sucks even more is that my city is just beginning its second wave as of about two weeks ago. So it's just starting to ramp up. Yes I agree. Just stay strong. And one thing I told myself is that years from now I can imagine myself in that future time and thinking back to a dark, bad year, and say and think to myself that I got through it and that there was an end to the dark tunnel. And that there is an end to this. The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:it's the same for me, businesses are forced to tighten again which is grim. However, the only think we can do now is take 1 day at a time and hope for the best.
text:So that did help even though the future may be relatively far, I was vividly picturing that emotion of that time in the future. yeah good luck to you. And at least your city is deciding to close for the better. My city hasn't even made the call yet even though this is probably the optimal time to do so, early on in the spread where it's controllable. I am sure you will get through this great. We can do it. Actually talking to you now, I feel renewed hope. just kind of summarizing my thoughts and feelings. The seeker feels lonely and stressed out. The supporter could tell the seeker that the situation is not that bad compared to other countries. It is important to realize that everything will be okay.	labels:I believe the same as long as we hang in there. Get help from your friends and family.
text:So thank you for that and for listening and understanding. Yes will continue to do that. The seeker feels lonely due to being isolated from the world. The supporter could help the seeker by reminding the seeker that they are not alone.

text:I am worried about losing my job. The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous. The seeker is worried about losing her job and her company is talking about it. The supporter should ask what is going on in the seeker's life that she is worried about losing her job.	labels:It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.
text:It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that. The seeker feels stress and worry about losing her job. The supporter could ask more questions to get more details.	labels:Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.
text:Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability. The seeker is feeling worried about losing her job and the supporter should ask more about the situation and the seeker's emotional state.	labels:I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?
text:Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.. The seeker shows an anxious emotion. The supporter can help the seeker understand that the job loss is not the end of the world. It doesn't have to be the end of the world. The supporter can help the seeker feel more at ease.	labels:I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.
text:I would hope so. The seeker feels lonely but the supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :) You have every right to feel the way you do though. It's a scary time but know that things will be okay.
text:Right. It's just not something I want to go through again. I just got this job 18 months ago. That job hunting dread and feeling hasn't gone away. The seeker feels stressed, afraid, and lonely. The supporter could suggest something that will help the seeker feel calmer and less stressed. The supporter gives a solution to the seeker to help her feel better.	labels:I understand. It definitely is an agonizing process but you've gone through it before and have 18 months of experience under your belt from your current job which looks good on any resume. Despite the pandemic, I think this will help make things a lot easier for you.
text:For the record, you are doing a really really good job. I really appreciate your time and kind words. Thank you for empathizing and relating. I appreciate your assistance. I feel a lot better about this now :). The seeker feels lonely and worried about losing her job.

text:It's 2020 so there's been a lot going on, but I've been struggling with this before all of that. 2020 has made it much worse though. The seeker explains the reason of her sadness.

text:I live on my own... well at least as the only human. I have a dog. The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:That is great that you at least have your dog. They're great companion.

The supporter could help the seeker know that she is not alone. The supporter could encourage the seeker to know that she is doing good and that people are happy to see her. The supporter could also give some conversation instructions to the seeker.	labels:How about you hang out once a week with your friends and share your problem with them?
text:I wish. We haven't had the time recently to connect due to being so busy. Do you have any tips or ticks for things I can do by myself? The seeker feels isolated, but she has a dog and a friend that she can talk to. The supporter may try to encourage the seeker to talk to her friend and ask what she can do to help.	labels:Of course. Now that covid is closing everything. You can use that time to take a course online for free. Or you can pursue your hobbies.
text:Right. Online courses are fun. The seeker feels lonely and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend.  The supporter should make her feel connected to others and provide a solution to the problem.	labels:Have you tried seeking therapist?

The supporter is able to provide support by reminding the seeker of the people around them. The supporter also offers the seeker some ideas to cheer up.	labels:Me too, I have been trying to teach myself the "one day at a time" mindset to not being paranoid about the future.	episode_done:True

text:nope. i feel that i get enough support from family. it might've been an option if I didn't have a strong support system. The seeker feels alone and stressed out. The supporter should ask the seeker what she is doing in order to cope with this situation.	labels:That's fantastic. Having family around during a tough season like this must be such a blessing. It's great that you can be there for your friend, almost as if they were part of your family, too.
text:yeah they feel like part of the family. i've known them since i was in college 20 years ago. we haven't always talked the whole time but.... The seeker feels lonely, worried and stressed. The supporter should try to connect with the seeker and offer some words of encouragement.	labels:20 years is a long time! It takes a lot of commitment to your friendship to not only keep in touch for that long, but also make the time to support them emotionally when it matters most. You are a loyal friend, and your friend is lucky to have you around!
text:thank ya. him and I are there for each other. We dated briefly at first but have been friends ever since. He said I was the one who got away. But he was the one who ended it lol. The seeker feels lonely. She is alone, not with her boyfriend. The supporter should ask how she is doing when she is alone.	labels:It sounds like you and him have had quite the history, but your friendship has proven to remain strong through thick and thin (20 years!). I can't imagine how stressful it must be to be for him to be waiting for surgery, and I'm sure it means the world to him that you are by his side. How has your friendship been in the midst of everything these days?
text:It's been good. We've been talking about Covid and the election too. I know I'd be nervous to go in for heart surgery. The seeker is feeling lonely, and her friend is by her side. The supporter could encourage the seeker to use the support network she has around her.	labels:That's great to hear. Both COVID and the election have certainly been stressful. What are some ways that you have been able to support each other?
text:just being there for each other as a listening ear. The seeker feels lonely and stressed.	labels:It's so easy to feel alone these days. Sometimes being present is all you can do, but it's the absolute best thing that you can do. Keep going, you're doing great!

text:Very sad.  I think about him often. The seeker is depressed. The supporter should provide a solution for the seeker to get through the sad thoughts and emotions.	labels:It is sad indeed having a loved one past. Having time will help.
text:Yes but how much time? The seeker wants to know how much time is needed and the supporter should tell her that time will heal.	labels:Some takes weeks. Others take month or years. It's different for everyone. I know where you are coming from. I lost my husband a couple years ago and it took me awhile to move on as well.
text:I'm so sorry.  It is very hard, isn't it?  I know time is helping, but sometimes, like today, it's just overwhelming how much I miss him. The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could offer to give the seeker a hug.	labels:I think perhaps you could think of the wonderful times that you spent with your fiance, and cherish those feelings.
text:Yes, I do try.  Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward? The seeker is sad and overwhelmed. The supporter could find the reason of the sadness and help her through that.	labels:I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?
text:Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies.  Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll.  Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me.  He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:That is so sweet. How are you feeling now with all these memories coming back to you?
text:actually i am feeling somewhat better.  still sad, but it's good to remember those things.  thank you. i appreciate your time and understanding.  I hope you are able to remember your good times as well. The seeker feels lonely and sad, and the supporter helps the seeker to remember some good times with her loved one.	labels:Other ways to cope is perhaps taking a new hobby. Do you have any new interest that you would like to try? I took up a cooking class a few months after my husband past away, and I really enjoyed it.
text:i've been trying to figure out a hobby ... but i haven't really found anything that appeals to me.  a cooking class sounds interesting though. i might learn how to do things in the kitchen without injuring myself. I tend to be clumsy at the best of times and have done things such as (most recently) dropping a scalding bowl of chili on my foot.  I tend to wait to do new things til the last injury heals. The seeker as a new hobby of cooking. The helper can ask the seeker more questions to help the seeker identify the emotion she is feeling.	labels:I think you will do fine in the kitchen once you get the hang of it. What are some of your favorite food?
text:hmmm.  i love tacos.  and stews.  cheesecake. i used to bake ... but i'm diabetic so that's probably not such a good idea any more.  and since we're working at home now i can't bake and take it into the office for people to enjoy. The seeker feels lonely and sad, and the supporter should encourage her to think about the good times they had with their loved ones.	labels:Yes, I enjoy tacos and cheesecake as well, especially from the Cheesecake Factory.
text:oh my yes, the Cheesecake Factory has amazing cheesecake. I am going to go now. Thank you very much for your support. It helps to have an "ear" ... just to be able to talk about it and be reminded that it's all going to be okay.  Plus, that there's cheesecake in the world, so it can't all be bad, right? The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could talk to the seeker about the seeker's feelings and the reason for those feelings.	labels:Okay, I'm glad you are feeling better. Enjoy the rest of your day and stay safe.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there! How are you today?\nIm okay. How do you want to do this? The seeker is very happy, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker why she is happy, and give some conversation instructions.	labels:Sure! Can you please tell me how can i help you today?
text:Ive been feeling like other people dont like me. The seeker feels lonely and is trying to make others feel like she is okay. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone.	labels:If I understand you correctly, do you assume people dislike you even if you can't tell for sure?
text:Yes, i automatically assume I'm valueless in the other persons eyes, no matter what they say or do to the contrary. The seeker feels that people don't like her. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is good enough and has value.	labels:It seems you are a bit low on self-confidence. I have been there too. If I may ask you, does this feeling persist all the time irrespective of the situation or it happens after any particular event - say a test or some outdoor game for example?
text:Yeah, I've been texting my friend and he doesn't reply to me for hours and it makes me feel like he isnt as enthusiastic about our friendship as i am which hurts. The seeker feels like she is not liked by others. She is also concerned that she is not valued by others. The supporter should point out that she is not unliked and that others do like her.	labels:Right, the feeling of being ignored can be quite overwhelming. Have you tried speaking with your friend over phone or video call, assuming you have access to the technology?
text:We have decent phone conversations, I guess I'm just frustrated and sad about my worthiness, now that im typing it out it sounds not nearly as bad. Thank you. The seeker feels lonely and upset that she is not popular enough. The supporter could talk about why the other people might not like her.	labels:Great! You are worthy! Remember that always :) Is there anything else I can help you with?
text:Haha thank you. What do you think i should do when i feel this way next time. The seeker is feeling unimportant and doesn't know what to do next. The supporter could suggest the seeker to make a list of people who like her, and give her a call to ask how they are doing. Or, the supporter could suggest the seeker to spend time with her friends and family.	labels:Good question! Don't let the feeling consume you. After all , you are dealing with another person who genuinely might be busy or held up with some important work.
text:Thats true. The seeker tells her supporter that she feels unimportant and she cannot understand why her friend has ignored her. The supporter could encourage the seeker to try to understand the other person's life and priorities.	labels:So, even if they don't respond, just think they are driving or working, and try to avoid thinking that you are being ignored.
text:I always assume since im not busy that they arent too. I guessits a little self involved. The seeker is feeling lonely, but the supporter is trying to help the seeker to not think that way.	labels:Yes, sometimes assumptions can lead to misunderstandings. Always talk it out when you get a chance. It could be, but always bear in mind that there could be factors beyond your immediate control.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you doing?  How can I help you?\nhello. i have constant anxiety about my future and job applications. The seeker feels anxiety.

The seeker feels anxious about her future and job applications, which is causing the anxiety.	labels:That sounds like a challenge but you can be proud that you are working so hard.
text:thank you I really appreciate that. The seeker feels anxious and the supporter could tell the seeker that she needs to take a break from worrying and start doing something to feel better.	labels:Do you have anyone who can help support you through the process?
text:my husband is supportive. he is more easy going than me. so he thinks I stress too much. The seeker feels anxious and stressed. The supporter could help the seeker to relax.	labels:It seems like your husband is very supportive but feels you stress a lot.  Is that right?
text:yes correct. The seeker feels lonely and stressed to do the job applications. The supporter could help the seeker get over the feeling being stressed with the job application and anxiety about the future.	labels:It sounds like you are stressed about the situation and want to find a path forward.
text:yes I just feel insecure and that I will not get the job i want. The seeker feels stressed and insecure, and that she will not get the job she wants. The supporter could encourage the seeker to take a step back of the situation and calm her body down.	labels:Have you thought about going to a job center to seek out help. .
text:its actually applying for a medical fellowship so it is a little different.. The seeker feels stressed and insecure. The supporter should give some suggestions for the seeker to feel more supported.	labels:Are there other people in your position that you can talk to or counselors to guide you and encourage you through the process?

text:yeah. Im getting pretty close and I can't afford to fail my courses. The seeker is feeling scared, stressed and worried about her schooling. The supporter should work on reassuring the seeker that she is not alone.	labels:Have you tried tutor service at school? They usually provide free of charge or very cheap.
text:I've looked around and there arn't any good tutoring services for my field of study. I've tried reaching out for help but Im still doing poorly. The seeker feels scared and needs help. The supporter should suggest her to seek out the help of a tutor.	labels:It must be frustrated for you..
text:Yea im very frustrated at myself. I just can't seem to do well no matter how hard I try. The seeker is feeling scared and hopeless. The supporter should encourage the seeker to look at the bright side.	labels:How about talking to your professors about that you don't understand and how they can help?
text:Maybe. I haven't tried that yet. do you think they would help me? The seeker is feeling frustrated and down because of her grades. The supporter could offer her some solutions.	labels:don't be too harsh on yourself. We all struggle in life. As long as we find an appropriate solution, I believe you will get better. Of course, it's their job after all.
text:Im trying not to be too hard on myself but it's really scary not knowing if i'll pass the next wave of exams. Ill try asking my profs thats a good idea, they can probably give me some good guidance. The seeker feels frustrated about her schooling. The supporter should tell her that she will feel better if she tells her professors how she feels, even if they don't listen.	labels:I feel you. it's scary when everyone seems to do fine but you struggle. However, others struggle silently too, they just like you don't tell anyone.
text:I guess you're right. The seeker feels anxious about her schooling. She feels scared and thinks that she cannot afford to fail her courses.

They tend to be more friendly.
text:Ill reach out to them too. The seeker feels scared and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved and cared for.	labels:you can also ask your friends to form a study group.
text:I think I will do that. im sure they have some of the same questions as I do :) The seeker finds a tutor and ask for help. She feels like she won't pass the exams and she is frustrated. The supporter could help her feel better by trying to make her feel that she can do well.	labels:yes, and maybe you will understand parts that some of them don't.
text:Yeah you're right. maybe I'm not as hopeless as I thought. The seeker feels stressed but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should focus on the emotions of the seeker.	labels:of course, I also struggle all the time.
text:yea we all struggle all the time. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could ask the seeker about some things that make her smile.	labels:Anything else I can help you with?

text:im doing ok just a bit sad. hbu. The seeker feels the supporter is a bit distant and not really paying attention to her. The supporter should pay more attention to the conversation.	labels:I am fine! Thanks for asking. May I know the reason you are sad, if you'd like to share?
text:Yeah I'm just sad that I havent been able to see my friends in a long time. I had a very stron social support group but ever since the lock down I havent really been able to see anyone. The seeker is feeling sad because of the social isolation. The supporter could ask the seeker if there are any activities she is interested in doing.	labels:I understand exactly how you feel.

But, this pandemic is never-seen-before event and certain restrictions are unavoidable and life saving.
text:Im sorry to hear that :( yeah the virus has been putting a huge damper on everyone's mood. I just miss seeing my friends. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:All of us are in this together and if you tolerate short term inconveniences (lockdown, masking up, social distancing), long term benefits are multi fold. You want your friends to be around when all of this is over, am I right?
text:I hope they wil be. Yeah social distancing is a must I wouldnt want to get sick. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are many people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Apologies, I didn't mean to make you sad further by sharing my own sob story!

The supporter can tell the seeker the she has many friends who are willing to help and support her. 	labels:Sure! At the end of the day, health is wealth. Vaccines are already on their way and this too shall pass. So, hang in there :) That's a great choice. Small steps we take now will ensure great benefits later.

text:I have. I've worked on my schoolwork, but it has been very easy. I also paint. But I need people.. At home, I had all my friends around. Of course, we weren't in a pandemic then. This pandemic is making everyone feel lonely I think. The seeker feels lonely, especially about her new environment. The supporter should focus on the seeker's current situation, not the past.  The supporter should tell the seeker she is lonely too.	labels:How about doing video call with your friends at home?
text:I hadn't thought about that!  They are all at different schools, but maybe I can do a Zoom meeting for all of us.

text:That sounds like fun! Why don't you do a virtual happy hour every week? The seeker is feeling sad and lonely, but the supporter would encourage the seeker to make new friends.	labels:Not only that, when you feel lonely, text your friends and share it with them or your family. Oh I am too busy to do that once a week. All of us are actually.

I want them to know I'm lonely, but not freak out about it :-) The seeker feels lonely and stressed out. The supporter is encouraging the seeker to seek help from the friend.	labels:I don't think so. Maybe they are waiting for you to say first and give you advice, they have more experience after all.
text:That's true. And I do know my mom is working from home now and she's a really social person. It's probably getting to her too. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter should help the seeker to calm down by helping her to feel loved.	labels:if that's the case, you can use this chance to be there for her. I think talking to your mom will help you both.
text:Yes, I'll probably call her and my dad tonight. I'll let them know I'm a bit sad and lonely, but not so much that they worry. And then I'll start planning my virtual party with my friends! The seeker feels lonely and stressed, but the supporter could tell the seeker to take action on his own.	labels:Sounds like a great plan. I believe you can overcome this together.
text:At least the party will give me something to look forward to! The seeker does not feel lonely but rather happy. The supporter should ask the seeker more questions about the stressful situation.	labels:Yes, right now I'm trying to teach myself one day at a time mindset.

Thank you for helping me come up with a plan! The seeker feels stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:That's the right mindset. I 'm glad I could be some help.
text:Enjoy the rest of your night! The seeker feels lonely and stressed out about the COVID-19 situation. The supporter should try to comfort the seeker.	labels:you too.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels lonely and there are no people around her to make her feel being loved. The supporter could tell the seeker she is not alone and that there are people around her, and she could even help the seeker to know more about them.	labels:Good evening ! How are you on this cold fall night.
text:Not too good. I am owed a lot of money by my friends but they aren't paying me back blaming covid. The seeker is feeling stressed and lonely and the supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I can understand how stressful this could be for you! I would feel taken advantage of too. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. Have you asked them when they thought they could pay you. sorry I am not sure why it typed twice. Have your friends ever borrowed money before?
text:Yes, as recently as yesterday, but they keep delaying. And as though rubbing salt to wound, I can see them spending on personal goods instead of returning the money to me. The seeker feels taken advantage of and upset. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not alone.	labels:I would be furious too!.
text:I am not sure if they have borrowed before, but sure as hell, they have not returning any loan I can tell. *they are not. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter could ask the seeker if she has friends to talk to and help her.	labels:I just meant if they had borrowed in past and returned it than maybe they were telling the truth but since you saw them blowing money that s rightfully yours is a problem. Can you talk to a mutual friend of both of you or if you are close maybe their family ?
text:Absolutely. This has put me in a tight spot financially. I can try talking to their family but I am afraid I am not that close to their family. The seeker s worried about being taken advantage of and is not sure if she should talk to her friends or their family. The supporter could tell her how he feels about her friends and family and whether he thinks they are telling the truth about the money they have borrowed from her.	labels:I understand and have been in your shoes and its NO FUN and they don't get to borrow ever again. . Have you explained just how much of an issue it is to them and flat out tell them you saw them spending money on junk etc when they could have given to you . Something is better than nothing . Maybe work out a plan of 50 a week if they work?
text:May be I can try that, $50 a week or asking them to pay in instalments sounds like a good idea. Problem is I loaned hard cash and I need as cash, not digital transfers. The seeker s stressed and is worried about her friend's behaviour. The supporter should ask the seeker questions that help her think through the situation.	labels:And depending on how much of a  friend they are you need to see if this is worth losing friendship over. I mean if you are great friends I d lay low and never let them borrow again. IF you only knew them a short while and felt sorry for them and lent them money than I D talk to parents or someone.
text:I don't want to lose my friends, because they are the only people that helped me when I shifted to this city. But I don't like them taking undue advantage of me either. The seeker eeling stressed and lonely. The supporter makes the seeker feel confident and positive.	labels:Id be like I helped you when you needed xxx to do get buyxxx . Now its becoming an issue and I can't pay my bills.  I wanted to help you now can you please give me cash of xxx for xxx starting next friday.. Yes friends are hard to come by and you certainly don't need anyone to ever take advantage of you.   But the other side is do you want this person to be your friend if you can't trust them and they are showing you no disrespect or attempt to pay you back?
text:It's a good plan. Due to lockdown restrictions, I am unable to travel places. May be if I show up at their doors, they'll pay me back. I am gonna see if talking to them and asking for small payments works first. The seeker stressed and lonely. The supporter should help the seeker by making her feel safe to talk to her friends and loved ones.	labels:Awesome!  Good luck! If that doesn't work we can chat again and try something else. Keep safe and Keep the faith .  Personally I would recommend praying if you believe as I do!!!
text:Yes, I do pray and it has worked in the past. Let me try to stay calm and follow your ideas. Thanks! The seeker lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker about the people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Ok . Good luck.	episode_done:True

text:I can't unfortunately. No one involved in the case may speak to each other. The seeker feels that someone is not listening to her and she is feeling a little lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are many people around her to help her.	labels:it sounds like you are really stressed out about the situation and are overwhelmed with how to figure out a path forward.
text:Yes, it has been difficult and I feel very alone. Thank you for listening. The seeker is feeling lonely, but the follower does not know the reason causing the emotion.

text:Hello.\nGood evening! The seeker feels lonely and wants to talk to someone. The supporter could encourage her to call another person.	labels:What's your problem?
text:I am having anger issues and thinking nasty thoughts toward my husband. The seeker felt lonely and angry. The supporter could start by asking the seeker to elaborate about her anger, then asking the seeker to think of something that makes her feel happy.	labels:Is this because of something he does or you are experiencing angry issue with everything?
text:Mostly because of how he treats me lately. He makes disrespectful comments.... Are you female or male. The seeker is very upset with her husband. She wants more details about the disrespectful comments to know if they are serious or not. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not a perfect person, but she is nice and a good person.	labels:So from what I understand, you think your anger is because of your husband's fault. Have you talked to him about his behavior? I am female.
text:No it wouldn't do any good I am afraid. Whenever I try to stand up for myself he says Oh here we go again Poor you etc. Like just tonight I mopped floor and he came up and said What are you sick ?  Youre actually cleaning. Than I said yes I was actually on my hands and knees last week when I mopped and he. said well get used to being on your knees. and touched himself. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the break up.	labels:That's gross. I can't believe he said all those things to you. I'm sorry you have to hear those words from your husband.
text:He's always saying stuff like that and constantly trying to refer to lets just say going down. The seeker feels angry and has some thoughts about her husband's behavior. The supporter should ask about the reason the spouse is being disrespectful.	labels:You need to stand up for yourself. I know it's difficult and as you said, won't even do any good. However, if you keep your silence, he'd think it's okay to treat you that way because he has power over you.
text:I know even my good friends that know me and everything that is said agrees with you. The seeker has no problem expressing her anger. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is not the only person to have anger issues. It is very common and not unusual for a man to treat a woman like that.	labels:I'd advise you to disclose this to a family member and have them with you (on the phone) when he starts talking like that. that way the other person can call him off.
text:My mom already knows and his parents are dead and he has no relations with any other family. . HE wont listen He knows everything and its HIs way or else. He is very controlling. The seeker feels angry and sad. The supporter gives the seeker a phone call to have a family member with her and to stop her husband from talking like that.	labels:if you want, you can talk to him one last time and let him know it's enough. I fhe doesn't change, you will cut off with him. You have to stand up for you self first before expecting him to do that.
text:Thats true and its time for a change. Thank you so much . I do feel better. The seeker feels lonely. Her supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:If he intimidates you, you should practice what to say and then do the talk in public or when someone else is around. I believe you can do it.
text:Thank you . Its sounds like you know what you are talking about. Ill try it. The seeker feels lonely and stressed.

text:yes i have years ago. and he threatened to take boys. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask the seeker more details.	labels:Then you should do it for real this time and see if he changes..
text:and he would prove I am an unfit mom. The seeker not feeling lonely, but the supporter should know that the seeker is feeling stressed and depressed. The supporter should know that the seeker has been struggling for years with her husband. The supporter should also know that her husband is an alcoholic.	labels:The mom always has an upper hand in these issues.
text:but he has photos of dirty house and that I was dignosed with major clinical depression. The seeker feels lonely and is afraid to tell the truth. She also tells the supporter she was diagnosed with a major clinical depression.	labels:You should also have photos of clean house to prove against him.
text:I do. The seeker l threatened and intimidated by her husband. She should practice what to say, in front of someone else and do it in public.	labels:as for depression, as long as you have proof youre seeking treatment, you should be fine.
text:I used to but he wont let me get treatment. He doesnt believe in therapy for me him familly etc. The seeker feels lonely and worries about her marriage. The supporter could encourage the seeker by saying there is still time to change. The supporter could suggest ways for the seeker to make a change in her marriage, such as, taking photos of a clean house, threatening to leave her husband, and get treatment for her depression.	labels:do it secretly, behind his back.
text:there is no way I can. he tracks everything. The seeker feels lonely, stressed, depressed and worried about her relationship with her boyfriend because of his treatment and threats to take her children. The supporter could tell the seeker that the seeker has a good reason to feel these emotions, and advise the seeker to do something about it.	labels:it all comes down to you have to let him see that you can stand on your own. He's treating you like this because he thinks he can control you.
text:ok I need to go take care keep safe. The seeker feels that she can not get treatment and that she will be sent to jail if she get treatment. The supporter should ask her what she thinks that could happen.	labels:hope you will be fine.	episode_done:True

The supporter can tell the seeker that she is thinking of her and wants to make sure she is having fun.	labels:Oh I definitely know the feeling of not hanging out with friends.  This has really been a bad year! Do you ever Zoom with your friends?
text:No not really. I havent had a lot of time recently because of my studies :( I message them once in awhile om facebook but we havent chatted much. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Messaging on Facebook isn't quite as fun as hanging out in person.  I use Zoom to meetup with family and friends.  I had never heard of it until this pandemic hit.
text:Yeah i havent heard of it either before covid. I use it sometimes for class but never for chatting with friends. I just wish we could hang out again you know? The seeker is lonely and feels sad. The supporter should try to make sure that the supporter feels that the seeker is worth the time and effort.	labels:I most certainly do know!  I just think to myself daily that this vaccine is going to get things back to normal.  Hang on, we're almost there.  In the meantime I suggest Zoom.  It really does make things somewhat less isolating.
text:Thank goodness the vaccine is being developed. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter should give the seeker a lot of encouragement, comfort and positive perspective.	labels:We're almost there!
text:Yeah i guess ill give zoom a try. do you and your friends do anything on zoom or just chat? The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter does not provide any conversation instructions for the seeker.	labels:And if you have an iphone facetime some folks.  Zoom and Facetime are my friends now.  lol I almost daily at least Facetime my best friend. Especially in the evenings.
text:Yeah I think ill try that. Chatting with my friends and seeing them (online) will hopefully make me feel better. thanks :) The seeker feels lonely and sad, and also she doesn't feel like she is being listened to. The supporter should listen carefully and find out what the seeker is really feeling.	labels:I would try it.  Also Meetup is doing virtual meetings. . You're welcome!  We have to look out for one another!
text:Ill give them a shot :) thanks for your time. have  a good day. The seeker does not feel lonely at all. The supporter could ask the seeker if she would like to socialize to make her feel better. The supporter could also ask the seeker about her current situation in order to help her feel better.	labels:Sounds good! You're more than welcome.  You do the same.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, how are you today?\nokay right now. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason has not been mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. Is there anything in particular you wanted to discuss?
text:i am 66, my immediate family is dead, no kids, in touch only with a cousin who is a very troubled person, sometimes her depression spreads to mine, limited friends, COVID makes conditons more sad. The seeker feels lonely and worried. The supporter could tell the seeker to think of the things she can control, such as contacting a cousin and her friends.	labels:That definitely sounds like a rough situation and I'm sorry to hear about it, though I'm glad you decided to reach out..
text:i unloaded a lot on you but current situations do not feel good. The seeker talks about her situation. The supporter could encourage the seeker by asking more details about her situation and talk about how to feel better.	labels:That's what I'm here for. I want to support you in any way I can, especially given your situation. Did you want to talk just to talk? Or we can discuss a way to work through what you might be dealing with mentally? It also sounds like keeping in touch with your cousin isn't helping in any way, so maybe we can talk about how to handle that? I am entirely at your disposal.
text:she is my age, in a homeless women's, very bad living conditions, she is a mental health client but treatment team seem so to feel that as long as they keep her medicated, their job is done.  she has a dx of bipolar and probably has borderline personality.  her background is similiar to mine,  i cannot abandon her as her other family has done. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her cousin, but the supporter should focus on the issues that are causing the loneliness and the concern of breaking up with her boyfriend.	labels:That's definitely difficult and it's easy to see why it wears on you so much. As much as you don't want to abandon her, it's important to remember to take care of yourself too. It's like when you're on a plane and the safety pamphlet tells you to put on your own oxygen mask before helping others with theirs. You might not be able to help your cousin as much as you want to if you are suffering too much. Are there any mental health resources you've tried for yourself other than reaching out here?
text:on antidepressant meds, COVID makes it hard to keep in touch with provider, your comparison about the oxygen mask is a good one. . The seeker feels lonely and lost. She feels like she is the only one who is not happy. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her who are trying to help and support her.	labels:I see, it certainly doesn't help that it's difficult to keep in touch with your provider. I have a website that contains a list of support groups provided by NAMI. Would you be interested in it? Many of the support groups are offered multiple times a week online, so you wouldn't even have to leave your home.
text:a possible path to look into. thanks. The seeker felt lonely and sad because she is alone with a troubled cousin who is a mental health client. The supporter could explain that the seeker is in a tough situation and a lot of people in her life are in the same situation. The supporter could also explain that the seeker should be careful of the person's health in addition to herself. The supporter could also encourage the seeker to seek help from the NAMI	labels:Of course, here's the link: namimainlinepa.org/online-and-telephone-support-groups/.
text:thanks. may be a good time to close on a positive note.  like suggestions. The seeker is feeling lonely and has limited support. The supporter could tell the seeker she has a list of support groups and offers to help connect them to the ones she finds helpful.	labels:Sounds good. Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?
text:not right now but thanks for your concern. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter is able to comfort her in a supportive way.	labels:Alright. You're welcome, it's what I'm here for. I hope you have a good rest of your day!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend, and she feels like she is the only one. The supporter could tell her that she is not alone.	labels:Hello :)
text:This is a tough one. since starting a new job and being around really smart people and feeling that I can't really measure up anymore. I'm finding this really tough, I'm good at my job I'm very committed but I just don't seem to get the same results as others? The seeker feels lonely or unhappy. You could tell the seeker that she has a lot to be proud of.	labels:So it sounds like you feel like you don't measure up to your co-works because they are getting different results than you?
text:that is certainly part of it however I also feel like they have more experience than me so maybe I'm just putting too much pressure on myself? The seeker feels lonely and stressed, and wants to talk to someone who can listen and understand her situation. The supporter could tell the seeker about her own situation to make her understand her situation better.	labels:I would completely agree with that statement you are much newer than your co-workers. I believe you that you are very committed to your job. I am sure that with time you will get the same results as them if not better! Are there any co-workers you feel close to or see a friendship developing with?
text:that's nice of you to say but I also don't feel as organised. I suppose that's to be understood in a new job scenario.. Yes there are a few really nice co-workers. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to have a break and go on a short vacation or something to get away from the situation.	labels:Of course! With time you will get the hang of it. Well thats good to hear! Maybe you could ask one of them to coffee and express how you are feeling. I would bet that they felt the same when they started..
text:I think what I do is so complicated I sometimes wonder if I've been off more than I can chew. is this something you can relate to? The seeker feels she has been off more than she expected. The supporter tells the seeker that she has been off more than she expected at the beginning of her new job.	labels:That certainly is something I can relate. There was a period of time in school where i signed up for way too many classes and had to drop out of a few. If you feel like you are in over your head it is ok to take a step back. It is important that you take care of your self and know your limits. :)
text:I suppose it's difficult to know when something is too much for you or if you need to give it more time.. The seeker feels lonely and worried about the fact that her boyfriend had an affair and she was the one who found out. The supporter should respond to the seeker's emotion first.	labels:I would say if you are showing signs for several weeks of being overwhelmed (tired, stressed, snappy etc.) That is probably is too much.
text:Thankshe problem is I've worked really hard to get a better position and if I wasn't successful and feel like a failure. maybe I should look at it like this job just isn't for me if, like you say, I can't seem to get on after several weeks. The seeker feels she can't measure up to her co-workers. The supporter can tell the seeker that there is no need to compare herself to others. The supporter can help the seeker realize she is doing a good job.	labels:I would say thats the right option if this persists. I am sure there are other jobs that would fit you well!
text:Yes I suppose that is true actually. Just because I'm not good at this job, doesn't mean I wouldn't be great others. I suppose it's best to give it a go and see at least then you can say you tried. have you ever put too much pressure on yourself? The seeker feels lonely and feels like she has to carry around too much pressure. The supporter should not say anything about how busy the seeker is. The supporter should focus on making sure the seeker feels better.	labels:Yes i have and it did not end well I burned out and couldn't do my job at all..
text:Ah, so you have suffered with a similar situation. it is comforting to know the others face similar challenges and it's not just me. The seeker and supporter have found a common ground. This conversation is quite easy and can be done in a few minutes.	labels:Of course you are not alone!
text:I think I'll give this a good few weeks and ask myself how I think I'm doing then go from there. Thanks for the chat and your suggestions. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could tell the seeker that the supporter has a lot of people that care about the seeker.	labels:I think that is a great idea I wish you luck! Remember no matter what you will find somewhere you belong!	episode_done:True
text:Hi. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that she does not have to be lonely.	labels:hello, how are you?
text:Honestly I'm not doing too great. hbu. The seeker feels lonely and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could ask the seeker the problems with her boyfriend that make her feel lonely. The supporter could also ask the seeker if she could think of things that make her feel happy, like her nephew.	labels:I'm doing ok, Is there anything you would like to chat about?
text:Yeah my long time partner cheated on me recently and I just found out. I havent been able to see them in awhile because of lock down and now they tell me this :( The seeker feels lonely and feels like she is the one being unfaithful, which is not true. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is a great person and her boyfriend is a jerk.	labels:That is horrible I am so sorry they done that to you.
text:thanks. its just been such a hard couple of months because of the virus. And now with this I just dont know what to do. The seeker is feeling lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to think of something to make her feel better.	labels:I have been cheated on in the past and it always messes with your mind just know it is nothing to do with you it is all them, yes this virus is horrible on everyone it took us all by surprise at how bad it is.
text:Yeah its an awful feeling and I just feel really sad. The seeker feels sad and she doesn't know what to do about it. The supporter could help her by saying that she is not a bad person. The supporter should also suggest that she think of the positive things in her life.	labels:I know it's heartbreaking, have you reached out to a friend or family member sometimes opening up to someone close is the best way to let every feeling out.
text:I haven't spoken to anyone yet I dont want to bother anyone. The seeker is feeling lonely and lost with the breakup of her boyfriend. The supporter could encourage the seeker to reach out to a friend or family member to talk about their feelings.	labels:don't ever think you are a bother to anyone. You are loved by those close to you and I am sure they would be great comfort during this.
text:Yeah I guess I should talk to someone about it. what else do you think I should do? The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is loved by a friend and family member and she should go and talk to one of them.	labels:When I got cheated on by my ex, I took time to build my self confidence up, build my happiness up, I wrote a letter telling him how it hurt and every feeling and then I ripped it up and threw it away it felt good getting my feelings out. it might help you to.
text:Yeah maybe I should try that. What else do you think would help? The seeker feels sad and lonely. The supporter could offer a few suggestions.	labels:letting them go is the major one you don't ever want to be with someone who cheats on you if they do it once and you forgive them they 9 times out of 10 will do it again.
text:Yeah I definitely will not be going back to them. They've hurt me too much and I wont be able to trust them again. The seeker feels lonely and sad. The supporter could help the seeker by listening to the seeker and expressing how lonely she feels. The supporter could also ask the seeker if she has any friends she could talk to if she needs to.	labels:exactly and once they break your trust it can't ever be fully repaired again you will always have that doubt in your mind about them.
text:yeah. thanks for sharing your experience with me. I feel a little better now :) The seeker feels lonely, sad and depressed. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her family, friends and even God, and ask God to comfort her during this.	labels:you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you. you are very welcome I hope everything gets better for you. And that once your heart is healed you find someone who truly loves you and doesn't do that to you.
text:Thank you :) Thank you for spending the time to chat with me I hope you have a great day. The seeker feels lonely and sad because of the recent news. The supporter should ask the seeker to talk about something positive to alleviate the negative feelings.	labels:Anytime, I hope you have a great day as well.	episode_done:True
text:Hi there. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker to talk to her boyfriend about how she feels and see if they can work on it together.	labels:Hello.  How's it going?
text:I've not been doing great to be honest. I'm finding it hard to stay positive with all these constant lockdowns and restrictions. The seeker is feeling gloomy and feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the positive things in her life.	labels:I can agree.  There are so many places going back to where we were several months ago.  Which state do you live in?
text:I'm actually from the UK. I live in the North of the country near Manchester and things are bad here right now. The seeker is sad about the restrictions and the lockdown. The supporter could ask more information about the seeker's place and the lockdown.	labels:I agree it's bad!  Where I live in the US our numbers are going back up and the kids are being home schooled again.  I just keep thinking this is temporary! .
text:Yes I suppose it does help to think it possible not for the long term but my friends seem to be dealing with it better than I am and I'm not quite sure why it's put me in such a sad emotional state. I should just get on with it but have very low motivation. The seeker is feeling lonely and worried. The supporter could tell the seeker he has people around him to make him feel loved.	labels:I have to say it's hard to find motivation and I was in that spot at the beginning.  With news of vaccines being introduced here shortly, that's what's keeping me afloat.  Are you able to hang out with friends?
text:no not really because I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household. I could potentially try and meet them virtually online or on a video call is this something you've had much experience with? The seeker is feeling isolated and lonely because she is not allowed to mix with friends. The supporter can encourage the seeker to find ways to meet people.	labels:Oh very much so!  Zoom and Facetime are my best friends right now.  lol I think that's one of the reasons why I snapped out of my depression is because I started doing that more since we couldn't go out and do anything.
text:Ok that's interesting so you have also suffered with depression in the past? exactly how did you get out of it yourself? The seeker feels stressed and lonely and she mentions that she cannot talk to her friends and family. The supporter could ask for clarification of the statement, "I'm not supposed to mix with people outside of my household." The supporter could ask more about the seeker's situation and what is keeping her down.	labels:I downloaded Zoom around the end of May.  The first two months were the worst. I had never heard of Zoom until a friend said we should have a virtual party so he organized it and there were 11 on the call.  It was so much fun despite the fact. Maybe organizing a "zoom party" would start to lift your spirits.
text:that's a really good suggestion. I could also catch up with friends that haven't seen for a while. I think this would definitely work to boost my mood. The only problem is being depressed isn't something that I'm familiar with. what if it goes a little bit deeper than this? The seeker is feeling sad and lonely. The supporter should ask the seeker for more details about what is bothering her.	labels:Depression sucks I have to say!  Just don't let it win.  Since you say it's something you have never dealt with, you can fight it by staying upbeat and do something fun.
text:Sure, or something conversations like this help perhaps a support group would be a good idea also? The seeker is sad, lonely, and worried. The supporter advises the seeker to stay up to date with the news. The supporter could also suggest that the seeker start learning about depression.	labels:Start off by not being hard on yourself for feeling the way you do.  Music, tv and books does it for me - and zoom. Most definitely.  Do you have Meetup over there?
text:I've never heard of this, what is it? The seeker is feeling lonely and sad and the supporter can help her get through this by motivating her to keep a positive mindset and continue to work on her mood.	labels:It's an app on mobile devices where you can (when there's no pandemic) meet up with folks who share common interests as yourself.  Nowadays instead of meeting in person, they are doing virtual meetups.  I do it with a book club.
text:I think something to take my mind off the current situation would be really good. I like the idea of a virtual book club. is it free? The seeker feels lonely, stressed and has no motivation. The supporter could ask the seeker what she thinks would be a way to boost her mood but the conversation isn't going in that direction.	labels:Totally free!
text:I like the sound of that, thanks for your help. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend.	labels:You are so welcome.  Just don't let that depression get the best of you.  You're stronger than it is.
text:thank you for the vote of confidence. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could offer a distraction by talking about the positive side of not being able to go out for a while and work on self-care.	labels:Very welcome!	episode_done:True
text:hello how are you today?\nHi there. I'm OK but have had a difficult time at work recently. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:i am sorry to hear that, would you like to talk about it?
text:Yes I have been given what I can only describe as ridiculous feedback by my manager and it had annoyed me greatly. I'm thinking about complaining about it. The seeker feels annoyed, but the reason for that is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:It is always hard to hear any bad feedback, do you feel that you could speak with your manager about it and try to resolve the feelings?
text:I could do but this seems to be something that she has an issue with and I wouldn't want it to damage our working relationship. She basically said she doesn't like the way I sit in meetings and smile when I'm thinking about something? The seeker does not feel lonely, but the supporter should continue to ask for more details.	labels:Could you possibly go to her and tell her that you have heard the feed back and you are sorry to hear that it bothers her that you did not realize it and it is something you will work on becoming more aware of. You seem like such a nice person i am sure if you approached it the right way you would not cause any damage.
text:I'm thinking perhaps I should go to a different manager and voice these concerns. I don't see how I sit in meetings or how I smile when I'm thinking to be constructive work based feedback it's really frustrating it's clear this person just doesn't like me. The seeker feels frustrated but the supporter could explain how the manager may be feeling. The supporter could try to give the seeker a more positive outlook and explain how the seeker can resolve the problem.	labels:Going to another manager may be a great idea! Maybe the manager could address the issue with her and help her to realize there is nothing wrong with a having happy employee like yourself.
text:yeah that's true I mean I'm almost thinking this manager needs to be retrained because this video isn't work related is really quite petty an actually makes me consider not working for her in future. The only problem is I need my job I need a steady income but this person just seems to have it out for me. The seeker feels lonely and upset. After hearing the supporter's suggestions, the seeker feel better.	labels:Yes i can see where that would be a problem.
text:perhaps I'm just making too much of a big deal about this. how would you react if someone gave you similar feedback in work? The seeker feels lonely because she has to work with someone who is petty and makes her feel singled out. The supporter should ask the seeker what she can do to change the way she feels at work.	labels:Do you think you could speak to this other manager about possibly transferring positions so you are not working under your current manager?
text:I haven't actually thought about that as a solution but that might work actually. I think maybe I'm overthinking this but I've taken it very personally. The seeker feels very lonely and stressed out. The supporter could help the seeker by talking about the things she could do to feel less lonely and stressed.	labels:Well you have a right to feel how you do, everyone takes things differently. It would bother me but i would proably try to get to know her better to see why she has such a problem with others being happy, maybe she has some problems going on in her life and has no one to share these problems with if she is not happy it may come as a struggle to see others happy all the time.
text:I think that's an interesting perspective. she might have issues herself and be taking them out on members of her team in work which is quite sad really. Do you think I should just be blunt and ask her the question? The seeker feels lonely and stressed, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:I would let her know nicely that some things she said has been hurtful and ask if there is anything on her mind that she would like to chat about that you would be glad to talk with her.
text:so be supportive but also make it clear that what she has said has had an impact on me? The seeker is not only angry but also has a desire to hurt the supporter. The supporter should have encouraged the seeker to calm down and think about what happened. The supporter could have asked the seeker why she is upset.	labels:Yes you are such a positive person that i think you being supportive will help open up communication, and yes you should make it known that she has said something that has affected you personally and in addressing it may help her not treat others that way in the future.
text:ok great I'll definitely try that and try and put this advice into practice. The seeker feels stressed out and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a lot of people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:In the mean time try to not take it personally you really seem like a nice person so i dont think she meant to cause you any harm.	episode_done:True
text:Hello :) The seeker feels lonely because she is away from her loved ones. The supporter could tell the seeker that she is feeling lonely because she is missing the people she loves.	labels:Hello how are you doing today?
text:I'm doing well how bout yourself? The seeker is feeling lonely and doesn't know what to do. The supporter could suggest the seeker to think about finding a good friend to talk to, or to try to find a good book that can help her to feel better.	labels:I am also doing well, thank you for asking! :) What did you come here to talk about?
text:I've just been feeling down about school the last couple of months. I havent been doing as well since covid. and I'm kind of upset at my self for it. The seeker feels depressed and worries about her school performance. The supporter could ask how the seeker feels and offer some suggestions for him to help her to feel better.	labels:Oh I see. Yeah these times right now are really difficult to feel motivated and get things done, especially when a lot of school is online.
text:Yeah the online schooling is tough for me. I cant seem to be motivated and I really miss seeing all my buddies at school. I haven't seen anyone in person other than my family since march :( The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could ask for some advice about how she can make her mind think about a positive thing.	labels:I get that 100%. It's also been really hard on me to not be able to see the people I'm close too. I don't live with family anymore, so I haven't seen my family for months either. So I understand where you are coming from. But you shouldn't feel upset at yourself for how you are feeling. It is completely normal, and I'm sure all your friends are feeling the same way! I have a few things I would like to share with you about how I have been getting through it. Maybe it will help you out :)
text:the virus has been hard on everyone hasnt it. sure thing :) share. The seeker feels lonely, and the supporter is giving helpful advice to her.	labels:Usually I find myself just cooped up inside my room doing the same routine over and over again. That can put us into depressive, unmotivated moods. The thing that started helping me the most, was changing that routine even a little bit. If I feel unmotivated, I like to change my surroundings! Usually for me, that means moving to the living room, or to the back porch. As silly as that sounds, it really helps to switch up where you are trying to get things done. It's also really helpful to try and do new things if you are feeling unmotivated. Obviously that is difficult right now, but there are definitely things you can try! Like going on walks outside, or trying new little hobbies. I personally have tried out drawing and typing to help distract me when I am feeling overwhelmed.
text:You bring up a good point about changing environment. I feel like everyday is the same day samething over and over that might be why I'm feeling so down. Plus i work in the basement so I dont get much sunlight. Maybe I'll try moving to the living room :) I've picked up a couple hobbies and they definitely help keep me busy but with school and all I find I dont have a lot of time for them. The seeker feels stressed and depressed. The supporter could mention the seeker is feeling lonely and it is okay to feel down, and that it is normal to feel that way. The supporter could also share their experiences of getting through times of loneliness or stress.	labels:Oh yeah that probably is taking a bit toll on you working in the basement. I definitely suggest moving to the living room every now and then just to feel that small change. :) You could also plan out your days if it would help! Try and find time for the things that will bring you joy, whether that involves waking up earlier, or moving some routine things around.
text:Yeah maybe I should do that. The seeker feels lonely and depressed. The supporter could help the seeker by being more positive and encouraging.	labels:And I can tell you really do miss your friends, so it's super important to make time to talk to them too!
text:gotta switch things up. Yeah I should chat with my friends more too. Its hard to fine time but I should try. The seeker feels lonely and depressed because the supporter was giving her a lot of help and attention. The supporter should ask the seeker more questions to understand the seeker's situation better, and give more help.	labels:It is definitely hard, but it's important for your mental health to keep the people you love close to you :)
text:very very true especially in these difficult times. Im hoping they get the vaccine developed asap. and everythiung can go back to normal. The seeker wants to change her routine. The supporter should help her to change her routine by suggesting new things to do.	labels:Yes exactly. And yeah that will be so nice when we are finally able to leave again and feel normal. But unfortunately we can't wait around for that since it's so up in the air recently. So I'm glad that you are wanting to change little things in your life to keep you happy until then.
text:Yeah thank you for your advice ill try implementing them in my life more. I feel much better now :) thank you for your time. The seeker is feeling lonely, and the supporter's advice has helped her a little.	labels:Of course! I had a good time chatting with you! Thank you as well :)	episode_done:True
text:Hello. Are you there? The seeker is not sure whether the supporter is actually there.	labels:goodness  i am so sorry! my browser did not make a noise. how are you doing? sorry i kept you waiting!
text:That is okay! I'm glad you're here. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Awww, thanks. How are things going in your world today?
text:I'm doing alright I suppose, just trying to do a few mturk tasks to feel like I'm accomplishing something. Waiting to hear back from unemployment and not hearing back from any job applications makes it hard to ever really relax. The seeker feels lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on her nephew and how she smiles when she sees him.	labels:Ah, i hear you. The lack of response makes it really easy for me to make up stories in my head and fear the worst.
text:I've never done any computer based jobs before, I did live audio and carpentry before this, so I just feel like I don't qualify for anything, but I'm immune compromised so until this is over i don't know what other work I can safely do besides for something from my computer.... I just feel so terribly stuck. The seeker feels so lonely. The supporter should ask the seeker if he has any friends who could help him to feel loved.	labels:I'm sorry. I know the feeling of not knowing where I fit in. Its a whole world shift, too.
text:I haven't received any financial assistance from the government yet, I've been living off of loans from friends and what little of my art I've been able to sell. It's stressful. I just want my life back. I felt like I was on a really good career path at the first of the year, and now I just don't even know what o do. The seeker is feeling worried, since she is not receiving any financial help. The supporter could say that she is doing well and the seeker can be at peace.	labels:That scattered feeling....trying to put the pieces back together....I've walked the same road this year. Would you be willing to mourn for what you had before? To let it go?
text:I don't want to. If there is a vaccine in the first quarter of 2021 then the company I worked for before this will be able to go back to business, and I've been assured my old job back. I'm just in limbo right now, figuring out how to survive until then and keep from going crazy. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter could notice the seeker is having a hard time with the situation and she is lonely. The supporter should try comforting the seeker and ask for more information.	labels:you have determination! There is fire within! Tell me, what brings you joy?
text:Music (that's why I was in the music industry before this haha) and art. I paint and do woodburning. I also love my cats, they spark a lot of joy. Thank you for chatting with me, and helping me earn the maximum bonus for this task! I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day! Good luck in your own endeavors.. The seeker feels stressed and anxious. The supporter should ask for more details of the seeker's situation.	labels:but of course! it was a pleasure to connect. keep chasing joy daily!
text:oh, I think you need a couple more inputs on your end to finish. The seeker feels like she has a lot on her mind and is really stressed. The supporter should ask the seeker what is the reason behind feeling stressed.	labels:oh good, well i got inputs to put!
text:Perhaps you could tell me what brings you joy? The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter might tell the seeker to go out for a walk and take a walk outside.	labels:YES! for one, this mturk task is AMAZING  to me. Connection has been a huge boon for me this year. I thrive on helping others realize their strengths.
text:I'm glad you're enjoying it, I like this task too. The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter tells the seeker that she has people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:between that and creation, i love to express myself. art, movement, building something.....its all just me expressing myself, getting my head into the world.
text:That is beautiful! Keep it up! The seeker feels lonely and wants to feel more connected to others. The supporter could remind the seeker that there are people around her to help. The supporter could also tell the seeker about the other person who is having a difficult time with their life. The supporter could also tell the seeker that their own situation is difficult but they can help the seeker.	labels:whenever i can :)	episode_done:True
text:Hello how are you doing today?\nIm not doing very good. The seeker is feeling lonely and wants to talk to someone. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved. "Hello, how are you doing today? 	labels:I'm so sorry to hear that, but I would love to help. What is going on?
text:My boyfriend broke up with me because we kept fighting and now I have no money and no place to stay. The seeker feels lonely and has no money. The supporter should empathize and explain the reason of the situation.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. breakups are definitely hard to go through, especially in the times we are in right now. How long were you guys together? And you were living together?
text:We were together for almost 5 years and we were living together he had all the money in his name and I have nothing now. The seeker feels sad and lonely. She wants to stay in her relationship and find a solution. The supporter should empathize with her and ask her questions to know more about her situation.	labels:Oh I see that was a very long relationship! I actually just got out of a 3 1/2 year one myself, so I understand how hard it is. Are you still currently staying with him until you find your own place? Or are you staying somewhere else?
text:I am currently trying to find a way to get to my mom who lives about 150 miles away. Im staying with my friend for now but she said I can only stay for 2 more days. Yeah break ups are the worst. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could suggest the seeker to think of positive things, and try to do that instead of focusing on the bad things.	labels:I'm glad to hear that you are with a friend right now during this hard time, and that you have a place to go! But I see the struggle is finding a way to get there.
text:Yeah she is a good friend im happy that I can stay with her for the time being its just stressful trying to get to my mom. The seeker feels lonely, worried, stressed and sad.	labels:If you are struggling on finding a way back to your moms house, it might be a good idea to loan or borrow some money from either friends or family, or open a credit card just for the time being. Then once you get back to your mom's, you can start focusing on yourself and get yourself back on your feet! IT's important to not overwhelm yourself right now, so focus on one thing at a time.
text:Yeah I definitely agree. I am waiting to hear back from capitalone about getting approved for a credit card and my friend said she can loan me 70$ but the bus ticket to my mom is 150$ so I'm almost to my goal I'm working on it though. It does make me feel better to talk about it though and lay it all out it makes it easier to figure my stuff out. The seeker feels lonely and she is worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker that it is okay to feel lonely and she can talk to her friends and family.	labels:That is great to hear! I know that you are probably also hurting from the breakup itself too, but I'm glad to hear that you are focusing on getting yourself to a safe place first. It's going to take a long time to fully heal again, but as long as you make sure you are stable, you will be able to get through this. It also sounds like you know what you need to do, and you aren't letting yourself forget what is important. That is wonderful.
text:Yeah thanks I appreciate that. I feel a lot better I hope you have an awesome day! I do understand what I need to do for sure. It was just overwhelming thinking about everything and talking it and listing it out makes me feel better for sure. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could help by telling the seeker that there are people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:Yeah that's great. I have confidence that you will get over this bump in your life, and good things will come to you. Keep focusing on what you need to do! You are doing great!.	episode_done:True
text:hello. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:Hi there! How may I support you today?
text:im just feeling anxious about my job future. A lot of my colleagues are having trouble getting their licenses because of covid. which means we wont be able to work. The seeker feels anxious and has a fear of losing her job. The supporter should focus on the situation to help the seeker feel better.	labels:That must be hard. COVID has really turned our world upside down! What type of occupation are you in?
text:I'm studying to be a pharmacist. Really scared of getting sick too since I have to work in hosptials and such. The seeker is worried about the impact of COVID on her job and her future. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:That's great! It is because of front-line workers and people like you that we are at least able to put a fight against the pandemic! My hat tip to you for choosing your line of profession. Major pharma companies have already announced vaccines and they have a success rate of more than 90 -95%. So my friend, this too shall pass..
text:Yeah  I've been reading those research articles recently they look promising. I'm hoping the vaccines get developed early next year and everything can go back to normal. The seeker feels lonely and anxious about her future. The supporter could ask about the seeker's job situation and the kind of job that she is doing. The supporter could encourage the seeker to be positive and do something to support herself.	labels:I feel the same way too! Modern technology is indistinguishable from magic!. So hang in there, with the US election results and the vaccine announcement, things will surely get better..
text:Yeah it's looking like things will improve. The seeker is anxious about her job future. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are other people around her to make her feel loved.	labels:If you are in North America, the pandemic rate will go high due to combination with flu season, but at the end of the day, we will develop herd immunity.
text:Yeah not looking forward to flu season. I wish people would just stop throwing parties and getting everyone sick. The seeker feels anxious because of the situation of work in the hospital and her fear of getting sick. The supporter should show the seeker how to calm down and feel more confident.	labels:Well, nobody is, my friend! But it's part of life. And ya, morons will exist all over the world. Since you are young, even if you contract, you will recover pretty easily. But, God forbid, if you do, please practice social distancing and stay home!
text::( yeah they do don't they. Yeah i'll definitely keep my self isolated if im sick. im worried about all my  friends too because all of us will be out working in hospitals soon. The seeker is feeling worried about the future of their job. They are feeling lonely and worried about their friends. The supporter could give the seeker some encouragement and a hope.	labels:I hope you don't get sick. Just follow what your supervisors advise you to and apply your own knowledge into practice. I am sure it will work out great for you and your friends! Friends make life worth living and I am sure you all will do great. Good luck!
text:thanks :) I'll try to take care of my self hopefully I end up helping a person or two. The seeker feels lonely and worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:That's the spirit!. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
text:No I think this has been a very productive conversation thank you for your time :) The seeker feels stressed. The supporter could tell the seeker that she can have fun with her friends.	labels:Sure! Take care :)	episode_done:True
text:Hey, how are you doing?\nNot the best, but I'm surviving. hello? The seeker feels lonely and has no idea the supporter is right there. The supporter should be patient and wait for the right time to talk to her.	labels:By surviving, it is more of a personal situation or an outside dilemma affecting you. is it*
text:I just haven't been able to find any work. I guess that is an outside dilemma, but being this behind on bills and feeling this helpless to change my situation has negatively impacted my mood. The seeker feels helpless and hopeless about finding work and the supporter should ask them about what are the situations they are facing. The supporter could tell the seeker to focus on the positive things in their life to make them feel better.	labels:I see what you mean. Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.
text:I have already been budgeting extensively, the issue is I can't make enough to cover my basic expenses, no matter how much I cut them. The seeker feels helpless and stressed over her financial situation. The supporter should ask her why she has not been able to find work.	labels:Are you also pressed for time? Time management can be a predicament as well.
text:I have lots of free time, just waiting for unemployment to respond to my claims, applying for jobs online, and trying services like mturk to earn what I can from home in the meantime.. I spend a good portion of my day trying to apply for everything I can and fixating on mturk tasks to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something. The seeker is still worried and feels helpless. The supporter could say something like "you are not alone", "it will get better", "there is hope", or "you have been through worse".	labels:Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar. For someone who is also not in the best place financially and just making the bare minimum, it can feel hopeless sometimes. I know you are feeling stressed at the moment, but I've realized focusing on the long term helps ease the pressure of current stressors.
text:I get to a point in my day where it feels like I've done everything I can for that day, and then I just have to try not to get too stir crazy. The seeker feels alone, helpless and lost. In addition, she feels frustrated with her financial situation. The supporter could help the seeker to see what she can do to change the situation.	labels:I feel that if you can focus on using your extra time as an investment into yourself (whether by reading, picking up a hobby, or working out), you can feel more accomplished and at ease with what you are doing in life.
text:I've been trying to look ahead, but this year has already set me back so much from my intended career path that it's frustrating. I just want my life back. That is good advice. I have been doing a lot more art during this time. The seeker is feeling stressed. The supporter could ask if the seeker is having a hard time and if the seeker is okay with the situation.	labels:Being progressive is difficult, but is one of the things in life which compound very easily. I believe many aspects in life are connected and that improving in some parts improves you as a whole.
text:Some days it's tempting to just do nothing and wait for it all to be over, but I feel better when I accomplish something for the day. The seeker feels stressed about her bills, but she also thinks the supporter has good advice. The supporter could ask the seeker if she is feeling lonely by using the first person. It is more effective to help a seeker express his/her emotions than to tell him/her what to feel.	labels:And if these "improvements" can also make you money/increase your worth/ease your mind, then that can be called a success. In my opinion atleast..
text:I wish someone was interested in buying my art! That would be a huge confidence boost. The seeker is thinking about her boyfriend, but the supporter should ask more about the situation.	labels:Yeah, but imagine how it would if you had days like that knowing it isn't a bad thing to relax. You have already put in the work in being comfortable before, allowing to enjoy your time however way you wanted. Looks like you already have an interest which can help you in many ways in life. That's really good.
text:yes, I miss being able to actually relax. When you are financially behind it feels like everything is just making it worse. thank you for chatting with me and helping me earn the bonus for this task! The seeker feels lonely, stressed and that she doesn't know how to fix this. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has a good head on her shoulders and that she is a strong person. The supporter could also give the seeker some conversation tips.	labels:Yes, the tension and pressure only seems to mount on, but there will always be things like that in life. It is important to remember whether such problems are in your control or not. If they are, you know for sure that you can change how you are presently. No problem, this is a very interesting experience for me too.	episode_done:True
text:hello!!\nI am very depressed. I found out that my girlfriend is cheating on me with my friend! The seeker feels lonely and depressed.	labels:that's really bad. even I was also in the same situation.
text:I have been with her for close to 2 years and now she has been cheating me right under my nose for the past few months! how foolish of me to blindly trust her... How did you deal with it? The seeker feels she is in a difficult situation and the supporter could provide the seeker with some ways to deal with the situation.	labels:To be honest i was not completely came out it since it was 3 years but now i somehow getting better i tried to divert myself from the thoughts engage myself with other friends spend more time with my family like that. try to divert yourself, keep yourself busy, spend more time with family, try to minimize the usage of mobile.
text:But my family is away from me in another country. I can't even go back due to this stupid covid! I feel betrayed and like dying. The seeker is feeling depressed and lonely. The supporter could tell the seeker some ways to make her feel better.	labels:yeah I could understand your feelings right now.
text:I actually broke my phone in anger and damaged her credit card. I feel like slapping both of them so hard that they forget where they came from! but I can't do anything . I am helpless. The seeker feels betrayed and like dying. The supporter should say about the seeker's situation and should express sympathies to the seeker	labels: yeah its really hard to handle this state of mind but we need to.
text:Why are girls like this? The seeker feels betrayed, like dying. Her supporter should tell her to relax and have faith.	labels:I don't know but some girls were playing with a guys intense feelings.
text:I know, right! Should I move on or should I take revenge? The seeker is feeling very angry and sad. The supporter can suggest some activities for the seeker to divert her mind from the situation.	labels:I think the best way is to move on.
text:I feel like giving it back to her though! but I may get into trouble ... ya you are right! She is going downhill anyway. my friend just got fired and I actually got a much better job! The seeker feels betrayed by his girlfriend but the supporter doesn't give a solution. The supporter should tell the seeker that a good solution is to think of the best things in the relationship, and focus on those instead.	labels:make her feel like without her your life will be better.
text:That's what I will do. I will live better in front of her and my back stabbing friend. The seeker feels betrayed and angry. The supporter would tell the seeker there are people around her to help.	labels:revenge her with your success and positive attitude in front of she you need to much more happy.
text:Sure! You got it mate :) thanks for the support. Got a job and life in front of me. Bye now. The seeker feels sad, disappointed, betrayed and betrayed. The supporter helps the seeker to realize that she can have time to think about what has happened.	labels:that's great!! happy beginning of new life.	episode_done:True
text:Hi, I have been feeling a bit down lately. My levels of stress and concern have been higher since the pandemic began. The seeker feels lonely, but not worried. The supporter should ask more questions to the seeker.	labels:Sorry you have been feeling down. What are some strategies you have tried to help you cope?
text:Well, I have tried to get my mind off of it by activities at home. Spending time with my family. The seeker feels lonely and wants to get away. The supporter can talk to the seeker about the stress she may be feeling and how she can get her mind off of it.	labels:Those sound like positive ways of handling stress. It is natural of course to feel stressed out by the pandemic so it can be useful to think of ways to help manage that stress.
text:Yes, but I still seem to struggle with feeling a bit more down than I'd like. Not sure what to do. The seeker is struggling to cope with stress. The supporter could ask for more information about the stress.	labels:Have you tried meditation and/or deep breathing exercises? I know I find that helpful when I am worrying.
text:I have tried meditation before, but quite a bit back. Do you have any activities you could recommend, without risking my health? Maybe in my own home, so that I can social distance. The seeker feels lonely, stressed, and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should tell the seeker she has someone to lean on. They can also tell the seeker to meditate and to try deep breathing exercises.	labels:One exercise I find helpful is lying on my back with a pillow under my head. I keep my legs bent and put a pillow under my knees for support. I then put one hand on my chest and one on my diaphram and slowly breathe through my nose feeling my stomach press against my hand. I then exhale slowly through my nose and repeat for about 10 minutes. It can be very calming.
text:Okay, I will give that a try. I don't feel I'm at a level that I need therapy or medication, so this might be a good way to calm my nerves when I am feeling apprehensive or stressed out. The seeker feels stressed because of the pandemic. The supporter might also tell the seeker that the supporter is sorry she feels stressed.	labels:Good, I hope that helps. I would also trying to reach out to others who are experiencing the same. It is harder nowadays with covid but there are many online groups. You could even start your own group!
text:Yes, I do find that there are times when I am on a social media outlet that it does seem to make me feel better. I can feel humor. But, it can be a bit depressing too. Maybe I should block the ones that have mostly negative posts? The seeker feels lonely and down and that she doesn't know what to do. The supporter helps her understand that there are times to be alone. The supporter shares her own experiences of meditation and deep breathing exercises. The supporter encourages the seeker to try this, too. The supporter gives the seeker suggestions on how to make this exercise work for her.	labels:I hear you on that. Sometimes social media can also be negative. I think that blocking negative posts is a great idea. It is a way of taking control.
text:I wished I had some more ideas on some fun, interesting or things to fill my time at home. I often feel I get in a bit of a rut with the same thing. Since we are home more now. The seeker is feeling anxious and depressed. The supporter should ask the seeker what she is anxious about, and the reason for being depressed.	labels:Are there any hobbies that you have been interested in but never had the time for? Or perhaps hobbies that you used to do but have not tried in awhile?
text:Well, I used to read quite a bit more, but I have slowed down on it. Maybe I should go and grab a few books. Thanks for the idea! The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter is able to suggest a way to increase her social activities. The supporter could also suggest some activities that is fun and interesting.	labels:You are quite welcome. I too find reading to be a most welcome escape. It takes one's mind off of day to day worries.
text:Yes, let's us escape to another world. I'm glad you got my mind on that. I feel better! The seeker feels lonely and worried about her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:Perhaps you could look into book groups as well. There are probably quite a few online these days. Glad I could be helpful!
text:I will do that! Thanks again. The seeker feels lonely, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter can help the seeker feel the support of others.	labels:You are welcome. I am glad I could help you find some ways to help manage stress levels. Is there anything else you want to talk about?	episode_done:True
text:Hi good afternoon, I am seeking support for my anxiety related to my job. Is this something you can help me with? The seeker wants to know if the supporter can help her with her anxiety. She also wants the supporter to understand her anxiety has nothing to do with her job. The supporter should ask if the seeker would like an individual session or if she wants to try to work through her anxiety in a group.	labels:Hey there, please do share! I would love to help! Why is your job causing you to have anxiety?
text:Wonderful! My job is causing me some stress and anxiety. Everything is usually good except for my one coworker who tries to boss me around. She is very unhelpful and hypocritical. You cannot even talk to her without her interrupting or being rude. I am trying to find a better way to deal with the situation. The seeker tries to talk to her coworker directly. The supporter could also talk to her supporter about the situation and how to help resolve the issue.	labels:I see, so you have difficulty dealing with a co-worker. Let ask, Is there anyway of talking to her about her behavior? Also does she behave this way with others?
text:Yes, I believe she has an aggressive personality and there wouldn't be much of a difference in the way she acts or speaks to others. She never listens. I could try to have a conversation but in the past it has been difficult. The seeker feels lonely.	labels:What I do recommend is contacting a mediator or someone from HR and having a sit down. Since clearly this is affecting you at work and outside of it. Talking to HR should help.. What do you think?
text:That is a good recommendation, I have tried to relax and relieve stress in other outlets and not let it get to me or take it personally. Our office is small so it would likely just be my boss who I have mentioned it to before. I think of it as she may not be working here that much longer. and is only part time now. The seeker feels stressed and anxious and the supporter tries to help the seeker relax.	labels:Honestly don't let it stress you out, don't bring issues at work back home. I also recommend finding ways to destress, listening to music, lightning candles or starting a series on netflix.
text:Thats true, it is good to put it in that perspective and to have another opinion on the subject. And think of another way to handle everything. The seeker feels lonely and stressed. The supporter could focus on the seeker's problem and give helpful suggestions.	labels:Glad to help!
text:Thank you very much! The seeker feels anxious about her work. Her friend is trying to help her relax.	labels:No problem, I hope enjoy the rest of your day!
text:Thank you and same to you. I appreciate your support! What do you do to unwind after a stressful day. The seeker feels lonely and stressed at work. The supporter could ask about the seeker's current situation and how to destress.	labels:Personally, I spend time with family. Then I have a can of seltzer, watch something on netflix and unwind.
text:Netflix and seltzer have solved many of my problems. The seeker can feel happy, but she also feels stressed. 	labels:Haha it's a winning combination. Maybe a salty snack or something sweet depending how stressful the day was.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. The seeker feels lonely and scared. The supporter could tell the seeker that there are people around her to help her.	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:I'm not doing very well unfortunately. I failed my college finals, and now I'm up for Academic Probation. The seeker feels stressed and lonely. The supporter could help the seeker by encouraging her.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that, I'd love to understand more about what you are struggling with?
text:I'm almost near gradution too. The seeker tells the supporter that she is not doing well and that she is almost graduation. The supporter could ask more about the seeker's situation. If the supporter wants to talk about the seeker's situation, then the supporter should wait for the seeker to tell him or her.	labels:Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. Academic probation does seem very scary. When did you learn you failed your finals?
text:I learned yesterday. Because of the pandemic the semester is shorter. The seeker is afraid she will be expelled. The supporter should try to support her.	labels:And how long do you have until graduation?
text:I should be graduating in June. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter doesn't understand the reason. The supporter should ask more details about the reason.	labels:I see. Well it's nice that we matched up! I actually work at a college and now a couple good strategies to get off academic probation, and or avoid it! What is it you are studying?
text:You're a great resource then! I am majoring in Psychology with a minor in Biology. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter is a good resource.	labels:Oh that is awesome! So when do you find out whether or not you are on probation?
text:Likely in the next week. I registered for my classes for next semester but I think I should drop my minor. \ The seeker feels lonely and worries about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter should try to cheer him up and help him to focus on the good things in his life.	labels:Okay gotcha. Well a couple tips I can offer you: If you do end up on probation, most courses offer a probation workshop you can go through. And if you graduate in June, it should finish in time for you! And I was also going to recommend taking fewer units. As much as it sucks, you can't overwhelm yourself with work. You need to be able to have a healthy and happy life that is separate from school in order to preform your best. Dropping your minor may be what is best for not only your grades, but your mental health. I also recommend making an educational plan. Although it can seem scary and long to see your goals directly laid out in front of you, it really helps with motivation.
text:That's great advice and likely would be my best option. I will definitely do that. I feel better hearing that it's okay to drop my minor. I felt like a failure when I considered it. The seeker feels stressed, but the supporter does not know what the reason is. The supporter should ask for more details.	labels:From talking with you so far, I can tell that you are stressed about this. But I want to reassure you that your mental health should always come first. It is the most important thing you can do.
text:Yes I am very stressed. I hate taking online courses and this pandemic is wearing me out. Plus I have a 2 year old son. The seeker is worried about being on probation and the supporter should let the seeker know that she is not alone and help her to feel loved.	labels:You are definitely not a failure in the slightest! In fact, I would argue that you are the exact opposite of that. Being able to take such difficult courses in a pandemic, and raise a child shows how strong you are!
text:Thank you for saying that. It is tough, but I just want to finally finish my Bachelor's and do something positive. The seeker feels stressed and worried about her recent failure. The supporter could tell the seeker that she has people around her to support her, and that she will be okay.	labels:And you will succeed in that goal.

The supporter could tell the seeker she is here for her.	labels:Most definitely.  I'm far away from my family too so Zoom and phone calls have been great despite the long distance.

text:Good afternoon, what can I help you with today? .\nHi, I'm just wanting to talk about my sadness that happens every now and then.

But it doesn't happen all the time... only sometime and I don't know why. The seeker feels sad, but the reason is not mentioned. The supporter could ask for more details.	labels:That sounds like a really difficult situation to be in, I'm sorry to hear you're going through that. .

The supporter should be able to tell the seeker what the seeker is feeling and the reason for the feeling. The supporter should also give conversation instructions.	labels:There are a few strategies you could use to combat that.  Personally, I try to soak in as much sunlight as possible before it goes down.  Sometimes that will mean moving your work space, maybe getting up earlier to have a cup of coffee in the sunrise, maybe it's scheduling breaks into your day where you specifically get some vitamin D. . As far as the intrusive and repetitive nature of the thoughts, have you ever consulted with a therapist or other mental health professional?  Obsessive thoughts are sometimes a sign of anxiety.
text:Yeah that is good advice. I definitely need to work on getting myself up earlier in the mornings, I've just come so accustomed to my current sleep schedule. And in all honesty, I haven't tried a therapist yet... I'm scared it will be hard to open up to a stranger. The seeker having a depressed mood and experiencing some suicidal thoughts.

However, that is not the truth! The supporter can encourage the seeker to give her advice.	labels:Yes, BetterHelp is one of those I believe. TalkSpace is another one.

The seeker en to the advice offered. The supporter should encourage the seeker to talk about her emotions and thoughts.	labels:It may be helpful!  As far as I understand it's exceptionally easy to switch between therapists on that service, too.  So if the first one is not a good fit, you can try someone else. . The biggest piece of advice that I can give you is some that I've recently been enacting for myself:  When you get into the spiral, and you can't shake the nasty repeated thoughts, even if you "need" to sleep, get out of bed and move to a different room.  Change the situation up, get some tea, sparkling water, whatever you want, but change what your body is literally doing. .
text:Oh yeah! That's true! I will try it. And also try to incorporate a better sleep schedule. And that is very helpful thank you. I do live in a small apartment, but I have noticed that when I get out of bed and at least move to the couch, it is a different environment even though it wouldn't seem like it. I never thought how that would help me though. I will totally do it more often when I am slumping. The seeker epressed and lonely, but the supporter can tell that there is something else going on.

There's no shame in being able to say that you understand why someone would ask the question(whatever it may be) but that you don't have a full or even partial answer right now. . Because you're also going to get like, the hecklers and the people who want to look intelligent by asking asinine questions.

The seeker stressed, and the supporter could tell this. The supporter should suggest that the seeker find a quiet place to calm and focus her mind.	labels:Just feel confident that you have fulfilled the assignment according to the guidelines.

I know it doesn't feel it now, but likely you will be in a much better place because of the break up now. Have you talked this out with your partner?

The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter could help the seeker understand that it is OK to feel lonely and to feel frustrated with the situation. The supporter could give the seeker some conversation instructions to help her get out of the situation.	labels:I can sense your frustration, and his marriage just adds to that.

I do suspect some people at work are putting us eating lunch and taking walks together as something more.+ Doug make my sing and makes my body come alive but his presence is starting to break my heart because this situation is not going anywhere. I need help! It's not Doug's problem it's mine! I don't like his wife because if she was treating him well he wouldn't be with me. So why doesn't she just let him go? I'm starting to think if she was out the picture Doug and I could be together in a real relationship you know what I mean? The seeker feels confused. The supporter can help the seeker understand the situation and why she is feeling confused.	labels:I can hear your anguish, and I understand your frustration. It's not clear to me, though, that Doug is being honest with you or with his wife. You mentioned that Doug can't provide the emotional support that you need.

text:I don't understand. Doug's married I know that but I want what his wife has so she's not the problem. The seeker feels lonely and frustrated. The supporter could notice that the seeker is feeling lonely and frustrated.	labels:You're absolutely right. It sounds like Doug is the problem.

Are you saying I'm a Philanderer? The seeker feels frustrated with the supporter for not telling her how to get rid of her feelings for Doug.	labels:You're right. It's best to err on the side of caution when it comes to covid. But remember that Doug isn't your loved one alone. He's sharing germs with both you and his wife. Maybe a lockdown -- emotional and physical -- will help you work to find an end to this relationship. How did you spend your time before you met Doug? Perhaps you could reconnect with other friends or find a hobby to fill your time.
text:You never answered my question about ever being in this type of situation. Did your mate/husband or whatever Philalnder on you and you haven't gotten over it? Are you still with the man/woman or whatever that broke your heart and cheated on you? Why cant you get over it? Is the only advice for me you have is to eat Thanksgiving dinner alone?

I can understand your pain.
text:I'm glad you understand my pain. I've spent and know how to be by myself. What I'm asking you how do I get out being in love with someone? The seeker feels lonely and worried about breaking up with her boyfriend. The supporter could tell the seeker the there are people around her to make her feel being loved.	labels:It would be great to be able to give you an easy and pain-free solution, but I don't know that that is possible when it comes to matters of the heart. If you truly love Doug and want to be with him, you should tell him that and see how he responds. You mentioned, though, that he can't give you the emotional support you need. If you truly believe, in your heart of hearts, that Doug can't be your everything, then you already have the answer: He is not "the one." He's the one right now. And you shouldn't have to settle for that. You sound like a strong and capable woman who should be loved and respected for everything she is.
text:Okay so I eat Thanksgiving alone and I spend time alone. Okay tell me how i fill my nights alone up? How do I warm the other side of my bed which Doug fill so well. I meant he can't give me emotional support because he's married. There is so time, sex and emotional support he can give. And I don't why you assumed I am a woman because I'm not! Also, I don't think being with Doug is settling! I do however appreciate your time and effort..

The supporter can help the seeker by giving her some conversation instructions and a plan to feel better.	labels:That's a great way to approach it-- since the time has to pass anyway, you can use it to take care of yourself and move your life forward despite the "pause" of the pandemic. Have you thought about trying meditation or focused breathing to calm yourself when you feel spiraling?

I think you are on the right track to getting through this..

She was kind but she paid me much less than a normal professional would in that position, and took advantage of me.
text:yup.. i have 3 kids and i am not married. i have no beneftits. The seeker s worried about her work. The supporter could tell her that other people need her to do their work.	labels:She and her husband ran the business, but I continued to be burdened with extra responsibility, no extra money or benefits.  Eventually, the gas station down the hill from us was hiring at a hiring hourly rate than I was receiving from them.  I ended up leaving and going back to school.

text:its tough but i am on the honor role. you should go b ack to school. The seeker concerned about her kids, but the supporter doesn't want to make the seeker feel bad about leaving her current job.	labels:That's excellent.  I don't think you should take on this boss's emotions as a reason to stay with a job you're burning out on.  I think you should take the small step of looking at what's out there, and maybe having a few interviews.  You could try explaining to your boss that you need benefits for the kids.  I would be surprised if he did not understand that.. And if he does not understand that, well, you will know exactly who you work for, and that will be additional impetus to move on..
text:with us both being veterans it goes beyond a boss relationship hes like family. i feel like id be fucking over the whole nation turning my back on another veteran.

text:Thank you I have been trying to do that. Though I don't want to bother my friends too much. I've been keeping myself busy though. Most important is to stay away from my phone. haha. The seeker feels lonely, but the supporter should tell the seeker that she is not the only one that has felt like this. The supporter could tell the seeker to try to find a hobby or a friend to talk to that would help.	labels:That's good. at least you found ways to get out of the anxiety.. and social media can cause anxiety too, so staying from your phone also helps :)
text:Well it is not helping much. But I guess it will get better over time. I suppose the second I start to feel better, he'll call. haha. It always works that way, right? The seeker feels lonely and the supporter gives some suggestions on how to handle the situation.	labels:Yeah. given enough time and when things cool off, people do dwell on their behaviour and often times feel stupid for the way they act. i hope its the same case with your boyfriend as well.
