text:Hi, how are you doing?\nHi, I'm ok. How are you?	labels:Not bad, it's a peaceful night. Anything in particular you'd like to talk about?
text:That's great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing.	labels:I imagine that's very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well-being?
text:Just to make sure I'm wearing my mask, washing my hands, and social distancing. Which is not enough. There are more and more teachers getting infected and I just feel it a matter of time before it my turn. I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions.	labels:I'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control. Have you discussed these concerns with the school and explained the preexisting conditions? I get it though. It's scary for everyone at this point.
text:Yes I have explained to my principal, my team, and got a note from my Rheumatologist..	labels:It seems to me that they should take that information into consideration..
text:I feel that way too. I was told it for the best interest of the school that I am there I do not have student in my classroom but I'm forced to help out around the school with students and staff. Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can't quit because there not much to go into now.	labels:Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with?. Yeah you're right. Covid has been a mess for everyone and affected us in so many ways that e could've never prepared for.
text:I've tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered.	labels:I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying.
text:Very true. I'm going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better.	labels:Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some. At least you know you're not alone....
text:It really did help I feel a bit lighter. Thank you again.	labels:You're welcome. I wish you the best and many blessings.	episode_done:True
text:hi I need help. I'm under academic stress.	labels:What are you stressed about?
text:I am failing one of my classic. I'm worried about my scholarship.	labels:Oh, Covid is really having a negative affect on a lot of students, right now. Has school from home had anegative affect on you?
text:Yeah, I feel like I can't focus because I'm back home with my family and I just feel like there are so many distractions.	labels:It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.
text:Yeah thats really the reason I wanted to go away from college. I dont really have my own space when I'm here. People just come in and out of my room as they please in spite of how busy I am.	labels:Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries. I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh. Have you told your family about the issues your having?
text:I honestly am worried that they will be disappointed. Maybe that's crazy. I just remember how proud they were when I got this scholarship. I don't want them to blame me.	labels:OK, that makes sense. Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers.
text:Yeeah thats why im not officially failed. My teacher gave me an extention on my final. So, I'm working on it, but i just can't focus.	labels:Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself. Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.	episode_done:True
text:Hello how can I help you?\nKind of mad.	labels:May I ask the reason why you are mad?
text:My friends got me banned on Playstation. People I've known for 4 years.	labels:were their actions accidental or intentional?
text:Intentional. First it started from one person cuz my friend put me on speaker about something. and apparently I said something that made one person mad. I was on a PHONE CALL.	labels:Did you say anything offensive?
text:Kind of. My friend asked what is up and my girlfriend of course was nosey and said bad cuz my mom is harassing us. I was saying my mom has been ripping me off and keeps threatening to kick me out. So I just said. I honestly am at the point where I don't care if she is around or not. So someone reported me for some bs thing on playstation cuz they think I must be trash if I don't love my mom or something.	labels:I see.  If that is the case, create a personal meeting with you and your friends (the ones who banned you)..
text:My mom is kind of a draining person. I thought of being around because she has been going through low hemoglobin. But she keeps ruining my life. I wish I could. I don't even know  the jerk. The rest of them then did it because they don't like my girlfriend.	labels:just to clarify, are these online friends?  Have you met them in person?
text:Online friends. I only know one. the one who was on the phone with me. he just can't keep a call private for anything.	labels:and now for that one friend, does he know the other friends personally?
text:Even my nephew who plays with those jerks was avoiding me because my girlfriend. yeah... So... my girlfriend has this condition and was in a hospital for high contamination in her blood from her bad liver. So she was talking weird. and everyone was calling her annoying.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that..
text:But those insensentive morons don't care she literally almost died. Instead, everyone just keeps asking why am I with this disabled girl. Like... she is better now. She just needed to recover. People I knew for four years... going out of their way to mess with me.	labels:The best advice I can give you is to try to get your friends together on a private group call.  Then tell them that what they've heard was a complete misunderstanding.  And tell them to unban you from playstation.. However, if they do not respect your response, then they can't really be relied on as your friends.  They don't come to respect you so it is best for you to move on..
text:Yeah. I mostly tried to stay to my myself. Right now they're mad at me because they got all warnings from Sony. since they did an investigation on how everyone speaks.	labels:Nobody should demoralize another person and that is what your "online friends" are taking advantage of..
text:Even my own sister is giving me crap because my nephew almost lost thousands worth of games.	labels:Also send a report to Sony about the ban.  I believe with the proof, they can appeal the ban for you!
text:cuz of the warning... Like I can control what these people do when I'm offline. I did... they said they can't do anything. and that I can just report them. Kind of sucks but I guess I will just stick my lane. Karma already banned someone in the group. took $2000 worth of games. so that gave me a good laugh.	labels:In that case just keep reporting them. .
text:I would but that would just get my nephew banned. He still is at the point where he blames me. it's crazy4.	labels:Ah I see!  Don't get your nephew banned!
text:Yeah. He actually said he hates my guts. and remove me from authorizing his games. even though I paid for over 100 dollars of the content.	labels:how close are you to your nephew?
text:Very. Which is why I am more angry. That he is siding with people who disrespect me that much.	labels:If he's relying on your payments for the content, then I suggest for you to stop the payments until he learns his lesson..
text:Well my friend just said it's my fault for buying ourselves game on his account.	labels:He clearly does not respect you so you need to set up some discipline and ground rules..
text:that prick. For now... I am just left on my own.	labels:Honestly, he's your nephew.  So the fault lies on his parents..
text:Maybe so. I think he'll get around.	labels:But I really do hope you get your account back.  I'm sorry of how your online friends have treated you and your girlfriend..
text:Yeah. She started thinking all of my friends are like that but she figured out I have some good ones. Yeah. Thanks for the advice.	labels:And I hope my advice/suggestions have been helpful!
text:It was thank you very much.	labels:You're very welcome!  If that is all you have for me now, you can end the conversation.  It was nice conversating with you!	episode_done:True
text:Hi.\nhey.	labels:How are you friend?
text:Not so good.	labels:why? Any Problem?
text:I feel like everyone hates me.	labels:What's the reason?
text:People are so rude and mean to me. A lot of people call me annoying too.	labels:it's their fault , not yours. don't worry..
text:I feel bad because more than one person has said it. Maybe I am just annoying.	labels:Be as you always have been.
text:Sometimes I'm afraid of being myself because I don't want to annoy people.	labels:you don't think so..
text:Sometimes I hate myself.	labels:don't change yourself for  anyone..
text:I guess I shouldn't. But it's hard to express myself sometimes.	labels:ok, i did understand...
text:Im not really changing myself. I'm too afraid to express myself. What if I express myself and I annoy someone?	labels:it doesn't matter what others say about us, do your duty properly ok.
text:Sometimes what other people say bothers and hurts me deeply.	labels:don't think about that..
text:Sometimes its hard to not think about it.	labels: share your comments it is their choice whether to accept or disagree, but you don't change anything.
text:I understand.	labels:Hmm good.
text:Well thank you. im okay.	labels:Hmm all the best.	episode_done:True
text:Good evening.\nGood evening, thanks for taking the time to talk with me.	labels:No problem. How can I help you tonight?
text:I am having issues dealing with my feelings about ending my long term relationship with my children's father.	labels:So just to make sure I understand, you are struggling with dealing with ending a long term relationship with your child's father.
text:Exactly right, after 15 years and 4 kids, he cheated on me and the affair produced a child.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. My ex-fiance cheated on me and got pregnant with another man, so I know how rough this type of thing is. Have you been able to talk to him about it yet?
text:At this point, I don't want to talk, I am so disgusted I want nothing more to do with him, regardless of the kids.	labels:Have you talked to the kids about it? It will be important for them to understand what is going on and why.
text:The kids are pretty smart, they found out and was mad at first, but now they are accepting, which is making me even more disgusted. I have even started to resent my kids for it.	labels:I think it would help to sit down and have a conversation with them about it. It is important that they know how you feel and that you are there for them, and that they aren't the reason for the issues.
text:I did at least sit down with the kids about it, told t hem how I felt, explained the nature of the situation. But they weren't on my side, they acted like they were on my side at first but then switched up on me, made me feel like I was the one wrong!?!	labels:Have you thought about seeking a group of people who have been through this same situation that you are going through now? It often helps to talk to people who have been through the same things and get their help to get through the situation.
text:Apparently that's you smh lol.. How did you feel? What did you do?	labels:This is true I suppose. I made sure to have a conversation with her first in order to get some closure on the situation. After that I focused on more of my hobbies that I hadn't been able to do in a while in order to keep my mind distracted and off of the situation.
text:I'm still not ready to have that conversation with him. He's acting like I made him cheat on me. Maybe I should find some hobbies to distract myself until I can myself to that point.	labels:I think that would definitely help! What are some things you like to do?
text:How do I deal with my feelings of disgust? I like to color, I like to read, I like to do puzzles.	labels:You have to know that it wasn't your fault. He was the one who was unfaithful and there is nothing that you did to cause that. This was something I had to keep telling myself as I was trying to process everything. Sometimes it isn't easy, but you are your own biggest supporter. It wasn't your fault.
text:That definitely gave me some strength and closure, thank you so much!	labels:Not a problem at all! I know it's really hard right now, but I know you can make it through this!
text:With your kinds words and advice, I think I can now! Have a great night, thank you for taking time out to help me.	labels:Good, I am glad I was able to help you tonight!	episode_done:True
text:Hi.	labels:How are you?
text:I am good. How are you?	labels:I doing well. How may I help you?
text:I had a fight with my best friend.	labels:I understand that you have a dispute with your friend. Is that correct?
text:Yes, She asked for a help and that day I couldn't make it.	labels:What kind of help, if I may ask?
text:She wanted me to take her for the shopping and I was busy that day. She thought I was making excuses.	labels:I completely understand your frustration. Sometime work life balance is overwhelming.
text:I was so upset that she was not ready to understand and created a fight . I was angry on her.	labels:Have you discuss your frustration with her?
text:yes, but still she thinks that I was making excuses that day. She is not ready to listen.	labels:Experts says that when someone get emotional waiting some time might help reduce the tension..
text:You mean should I give her time?.	labels:That is correct. After some time, when emotion is down, you both can have a discussion about the incident..
text:We have been friends since childhood. For this reason I don't want to loose her. I will try your suggestion. Thanks.	labels:Thank you. Anything else I could help you with?
text:I will wait and try to talk to her after a while. Hope it will work. Do you have any other thought which I can try?	labels:I don't have any at this point in time..
text:No problem. Thanks for all your help. bye.	labels:Bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there.\nHello.	labels:Is there something you want to discuss?
text:yes. My birthday's coming up and I feel a lot of self-hatred for what I've failed to accomplish by this age.	labels:So it sounds like the birthday is a time for self-reflection, and you're not happy with where you are right now?
text:yea that's right. It's weighing heavy on my mind at the moment.	labels:Is this something you've felt on previous birthdays?
text:yes, the older I get the worse the feeling is. I didn't used to hate birthdays when I was younger.	labels:I'll confess I have felt the same way, especially with "milestone" birthdays (30, 40, 50, etc.). Do you think you are possibly expect too much in terms of achievements?
text:Yes, those are hard. My 30th was difficult. Society has so many wrong ideas of where people need to be, and it just doesn't apply to me. I'm so different from normal people. maybe, but being autistic, even average achievements are hard for me. I have to work so hard just to be average. May I ask, how did you deal with your own birthday depression? Maybe I can learn from you.	labels:As I became older, i started to wonder what terms like  "normal people" and being "average" really mean. Am I comparing myself to something that even exists?
text:That's what I've been thinking about too. It probably doesn't exist, but society would have us believe otherwise.	labels:That's so true. It's tough to deal with. But I will same, as I became older, I just stopped caring as much about what other's think. It just happened.
text:Yep, it sure is. I figure people stop caring that much when they get older.	labels:Also, I'm sure there are some things in life you are good at, even if those aren't what society seems to value.
text:I've already stopped caring what people younger than me think. They just seem so young to me. yea, it's just hard when I struggle so much with employment. My issues really keep me from succeeding in jobs. Sure, there are things I can do; but they don't seem to help me with anything important in life, if you know what I mean.	labels:Yeah, I hear you. Are you talking to others -  such as professionals, etc. - about your autism?
text:I was forced into therapy as a young person. I think it put me off seeking professional help because I hated the experience. But I talk to other autistic people in support groups online. Also, I'm sorry to cut this off but I need to go soon. I want to tell you you're quite compassionate and kind.	labels:Being "forced" to do anything is usually a turn off. But it's good to hear there are groups online to help.
text:I've enjoyed talking to you. Yes indeed. It's not a great experience unless you choose it.	labels:Oh, thanks. It's always nice to have a real conversation with someone.
text:For sure. May I ask if you're planning to become a counselor? I didn't know if this simulation is for people to get training for that type of wokr.	labels:I haven't planned on it, but I am looking for a career change. But no, this wasn't training for me. Not sure what this simulation is all about :)
text:Oh cool. I think this is a pretty interesting platform. haha me too, but it seemed interesting.	labels:Yep. Oh well, hope this was worth while for you.
text:I came here the other day and never got matched with anyone so I left. Thanks, it was. And you seem really cool. I guess we can wrap up since it's over 15 mins. and they said we can stop after 15 i think.	labels:Thanks. Be sure to do something enjoyable on your birthday..
text:Thank you:) Hope you enjoy your day/night.	labels:OK. Do I just hit "Quit"? I forget.
text:I think we both have the finish button. So we can click any time. I'll exit now. See you:)	labels:Take care.	episode_done:True
text:hello, how're you?	labels:GOOD. What bring you here today.
text:I'm feeling rather sad. I used to have a very close-knit group of friends, basically my best friends. We would talk all the time, hang out together, and basically just do everything together. Because of Covid, I've had to stay in my house and basically not associate with anyone else. My friends don't even try to talk to me anymore. I understand that life goes on without me, but they could at least try. They never even offered to wear a mask around me. They would make fun of me when I wore a mask. They didn't support my decisions when I was trying to still be a part of the group while also protecting my family (since they are all high risk)	labels:So what I hear you saying is that since COVID your friends won't talk to you and that they make fun of you for wanting to wear a mask and protect yourself?
text:Yes. Sure they've tried to stay in touch but it's always me starting the conversation. Or if they start it, it only involves "hi how're you, good how're you," and then the conversation ends.	labels:I am sorry to hear that your friends have been so distant lately.  Have you tried to ask them why they have been this way?
text:Yes. They say that because I'm not hanging out with them physically, it's hard. They also say that I don't put effort into conversations when I feel like I am the only one putting in effort (which I have stated and they have said I don't).	labels:So what I hear you saying is that they have backed away from you because you have chosen to take precautions due to COVID and they are choosing to not? Is that correct?
text:Yes this is correct..	labels:Well you are being smart by doing the right thing and protecting yourself and others during this time.  You should not feel bad about what you are doing.
text:Thank you. I just don't know what to do in this situation. I don't want to keep reaching out when I don't feel like they actually want to keep in contact with me. I know we could still get along well, but it's hard when I'm the only one to make the effort.	labels:Do you have any other friends besides this group?  Do you have other people that you could reach out to that are social distancing that you could relate to more during this time that you would have more in common with right now?
text:I have very few that have similar thoughts as me that I have tried to reach out to. But most of them have their own lives, boyfriends/girlfriends, and things they do. Mostly everyone seems to be hanging out with people which leaves me physically left out..	labels:What hobbies or activities do you like to do?
text:I play field hockey so I train a lot in my basement (because I'm scared to go out to the gym), I listen to music, read, watch Christmas movies, and I love talking to people. Honestly, I'm okay. I have my family and other things to occupy my time. It's just hard finding other friends right now in the times we're living in.	labels:Field hockey that sounds like an exciting sport to play!  That does sound like it would keep you busy. Have you thought about the possibility of meeting people online that share some of the same things that you like to do and that you could talk to ?
text:I don't want to go actually practice on a field right now because 1.) It's rather cold outside 2.) I have to wear a mask 3.) I'd only shoot on goal, waste gas, and a good chunk of time. But when I have other people it is fun. I haven't tried that because where would I even go? I don't want to be desperate either ya know?	labels:I understand that you feel that you would look desperate but you said you like reading book so there may be some online book clubs that you could join.  I know that I have been involved in those and I didn't feel like I was seen as desperate since there are so many people that want to be social but don't want to put themselves at risk.
text:I never thought of that! That's is an amazing idea -- maybe I will look into that. Thank you for talking with me today.	labels:I am so glad I was able to help. Maybe we can try and set up another time to talk again?
text:Sure!	labels:Sounds great. You can let me know if you found a book club.
text:Awesome! Thanks again for everything -- and merry christmas. or happy holidays sorry.	labels:You are so very welcome.  Merry Christmas to you too! .  I look forward to talking to you soon!.	episode_done:True
text:I'm sooo pissed at my friend!	labels:Hi. I see that you are upset.  I have been at times as well.. What about your friend is making you upset?
text:I was completely betrayed by him!	labels:What about him has made you feel betrayed?
text:I told my friend I kind of have a thing for this guy in our friend group and he actually told the guy! This guys has a girlfriend and I'm really cool with her. Now everything is soooo awkward.	labels:I have been in situations where similar comments have been made.
text:My friend has been drinking a lot and he cant keep his drunk mouth shut. I'm like ready to completely dump him as a friend in a minute. I mean, it's covid. He should just stay tf home.	labels:Could you tell him that he could see a professional that could help him quit drinking? What ways could you find some support groups  for your friend regarding his issues?
text:I mean, I have sort of said it before in a really joking way. But now i'm worried it may be a problem. I feel like if he wants help he should find it himself.	labels:It might be worthwhile to recommend him look into getting some counseling about his issues that you seem to think are a real issue.
text:he has completely isolated me from ppl i care about.	labels:How long has this isolating been occurring? I know that your friend has a lot of issues to address, but you can give him an impetus to look at changing for the BETTER.
text:Well, one time he got drunk and kept calling me ugly in a joking way while we were at a party with a group of new ppl. He seems to have an agenda to embarass me.	labels:There is a group like AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) that could be a great support for your friend. I have dealt with friends like this, but the sooner he can get help for his alcohol issues, it could better your relationship with him.
text:I think I have to ask him to get help and withdraw my friendship, completely if he chooses to continue the way he is.	labels:I am glad to provide suggestions like AA and other support groups.
text:Thank you very much.	labels:What else can I help you with? Were my suggestions helpful?
text:Yes, I guess I just wonder if I should include our other friends.	labels:I feel that the right suggestions can help.  Alcohol can be a real issue with maintaining meaningful relationships.
text:Is it betrayal if i tell them that he has been drinking excessively?	labels:You could also be part of his support group if he agrees to AA. No, I don't feel it is betrayal. You care about him. Do you have any more questions or concerns for me to reflect on?	episode_done:True
text:Hi.	labels:Hello. How may i help you today?
text:I had misunderstanding with my friend and I have fear that I am gonna loose her.	labels:Can you explain to me what the misunderstanding was about?
text:I was bit busy and wasn't able to talk to her for a few days, so  she thought I was ignoring her.	labels:Ok i see so she thinks you are ignoring her?
text:Yes, she thinks I am ignoring her, but I never meant to do that. I tried to tell her that I was busy with some work, but she thought I was lying to her and now I'm very sad.	labels:I understand how you are feeling about that I would be upset to.
text:What should I do to still be friends with her? I don't know what to do anymore!	labels:Have you tried to talk to her again recently?
text:Yes. I even texted her and called her. She opened my messages but didn't respond and she even ignored my calls..	labels:I would give her 2 or 3 days to her self then try to talk to her again.
text:Its been more than 3 days and I have given her time. I don't think I can wait longer. I might loose her.	labels:Maybe you should go up to her house.
text:Due to the COVID cases right now I am trying to not risk the safety of others and myself. I don't know that going up to her house would be the best option at this moment :(	labels:Right i can understand.
text:We have been friends for so many years and I do not know why she is acting like that. I do not want to loose this precious friendship..	labels:I would suggest just keep trying to talk to her and apologize and tell her you been really busy and was not trying to ignore her. Send her a apology card in the mail.
text:I appreciate your suggestions. This sounds like a good option. Thank you so much for your help!	labels:your welcome I hope yall will work it out.
text:I hope so as well.	labels:Things will get better for you to.
text:Hope you have a wonderful Holiday..	labels:Have a wonderful holiday to.	episode_done:True
text:I am sooo pissed at my ex.	labels:Hai.
text:hi.	labels:why? Any problem?
text:well we were together for 3 years. he broke up with me a week ago but we're on the lease for the apartment and share the place with 5 other people. He moved into the room we had open. but now he's turning my roommates against me. i think he's pissed because i'm dating my other ex again.	labels:oh, you settle elsewhere.
text:you think i should move?	labels:yes.
text:This place is amazing tho and my dad is the cosigner. the landlord would never let my roomies take over the lease with their credit. i'm thinking of kicking all them out, actually. i dont want to. i just want to be friends witgh everyone again. we were all so close.	labels:ok clarify your friendship value.
text:I have 2 roommates that actually moved here with me from my previous apartment. The rest r new but they're sweet and we've really bonded. we all tripped shrooms together one night and we are like really close now.	labels:ok, tell your friend what you think.
text:it's just sooo uncomfortable to discuss. what if im just being paranoid. i mean part of me feels like they just feel awkward and arent icing me out on purpose.	labels:clarify, what you think.
text:i mean no one has specifically said anything to me that was negative, but suddenly i feel like people are avoiding me. we used to hang out in the living room all the time and we would eat these big meals, but yesterday i came home and they were all cooking with my ex. they said they made enough for me but it seemed like such an after thought.	labels:That problem would not be possible  if you did not speak.
text:you mean if we DID speak?	labels:Tell them what you think in your mind and they will surely understand.
text:i think i just want to know that we're all still friends, i guess. I want our house to feel like home, again.	labels:ok, you clarify your reasons for them.
text:ok, yeah you're right. I just need to have a conversation with them. I guess. thank you.	labels:of course  everything will be fine. ok, good, best of luck,.	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you tonight?\nHey. It's the middle of the day where I am located and I'm well thanks. I have the day off work today.	labels:Oh! I live in KY and it's 8 pm at night! lol Well, good afternoon to you!  A pleasure to meet you, how can I encourage you today?
text:I have no local close friends, they all live overseas. With the holiday season it gets lonely as there's no one in my city to celebrate Christmas with.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. I am in the same boat! We have no close friends and family near us, we moved here to a very rural area in KY some years ago, so I understand.. Do you live alone?
text:Yeah I do.	labels:One thing I started doing was calling a few people I met online on the phone to just chat. I started that about 2 months ago and it REALLY helped with my lonliness. I had to step out of my comfort zone as normally, I'm not a phone person..
text:How did you meet them online?	labels:On FB in groups. I got to chatting with the same people, then began to inbox and then asked them if I  could call. If you are in a group, you could even ask if anyone else would like to connect as friends. I am a woman, so I just picked women..
text:I feel like I would struggle to establish a connection with someone over the phone. There are no restrictions in my city at the moment so I would really like to meet some people face to face.	labels:I was just thinking of ideas for me to make local friends too. Perhaps you could invite people to your home for Christmas, then when they say they have something occurring, perhaps they will realize you are alone and then invite you?. Are there any churches feeding people on Christmas? Sometimes that is a great way to meet others and help too.
text:Sadly most people here spend Christmas with their families and are quite private about not inviting outsiders. Last year I spent it with a friend but he is going to his family this year. I can find out about churches, I have no idea.	labels:I know it can be very difficult to be alone, why not input your town name in the FB search ad, maybe join local groups to see if there are any civic activities too..
text:Yeah I'll give that a go.	labels:There always seems to be people in the same boat I am in, it is just a matter of thinking outside the box and perhaps even calling friends and asking for suggestions. I will definitely say a prayer that you find some people to share a meal with..
text:Thanks for listening and for your suggestions.	labels:You are welcome. Don't give up, keep trying. It is hard. I've been alone a few times in my life and while I like to be alone, sometimes I really want some people in my life! :D .
text:Yeah I do enjoy my alone time, just not around the holidays haha.	labels:I totally get it..
text:Thanks and have a good night!	labels:You are welcome! You have a blessed afternoon and evening!. I believe you have to end the conversation and then we are done! :D.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there. Is there anything bothering you that you'd like to talk about at the moment?.\nHi. Yes, I'm having a hard time because last year my dad died a few days after Christmas.	labels:Oh I am so sorry! Dealing with bereavement is hard at any time but at this time of year I think that it is even worse..
text:When people ask about Christmas plans, I don't want to depress everyone. But I can't pretend everything's okay.	labels:So you feel as though you have to avoid people because you do not want to make them feel bad that you are feeling bad?.
text:I don't know... I know my friends would be supportive. But then I feel like it's selfish of me to bring people down, when this whole year has been a downer for so many of us.	labels:Well let me ask you - if the situation were reversed, would you feel that a close friend was bringing you down if they talked about their bereavement?.
text:Maybe, but I wouldn't mind that.	labels:Well, perhaps your friends would not mind you confiding in them either? That is what good friends are for, ultimately..
text:Another thing is that my mom had died in January, the same year. So everyone has already dealt with me grieving all year. I don't want to just be associated with sadness for everyone.	labels:I am really sorry about that - that is a seriously rough thing to have had to deal with. Do you have siblings and if so could you perhaps talk with them?.
text:I have a brother, but his wife is really terrible, and they are very close. He and I text some, and I try to keep that up. He doesn't need me the way I need him...	labels:What about some sort of professional therapy? There are some organisations out there that will provide a certain number of sessions for free.
text:Hmm, I didn't know that. I'm on a waiting list for a therapist through my medical insurance. I live in sort of rural Oregon, but maybe I could get help by text or video...	labels:That is a good idea, especially at this time when it's probably not a good idea to see too many new people in person. Could you call your doctor and ask them?.
text:The issue is finding someone you click with. I think that's hard. I'm not sure my doctor could do much for me - she's already got me on the waiting list for therapy through her organization.	labels:Have you tried searching online? I have personally found some useful groups that have helped me deal with the mental health issues that I have..
text:If it wasn't for COVID, I'd probably look into support groups... Oh yeah? Can you recommend anywhere to start?	labels:There are plenty available online where you would not need to see anyone in person. Try googling for support groups in your local area?. I'd really recommend doing that, it could help you a lot! I wish you all the best and hope that 2021 is a better year for you..
text:Okay. I also just moved to a new state, and don't really know anyone yet. It's a hard time for making new connections. Thank you - best wishes to you, too!	labels:That is tough ... so you are feeling uprooted as well as bereaved? I can only hope things go well for you.
text:At least I'll never lose another parent...	labels:That's a slightly macabre way of looking at it but .. true.. Have a lovely festive season.
text:You too. Bring on 2021!!	labels:quite!! Do press the quit button and take the survey ;).	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHello.	labels:How may i help you today?
text:I have a co worker who sleeps all the time at his desk.  I physically work hard everyday.	labels:I can understand how you are feeling..
text:It makes me mad.  No one says a word to him, he just sleeps and gets paid for it.	labels:Has anyone else noticed him sleeping all the time at his desk?
text:My boss said (I have been there for five years) to me one day did I see DE sleeping at his desk? I was floored that it seemed he never saw him do it before.  How could he not?	labels:That is really weird how can someone not see him sleeping at his desk.
text:Very weird.  I am one of the oldest men there and I am always expected to jump in and do work that is manual labor.  Very frustrating to see someone else just sleeping.	labels:Have you talked to your co worker about it?
text:It really would not be my place, it would be up to my boss.  He obviously said nothing. .	labels:if your boss said nothing to him then maybe you should step up and say something even though you are right that is not your place.
text:I keep hoping that one of the upper management team will walk by one day and see him.	labels:Your boss does not sound like a good boss at all and not doing his job correctly.
text:Definitely not being fair across the board, in my eyes.	labels:i feel like you should have like a serious talk to your boss about it.
text:You're probably correct.  I may feel better just getting it out, even if the situation does not change.	labels:I don't want you feeling how you feeling because you are doing your job and you are doing everything you can to solve the problem.
text:Thank you, that helps hearing that from someone. .	labels:How long has this been going on? Your welcome.
text:Seriously, over two years.  True.	labels:How many times have you confronted your boss about it?
text:I never have, I just looked at him like are you for real when he asked me if the guy was sleeping the one day.  I had to bite my tongue not to say, yes, and he does it every day!	labels:So he must not believe you.
text:Well thank you for letting me get this out.  I appreciate the advice and I will definitely think over talking with my boss.  Have a good night!	labels:have a good night to and your welcome.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.\nHello.	labels:How are you today?
text:Really bad. My 10 year marriage is failing. Things have not gotten better.	labels:What happened?
text:That's the thing. Nothing really happened. No cheating, drugs, or abuse. I suppose the euphoria has worn off, and she just doesn't find me interesting anymore.	labels:I understand how you feel. Have you guys tried spending more time with each other? Maybe going out on dates?
text:Maybe we haven't done this enough in the past. We both had busy careers. I tried initiating this last year, but without success. Maybe, I was too late..	labels:Its never too late to put spice back into the relationship.
text:I hope you're right. Do you have other suggestions about how to do so?	labels:Show her that your still love because by being spontaneous. Surprise her with gifts. Maybe take her on a random vacation somewhere. Have a deep conversation about how you are feeling and that you still love her and want her in your life. It might take a little bit but its better to try than not to try at all.
text:I think your suggestions are very helpful. A vacation is currently out of the picture due to COVID. I want to try having deep conversations, but I don't know where to start.	labels:Start by talking about whats going on. Tell her how you think you guys should spend more time with her. Or that you dont want to lose her. Ask her if there is anything she might want to discuss. She maybe having issues shes afraid to talk about.
text:I think you hit upon something. She is quite hesitant in talking about issues. Do you have any thoughts about marriage counselling? We've never tried that.	labels:I think that would be a good idea. Having the chance to get things out and getting more advice is always helpful. Make sure you leave any issues at common ground.
text:If my wife is the one having issues with conversations, do you think a male or female therapist/counsellor would be better? I want her to feel comfortable expressing herself.	labels:Most likely a female therapist would be better. Nobody understands a woman more than a woman.
text:I think that sounds like a safer choice. I was also hoping if you have suggestions for me personally. I am quite depressed and I am having problems getting through the day.	labels:I suggest taking one step at a time. I wouldn't rush through things. I would suggest sitting down and talking through some things that are going on. Maybe taking some time away from work. Going out and spending time with each other as much as you can.. If you guys think you may need a marriage counselor, I highly recommend it. I think it would be a great start.
text:Thank you very much for your response. You have been very helpful. Perhaps, one last question - my wife and I have been hiding our problems away from our teen-age son. Do you agree that we should continue to keep it from him?	labels:Depending on the nature, I think you should let him know whats going on. He may already know.
text:Ok, thanks for all your help again. I feel much better now, and hopefully I will get through this.	labels:I know its really hard, but I think you guys with work things out. Have hope. Times are stressful, especially in this day and age.
text:Take care, friend, good-bye.	labels:goodbye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello! Is there something I can help you with? Would you like to tell me how you're feeling?\nyes. i have been facing trouble in my job.	labels:Right now, are you still employed?
text:yes.	labels:What kind of troubles are you facing at your job?
text:there is an announcement that my company has decided to give layoff to 50 percent of their employees.	labels:Oh, I can understand how worried you must be! Do you think you will be laid off?
text:yes .	labels:I am so very sorry to hear that. Do you mind me asking what type of job it is?
text:i am working as a supervisor in a private manufacturing company. currently working from home. feeling so depressed regarding this issue.	labels:I have been in a similar situation and understand how scary it is. Have you been looking for another job or are you waiting to see if you are laid off?
text:yes i am trying for another job, but is not so easy to get in this covid 19 pandemic situation.	labels:Yes! The pandemic has turned the world upside down, it seems like..
text:yes that is main reason for depression.	labels:Have you thought of going back to school or have you completed your education?
text:i have completed my bachelor degree.	labels:I am so very sorry that you are struggling with depression..
text:yes, i cant know how to get  normal from this depression.	labels:You have been a supervisor and you already have your degree, so you are ahead of lots of people. Have you been able to see a doctor or a therapist to talk to?
text:yes ,.	labels:And I know that sounded presumptuous of me to say "you are ahead of lots of people", but it does seem like a "positive" in your favor.. I'm glad you have been able to talk to someone..
text:thank you. i am also feeling so relieved while talking with you.	labels:I feel like the world is in some kind of "holding" pattern until the pandemic is under control.. I'm glad just talking has made you feel a little better!.
text:yes this pandemic situation gives more tough situations. lets pray that the pandemic situation will come to an end soon.	labels:Amen to that!.
text:amen. thanks.	labels:I am hoping that you will find a new (and better!) job that you absolutely love!  Stay safe...and positive!	episode_done:True
text:Hi there!	labels:Hello! How are you doing today?
text:Oh, not too bad - and you?	labels:I'm doing well. How can I help you today?
text:I'm just getting frustrated with a cousin of mine. I really appreciate her support through stuff like both my parents dying last year, and I'm trying to support her, too... But she'll be set off by completely unpredictable things. I try hard to avoid any possible conflict, but she finds a way to get hurt anyway.	labels:I can understand why this would be frustrating for you. Its good that you are trying to support her. Have you talked to her about the way you're feeling?
text:We hardly ever talk on the phone, which sometimes would be easier. I just feel like she's so close to losing it all the time, I don't want to seem critical.	labels:Do you think she is any sort of danger that someone should know about?
text:Only in the sense that she could have a nervous breakdown, or collapse from exhaustion. She's really strong, though.	labels:That is understandable. Do you think it's to the point where maybe you should say something to her about it? Even if you might sound a bit critical?
text:Well, I have asked her about counseling, and she does have a counselor. Her husband won't do joint counseling. A decade ago, I might have talked to her mom about it, but her mom is now frail herself, and her own husband is a lot to handle. I feel protective of my aunt, too. I almost feel like her counselor doesn't do much good for her, but I know there are different styles of therapy... I feel like the therapist just echoes back to her how awful her husband is, etc (he's not really that bad, but they've grown apart). But if I ever say anything like this, she just doesn't speak to me for weeks. I know I need to try to approach the topic with her. It would be better in person, but that's not easy now. We live 800 miles apart, too.	labels:Have you thought of any possible solutions you think could possibly work to fix this issue?
text:Her issues, or the issue of her blowing up over anything I say?	labels:All of the above!
text:Her time is so jam-packed, it's hard. I paid for her to take a vacation up near me. But she had two of her kids with her, so we couldn't really talk. I wish I could just have her to myself for 24 hours - ha. She acts like the kids are in danger with just her husband, which is completely untrue.	labels:Do you think these issues are serious enough to get a proffessional involved?
text:Well, she has her therapist. I'm not sure what I could really do.	labels:You may have to make a decision and determine how big her issues are.
text:Yes.... I think talking to our other cousin about her might be a good place to start.	labels:Yes. How do you feel about doing that? Do you think that would help?
text:I think it might help... It's one of these things - everyone has so much going on in their own lives... But of course it's also therapeutic to feel like you're helping someone you love. So it might be good for both cousins. All three cousins.	labels:I think that sounds like a great thing! Sometimes we just need to get together and help out the people we love going through tough times!
text:Yes, I agree... Well, I'll give it a shot. Thanks for talking to me.	labels:Of course! I hope all goes well!
text:You too. Have a great holiday. SO ready for a new year, with new promise...	labels:You as well!
text:Bye-bye!	labels:Bye!	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you this evening?	labels:Hello Doing good. How are doing?
text:I've been better. The holidays aren't helping me feel better about not bringing much money home to help pay for things.	labels:Sorry to hear this,have you ever tried selling on Ebay.
text:I've thought about selling stuff online, but the cost of selling things online isn't really worth it. I've been trying to use facebook marketplace, but I never have anyone who's interested.	labels:Have you ever heard of QVC liquidations,its awesome with some very good returns.
text:I've heard of QVC, but I've never heard of QVC liquidations. That might be something for me to consider. Can you give me more details about it?	labels:If your interested you will need to submit a sellers I.D. or tax id.
text:I see. Is this something that you've done to make money?	labels:Absolutely.
text:If you don't mind me asking how much have you made using QVC liquidations?	labels:I have made close to 12,000.00 in one year just reselling the returns.Also ESTY is  also a great place.
text:Wow, what sorts of things have you sold?	labels:Go to EBAY and scroll down to the the completed section and click it and this will show you the item your searching like homemade items or stuff like back packs that maybe on sell at Walmart and I buy them and see what they are selling for.
text:Okay, thanks for the suggestions.	labels:I have purchased a lot of stuff from walmart and resold it on EBAY. Its fun.
text:I worked with someone whose boyfriend did that. I've never thought about doing that. I might have to consider doing that so I can feel more helpful to my husband.	labels:Down load the Walmart app and when you go scan the item with app and sometimes its cheaper.
text:I don't shop at Walmart very much so thank you for that information.	labels:I saw a seller on EBAY make small surf boards and sold them on EBAY well over a hundred dollars.They were 48 inches long but he made good money.
text:That is very interesting. I wouldn't think you could make that much from small surfboards.	labels:He painted them and they looked awesome.
text:I wouldn't think that anyone would want a short surfboard, but I guess I don't know anything about surfing.	labels:People who own and rent their beach house always looking for some new looks.
text:I suppose you are right. Well thanks for the helpful suggestions to make more money.	labels:Your welcome Don't ever give up there is always ways to make a difference.
text:I appreciate your help. Have a good night!	labels:You too.	episode_done:True
text:Good afternoon/evening.	labels:Hello, how are you tonight?
text:Doing great. How about yourself?	labels:I'm doing well how can I help you tonight?
text:So, the issue I'm having is work-related. My son had heart surgery a few months ago. He now has a pacemaker. He's also in the middle of testing for CP. My job requires that I be around a lot of people. I always wear a mask...but sometimes the people I am with do not. Nor do they respect the 6-foot boundary.A simple cold gives my son a fever of 103. Im scared that if I continue to work, Im putting him in danger. But if I stop, I can no longer afford bills. My son just turned 2.	labels:I can see where this would be frustrating. As parents our biggest goal is to keep them safe and healthy. Have you thought about having a conversation with the people you are around to inform them you'd wish they wear a mask?
text:I have. A few people respected my wishes. But one in particular stands out. A gentleman who told me he had a medical condition and proceeded to get in my face. He got angry at my request. In my shoes, what would you do? Because I feel like Im stuck between a rock and a hard place lol.	labels:I understand how you feel. Can you tell me a little more about how it makes you feel when they don't honor your requests?
text:It makes me feel trapped. Frustrated. I would never intentionally try to put someone else in harms way and I feel like I dont. *don't get the same courtesy. I feel frustrated because I'm REQUIRED to deal with people. I work in construction. I feel trapped because, what are my options? Continue to work.....my son gets sick and dies. His pediatrician has already warned me how deadly this could be for me. And if I quit? No money? I have a 5 year old I have to take care of too.	labels:I can see exactly how frustrated you are in this situation. Before I share some ideas do you have any ideas of ways to combat this issue?.
text:I've spoken to my boss. He was sympathetic about it all....At this point I'm not sure what to do.	labels:Alright. Have you talked to your boss about working in areas where you can be around people less? Or possibly going part time for now and finding a lob that puts less danger on you and your family?
text:Those are fairly decent ideas. The struggle for money would still be an issue if I worked part-time. And I doubt I could find a better job at this particular time. With that being said, I didn't think to see if the boss would let me work in the office for a bit. I know my fellow employees would respect my wishes. Any other suggestions?	labels:We are going through some really tough times right now and I think that most people are very sympathetic. Especially for those who are in your shoes. Our children are our top priority and seeing them sick hurts us more than anything. How do you feel about talking to your boss about working in the office for a bit until things calm down a little? Do you get paid vacation time in your job?
text:That sounds like a reasonable thing to do. I do get paid vacation.	labels:Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile. I know it may not be the most fun time to do it but then you know you're keeping safe! I'm not sure of all the details on your job so I'm having a hard time making firm suggestions. How would you feel about that?	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you tonight?\nhanging in there, kinda freaking out a little.	labels:I'm sorry to hear you are freaking out. Perhaps a friendly listening ear can encourage you? Why are you freaking out?
text:I think that'll help, yeah.	labels:Sometimes just a friend to hear you out and encourage you can really make a difference. Life has its ups and down..
text:I decided to leave my husband, he keeps snapping at me and won't listen to me or let me do anything.	labels:That's a difficult decision you have made..
text:I'm worried how it'll go though because we have kids.	labels:Have you tried to talk to him about the problem? Or a counselor?.
text:I've tried to talk to him about the control issues, but he doesn't listen. He doesn't know I'm planning to leave and I think he'll try to stop me.	labels:I have worked at a domestic violence shelter before, the most dangerous time to leave a situation like this is when you leave.  Do you have a plan in place?
text:I have some leads on apartments and some savings I'm putting aside, and a friend I plan on living with.	labels:My husband used to be very controlling as well, I dragged him to counseling. He changed. He bucked at first, but eventually he went. We have gone a few times off and on over 20 years. We both came from broken homes.
text:I haven't got 100% of the details worked out yet, but I'm trying.	labels:Has he hurt you physically? or is he mainly emotionally abusive?
text:He hasn't hurt me physically. I often feel like he would but I'm also a child abuse survivor so it's hard to tell if that's true or just a memory.	labels:I'm glad to hear that. I can understand that you would be really stressed at this time, however, I do encourage you to get a good plan in place, and definitely get counseling..
text:I think that's the best idea.	labels:Yes, I had child abuse in my life too, I really think counseling saved our marriage, 3 times. But like, I said, he didn't want to go. However, the first time, I did leave and stay with a friend, and that convinced him I was serious..
text:that's a good thought, I wonder what he'd do if I stayed with a friend.	labels:I wish I could fix this, but I can't. The road will be rocky and I don't know how I would have made it without people to encourage and support me, so I'm glad a friend is willing to have you stay with them until you can get on your feet..
text:hey may not realize I'd leave at all. me too, that's making all the difference.	labels:My husband really loved me, but coming from a broken home, he lost his mom when he was 12, so he thought controlling me was the solution, very messed up, but he had to learn to see that..
text:definitely that makes sense.	labels:He feared I would die or leave him or something, but once he saw that, and realized what he was doing was hurting me and making me want to leave, he changed. But honestly, I have never understood men and why they dont' see life the way we do. Sometimes it takes that objective person to help them see it..
text:I'm not convinced mine loves me, looking back it's beginning to seem like he was draining me for my income and labor.	labels:Ouch! That sounds painful to look at..
text:it is, I think I was super wrong about him and overlooked red flags.	labels:People who truly love others become willing to change. Sometimes it takes a DRASTIC measure to wake them up, like leaving. He has not heard you, so many he will "hear" it when you leave. But please be careful and have a plan.. How long have you been married?
text:eight years, together for 11.	labels:That's a long time. I will say a prayer for your safety and for you to get some help, hopefully he will join you. Marriage is a lot of work, but it can't be one person, it has to be two.. Don't leave anything in writing around until after you leave..
text:absolutely! definitely no paper trail, for sure.	labels:I believe in the power of prayer too. The Serenity prayer is a good one to help me let go of my fears and do what I can, leaving the rest to God..
text:I know that one, it's helping me a lot too.	labels:If I worry and get upset, then I waste energy, I have had to learn to get distracted if I find myself on that worry train, call a friend, go for a walk, just not obsess, it goes nowhere.. And I urge you to get a counselor..
text:that's good advice! I will. Thank you.	labels:You are welcome. Watch your thinking, when it goes off track, take charge, change your thinking, get up and move about and do something else because it's not healthy for you to worry. As you said, you freak out, and that is not good for you or your children.
text:definitely, I think I can do that! I feel a lot better!	labels:It's a rough situation, it will be difficult, you seem very intelligent, have thought about this, are working on a plan and are able to discuss it. That's a big plus on yoru side..
text:Thank you! I'm feeling a lot more confident!	labels:I'm glad to hear it. Keep the faith, all will be well in due time! Sometimes rough roads really work out, but it never FEELS that way!  You have a good night! :D.	episode_done:True
text:hi.	labels:Hello. How are you?
text:I don't know how to cope with Martins anymore. I am fine anyway.	labels:What is Martins?
text:WE have been friends for the past 10 years, I have been trying to ignore his fake and lie life style.	labels:My sorry this is happening to you. Would you like to talk about it?
text:he will never tell you, truth, last week we fix an appointment at the park by 4pm, you will not believe it that I waited from 4pm till 6.30pm... he will tell you I will soon be there. all kinds of lying.	labels:I have had old friends do that do me. The best thing to do is let go of them and try to find a better friend. I had a friend that I was friends with for 11 years and she dropped out of the blue. Since then, I have come across a lot of amazing friends..
text:he will never tell you truth. If Martins is seeing red like this in your front , he will tell you is white. mmmmh.	labels:That's really had to deal with. Try to surround yourself with loyal and truthful people.
text:I really wish to drop this guy out of the blue but it is our business that still attaché us together. He do help me collect my goods from Canada a.	labels:Do you guys run a business together?
text:not really. at a time , I will not want to leave my family to go to Canada for some goods, he do go there often. that is only major thing that still bind us. I should have let he go off my life.	labels:I understand. Maybe you could find a better friend to help you go to Canada or take a vacation to Canada sometimes.
text:ok.	labels:Its really hard but  I think you can do it. You will feel much better about not having to deal with lies all the time.
text:I hate lies, it really pain me if a you lie to me. yes of cause. thanks , for you time. bye.	labels:bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, My name is DJ, Thank you for your time. How are you?	labels:Hi, I'm Vicky! I'm doing pretty well :) How can I help you through your issues today?
text:I'm glad to hear that you are doing well. As far as the issue, I'm not sure how you can other than listening and encouraging.	labels:No problem! I would love to be a listening ear for you to talk about it and work through anything stuck in your mind.
text:Yeah, she is visiting for a couple of days. It is great to see her and our Grand-baby. He had to work so he's not here. He's a great guy to everyone else. But not to her. We can see how their relationship has decreased and the little one is copying his poor behavious.	labels:omgsh I'm so sorry to hear that. Is this your daughter's partner? I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship before and know how difficult it can be.
text:It is good for her to be here with us. She can talk with her Mother and pray together. Yes, this  is her husband. I'm sorry to hear you went through the emotional abuse.. It is rough. I've got to be careful not to react to him.	labels:From my personal experience, I can say that your support really means everything to her. She may not want to admit the truth to herself, but with your support, I believe she can find the strength to get out of the relatioship.
text:Yeah, she does know what is going on between them and how it is impacting the little one. And, I am thankful she trusts us with what is going on. They both need support and strength.	labels:Yes I completely understand. It's a very delicate situation. I've read multiple times that it takes an average of 7 times to leave an abusive relationship (even though I think I tried even more times than that). She will hopefully one day gather the courage to realize she doesn't deserve to be treated badly. You are amazing for being her support!
text:Yeah, she has a good support system with her Mon and a couple very close friends. It;s one day at a time, listening and being available.	labels:That's seriously great to hear! I don't know what the exact situation is but I do know that she needs all the love she can get.
text:That is for sure. She will talk things through with her Mother, they have always been close and I help when needed. I'm thanksful she leans on on us. The little one loves coming for a visit.	labels:that's all you can do for now until the day that she will be able to take steps to leave the bad situation. I hope that this will be a productive visit from them. At the very least, they'll be able to see what real love looks like from you guys :)
text:Yeah, Thank you. I've got some ideas chatting with you. Vicky, Thank you. Have a Merry "Safe and fun" Christmas. Thanks for listening.	labels:I'm so happy to hear that. I would love to help anyone I can to get out of an abusive relationship because it was the darkest period of my whole life. I wish you the best of luck and Merry Christmas!

text:Hello. How may I help you today?\nhi. I am stressed with my 25 year old moved back from NYC. . My boyfriend and I have a home and my son does not like him.	labels:I am sorry to hear that i can understand how you must be feeling. Why does your son not like your boyfriend?
text:He is going back to school and I am supporting him in that. The problem is that my boyfriend thinks my son should speak to me more respectfully. He gets upset when my son is swears and shows anger to me.	labels:Have you talked to your boyfriend about how you are feeling?
text:He knows that I am torn. I am not going to put my son out of the house. I am also not one to get loud and angry. My son verbally is aggressive.	labels:I can understand why your boyfriend be getting upset if your son is disrespectful to you and is aggressive but you know that is your son and you going to be there for him no matter what.
text:Yes, and I have gotten my son to go to a therapist weekly to try to express his anger about the pandemic and the changes it has brought in his lifestyle. He cannot take his frustrustations out on us.	labels:How long has this been going on? Is the therapist working for him?
text:He came back last March for what we thought at the time would be a month or two.	labels:Have you had a conversation with your son about the way he is acting?
text:He is difficult to get through to. He seems to have traded midwestern charm for NYC bullying.	labels:Maybe he should start seeing a therapist every day maybe that will help.
text:I am not sure that he can afford that, but I have seen small changes in his behavior since he started seeing her. I want him to stop seeing my boyfriend as the enemy.	labels:maybe your boyfriend and your son needs to sit down and have a talk.
text:That may work with a therapist. I have tried to mediate and both were terribly bull headed and argumentative.	labels:or you know your boyfriend can plan out a day or something and your son and your boyfriend can go out and do something fun.
text:I am a quiet person and I want a happy household. .	labels:They should have a talk because communication is key and that will solve a lot.
text:Thank you. You are right. I just want to get rid of the tension in the house.	labels:I am sure he will stop the way he is acting it just may take some time.
text:Thank you. I want him to grow him quickly. He is 25 and is doing okay. No need to be angry.	labels:You are right he still got a whole life ahead of him.
text:Thank you. Have a good evening.	labels:your welcome have a good evening to.	episode_done:True
text:Hello there, how is life treating you at the moment?.\nIt is treating me pretty well. How about you?	labels:I can't complain :) Is there anything specific that you'd like to talk to me about today?.
text:What are you hobbies?	labels:I like to listen to people's problems. I am training to be a counsellor.  What would you like to talk about?.
text:That's a unique interest.  How much longer do you have before you are a counsellor?	labels:About 12 minutes. Would you like to tell me what is on your mind at the moment?.
text:Do you have any kids?	labels:No I don't. I am here specifically to help you with problems that you might be facing at the moment. Do you have any problems at work, for instance?.
text:I have a problem with finding work that doesn't need me to work on the weekend.	labels:Ah I hear you there! Some employers are so inconsiderate; they expect us to drop everything and work at any time of any day..
text:I wouldn't mind it if I had local daycares that were opened on the weekend. .	labels:Ah, so I hear you saying that one of the things that you are struggling with is finding affordable childcare?.
text:Isn't the affordable part but finding a daycare open on the weekend at all.  I don't want a private person. I would feel more comfortable with a daycare setting.	labels:What are your objections against a private person? Is it that you feel you could not trust them? Do you have any family members who could help?.
text:I have no family that can help.  Yes, its me not trusting some random person.  In a daycare their cameras and others being around makes me feel more comfortable.	labels:Could someone come to your home perhaps? You could set up your own cameras there. And you could make sure to get someone with excellent references.
text:I wouldn't even know where to begin to look.  Any suggestions?	labels:You might be able to find good advice on local parenting forums. There must be other people there who are in the same situation..
text:Where would I find a local parenting forums?  I'm not very tech savy so I'm lost on all of that.	labels:Try going to google, inputting your local area and searching for parenting advice forums :).
text:That sounds easy enough!  I never thought of this as being an option.	labels:I hope you are able to find someone who can set your mind at ease! Thank you for talking and have a wonderful festive season..
text:You do the same!  Thanks for your advise and time :)	labels:no worries :) remember to hit the button and  take the survey ;).
text:Thanks for reminding me!	labels:I can't actually do it from my end until you do :).	episode_done:True
text:Hello.	labels:Hello there. How are things treating you at the moment?.
text:Could be better or worse, how are you?	labels:Pretty much sums it up really. I think that that is how a lot of us are feeling right now. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?.
text:I have been getting migraines lately which is not fun.	labels:Ouch I hear you .. I have suffered from those for years.  They are no fun at all are they?. Are you getting any sort of treatment for it? There are some effective treatments out there..
text:I actually just talked to my doctor today, I am going to track my triggers and see if we can figure out why I am getting them. Also some meds for the symptoms.	labels:That sounds really productive. Do you think that the attacks might be stress related in some way?.
text:It could be but they seem to happen more on weekends so that doesn't really make sense.	labels:Hmm yes I can see how that does not make any sense. Do you have any other medical issues?.
text:No I am in pretty good health, a bit of sciatica from a few years back but that only flares up occasionally. .	labels:Well, I believe that there are some new advances in migraine treatment at the moment so I think things will improve for you. I am sorry if I am not being more help.. You sound as  though you are dealing with the problem pretty well though.
text:Thanks I knoq its pretty hard to fix medical issues with a conversation, I am also a little depressed if that helps:)	labels:Ah I hear you on that. Do you feel that this is related to the pandemic or is it something that has been ongoing for a while?.
text:No this is a very old friend.	labels:There are some excellent counselling services available if you are interested in going that route..
text:Honestly I have a pretty good handle on it, I have done a lot of therapy and I am quite open with people about it.	labels:That is a really healthy attitude to have. I think that you are dealing with this very well .. well done!. Back to migraines, have you considered trying to alter your diet to help with it? Some people believe that avoiding certain foods can be really helpful..
text:Yes I need to start keeping track of what triggers me, Caffeine is definitely off the menu because that sets it off for me.	labels:That's a shame - I would really miss caffeine if I had to do without it! I did try cutting out sugar but it did not really have any effect. I hope that you can find some resolution in the New Year. All the best to you and thanks for talking!.

text:Hi how are you ?	labels:I'm doing fine , how are you?
text:Doing ok, thanks .	labels:thats good what do you have planned for the holidays?
text:Not a whole lot due to the economic hardship my family and I are facing. How about you ? as far as holiday plans.	labels:I completely understand that i feel that pain as well. are you there?
text:oh I am sorry to hear that.	labels:it's ok there are plenty of other things that you can do with family during this time.
text:Thats true that should be the holiday spirit and keep hope alive.	labels:exactly so what else do you have planned are you ready for the new year?
text:Cook a good meal and spend time with my kids and spouse. Gifts wont be extravagant this year but I guess its the thought that counts.	labels:yes it's the thought that counts and being blessed to be around love ones.
text:Totally, thanks for that insight.	labels:I myself is going to enjoy good food and enjoy hopefully some decent winter weather. your welcome.
text:very nice, does it snow where you live ?	labels:no snow here the weather was really nice today high of 60 degrees. what about where you are at?
text:awesome. we are dealing with 60s ourselves. which is not too bad either.	labels:nice.
text:How was your thanksgiving ? were you able to invite others or was it just with family ? assuming you are in the US somewhere.	labels:Yes in the US , thanksgiving was just with close family members .	episode_done:True
text:How are you doing today?\nI'm doing alright. Just a little sad.	labels:I'm sorry to hear your sad. Is there anything I can do to help you?
text:Yeah, maybe just make a little sense of this craziness I'm going through.	labels:Sure, let's talk it out.
text:My girlfriend has this condition where she needs to drink formula everyday just to keep her brain working properly. And she keeps talking about the potential of kids. I freak out thinking that I could have her die and being left with kids.	labels:That's a valid concern and overwhelming to think about I'm sure. What is her prognosis?
text:Maple Syrup Urine Disease. Basically she can only have 7 grams of protein a day. If she gets more. That could result in severe brain damage.	labels:And is this something that she will die early because of?
text:Not exactly. It just means her liver can't metabolize three amino acids.	labels:So if she manages it she can live a relatively normal life?
text:Yes, for the most part. She still gets very clumsy and can is very prone to sickness getting very bad. So it has it's challenges. I just keep hearing about gene therapy for that I'm just at the point where I'm not I could go on if something horrible happens.	labels:Sure, I can see where it would be challenging and pregnancy would be scary. But I'd suggest discuss it with her doctor to see what they suggest.
text:Her doctor said for her. She has to give blood work all the time... Which for me is insane.	labels:As hard as it is to think about, you'd also have a piece of her.
text:I would probably be a shell of a person if something happens. I just always been terrified of children. I keep telling her but she wants like 3 kids.	labels:Do you simply not want kids? Because if she does and you don't, you can't blame it on her condition, that would be making her give up something that wouldn't be fair.
text:Yeah. I try making that clear. But no one wants her to die.	labels:I understand, you may need to have a hard conversation with her.
text:I don't really have an interest for them. Maybe I'll be there and love them the same at the time. But currently. I just don't see me being feeling any sort of way later. Yeah. I've told her like 20 times. I'm starting to think she can't process normally.	labels:Maybe you're not right for each other if you have such different views on this subject. Neither one of you should have to give in to something they don't want.
text:Well it's not like I actively don't want kids. I just don't want her to die. Or for the kids to die from something I can't control. I had so many siblings die. Seen what it did to my father. And he is not the same. I've been to so many funerals as a kid for young children in my family. I just don't see kids the same way anymore.	labels:Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living. Unfortunately it sounds like you've had a lot of experience with that, and I can understand that. I've been to my fair share as well. But you also can't live your life in fear or you're not really living. Or allowing her to live the life she wants as well.
text:I suppose that helps me cope. I want her to do what she likes. My mom had me out of the feeling of being lonely. And to be honest. It kind of feels like a worthless existence. She literally made me stay silent about going to a baby brother's funeral when I was a kid.	labels:Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. It sounds like you have someone who cares about you and wants a part of you to exist in another living being. I know you're scared and that's valid, but you have an opportunity to do things differently than what your mom did for you.
text:Yeah. I guess that is a better way to think. I don't want to extend that sadness to my own flesh and blood. Especially the person who values me so much. The doctors trust she can do it and I know medicine is getting better.	labels:But having gone through that yourself, you know exactly what NOT to do.
text:Everyone tells me that. Haha.	labels:Then it must be good advice lol.
text:I really appreciate the advice. I won't make someone else sad off of those experiences. I think people deserve better.	labels:You deserve better than thinking your feelings don't count for something. There are people that love you and want to listen and be a part of your life.
text:Yeah. My grand mother and older sister actively support me. I had an uncle that passed sadly but I know that feeling of love and support will never leave me.	labels:Good, I'm glad you have that support.
text:Well you have been an excellent support system.	labels:Thank you, I'm glad I was able to chat with you and wish you the best!
text:Of course, may you have a happy holiday.	labels:You as well!	episode_done:True
text:Salutations.\nhello.	labels:How r u. Glad to meet you.

text:i have friends and family who also suffers from job loss. hair braider.	labels:Wow that is a pretty awesome line of work. Is the state stopping you.
text:no i have to be within 6 feet to do their hair.	labels:The 6 foot rule is causing you a problem.
text:yes i have to be closer.	labels:What other type work do you do. Question for you.
text:none. but i am looking for work from home jobs.	labels:Are you able to visit people in their homes.
text:no.	labels:So you could not do house calls. I work from home. Have you thought about online work.
text:no i dont i want to be safe.	labels:That is very understandable.
text:yes i have but i need more info on how i get into that type of work.	labels:I do online work. I write plus copywrite. There are websites that enable you to find work from home.
text:thats nice what the name of the website.	labels:I could name a company that has multiple listings.
text:o please do that would be wonderful. and thank you.	labels:There is a website called Dream Work from Home. She is on you tube also and tells you more about her program.
text:ok thank you.	labels:She has positions especially for women.
text:ok awesome.	labels:Her program is free and she updates it 4 times a week.
text:whats her name.	labels:She helps you find companies.
text:ok i will look her up on youtube.	labels:Her name is Denise.
text:ok.	labels:She is a very awesome lady.
text:kool.	labels:all of her work can be from home.
text:did she start off doing that or was she employed by another company.	labels:She has over 100 companies that are hiring. It is here company.
text:ok  thats great.	labels:you can also wfh even if your shop reopens.
text:im going to check her out on youtube .	labels:Yes. She will tell you all about her program and where to apply.
text:yes i can but i will have to reduce the amount of clients i have.	labels:There is always an alternative to our work.
text:yes there is.	labels:But if you go back to work, you can always change what hours you work from home. Even part-time as a side job.	episode_done:True
text:Hello! How are you feeling today?\nStarted out ok but now I am so angry and depressed.	labels:Can I ask why you feel angry and depressed? Can I ask why you feel angry and depressed?
text:As I explained, had a fight with my preteen son.	labels:It sounds like you are frustrated. Do you mind sharing what the fight was about?
text:I told him to work on maths worksheet and he did but not very concentrated.  I tried to help him and asked him to neatly write out the formula but then he just started raging and yelling at me. Then he said he has no life after he had played video games for like 3 hours.	labels:I am sorry to hear that you two fought! What made you feel that he was not concentrating on his homework? Does he often struggle with homework?
text:he just didn't like doing things sometimes. but generally is fine.	labels:It sounds like you feel he has a loss of motivation towards school work, is this correct?
text:no, he just didn't want to be told what to do. very emotional these days for kids.	labels:Alright, so you feel he has an issue with following instructions? Have you ever tried disciplinary action like taking away video games when he feels he does not want to listen to you?.
text:Yes I did.  But no point, he just upset on things like didn't get to be with his friends, or having no friends, no life etc.	labels:Do you feel he could possibly be depressed?.
text:I think so. But so am I .	labels:It must be even harder during times of the virus!
text:Yes.	labels:I am sorry to hear that, have you thought about seeing a counselor through the internet?
text:yes may be i have to reach out for his school counseler. thanks for listening .	labels:I think that is a very nice idea. I also might suggest finding activities that you both could enjoy and spend time together. Maybe finding a show you both could enjoy will open up room for a greater connection! It could also help both of you feeling lonely during these hard times!
text:Thanks... I need to find some motivation to do so as well...	labels:Do you have any self-care activities that you enjoy doing? This could help feelings of depression. Even taking some time out of the week to do something you enjoy can help lift up one's mood.
text:I don't have much hobbies but I tried to stay active like going to swim, doing yoga, reading books.  So I kept myself busy already but more for the sake of getting my mind of things, like people playing video games and watching tv.	labels:Well I am glad to hear that you have some activities you enjoy! In relation to your son, how do you feel when he plays video games constantly?
text:He usually is ok but now is holiday I let him play more but got even worst! As if playing games made him even more depressed.	labels:Have you ever thought about using the video games as an incentive. For example, if he finishes his homework, he can play for two hours or something?
text:Yes he usually only play after he finished all his homework on school days. But now school is out I just let him play whenever. But it doesn't make him happier.	labels:It is good to hear that the video games did not get in the way of him completing his work. Do you have any other ideas as to what hobbies makes him happy or interested?
text:I don't know whatelse he wanted to do.  It is like he didn't really have a preference. . Thanks for listening.	labels:I think starting with the school counselor is a great idea, I feel she will have more of an idea of how your son functions in school and maybe give ideas to helping his mood.. Yes, no problem! I hope you can find a solution to helping your son.	episode_done:True
text:hello.	labels:Hello there. How are you feeling today?.
text:Im feeling a little down.	labels:I am really sorry to hear that. Is it something specific that you'd like to talk about?.
text:Yes I am being dismissed from medical school.	labels:I am really sorry to hear that! Is it related to the pandemic or have you doing badly in your exams?.
text:i am currently in the appeals process but i havent left the house in a weeks. yes my child was having suicidal thoughts so my attention went there.	labels:Please try not to worry. Do you have someone to advocate for you in the appeals process?.
text:no its all on me.	labels:I think you should look into getting an advocate. You have a legal entitlement to have representation..
text:because of the holidays it will be kind of pointless. they will probably see my cause a few days before the scheduled meeting.	labels:Ah I do understand. I have been frustrated when things grind to a halt at this time of year too. Can you ask for an extension on your appeal time?.
text:No extensions allowed. but thank you for your suggestions.	labels:That sounds very harsh, especially given the current situation. I suggest that you find out where you stand legally because I am sure that this can't be right.
text:Yes i believe so, i am currently looking into alternatives as far as future career goals.	labels:I can tell you are feeling really hopeless and anxious right now. Do you have any fun plans for the season?.
text:i am feeling both honestly i do have plans but do not want to go.	labels:I think it would be a good idea to try to coax yourself into going. You will probably enjoy it when you get there :).
text:i have been to a few trips visiting family i did not really enjoy myself i want to be alone. that is my current problem. i think i am depressed.	labels:Have you considered speaking to your doctor? You might benefit from some medication or counselling..
text:i am currently on medication i suffer from severe depression.	labels:I am sorry. I suffer from depression also and am on medication so I can understand your pain..
text:Thank you. its very hard.	labels:Unfortunately the current global situation is not helping any of us. It is terrible to feel scared all the  time..
text:This is true. thank you I feel a little better knowing im not the only one going through this.	labels:Perhaps you could make a list of things that you mean to do in the New Year to give you something to focus on?.
text:thats a good idea actually. I use to have a journal but havent wrote in it for years. it helped a lot.	labels:Make sure to only choose realistic goals so's not to make yourself feel despondent and do not be too hard on yourself if something does not work out!. A journal is a fantastic idea. You can track your personal progress over a period of time..
text:Thank you youre right i put too much on myself.	labels:Unfortunately, depression does mean that we can judge ourselves far too harshly. I have been guilty of that myself in the past..
text:Yes it has bothered me for years and its like a weight on my shoulders.	labels:I hope I have been able to be of some comfort to you and given you something to think about. Have a lovely Christmas!.
text:you too and thank you again.	labels:Take care!.

I was also in that shoe, but you can try to move close to someone you think knows the course very well.
text:yes i am very anxious and scared.	labels:you have done best so far, you need to get rid of that fear to understand the course. You can even go online, like download some videos about the course, it will tutor you and really be of help. hello.
text:yes i will try and download some video tutorial on youtube maybe that will help.	labels:definitely, it will be of help.
text:ok thanks for the advice.	labels:get your courage back, do not give room for fear. you are welcome,.
text:yea, will try and do that.	labels:I wish you the best luck.

text:My family is allover the country. no family near me.	labels:Are there some in the South?
text:I am in Georgia trying to go to Florida. My family is up north.	labels:Is there a reason you're trying to get further away from family?
text:I am trying to start and settle down. I am single/divorced and want to start fresh. My family knows that. I am older.	labels:That sounds like a good idea then. Meet someone to settle down with and get through this with.
text:That is my goal. Also get to teh beach.	labels:I'm in the North, so anything outdoors sounds nice right about now.
text:I used to live up north but the cold got to me.	labels:It's definitely not for everyone. Amazing how temperature can mess with your mood as well. Something about sun and sand can really put you in a good mood.
text:i grew up in the snow country.	labels:Same here, we have snow on the ground and negative temps projected for later in the week.
text:I heard. I was heading north but the weather stopped me.	labels:Are you spending the holidays with anyone if you're not heading north?
text:no the virus stopped it. I will be alone and not anyone around.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that, this is such a crazy year for everyone. I'm sorry to hear you'll be alone. Have you ever considered volunteering?
text:not where I am at. Just staying low because of the virus.	labels:It's smart to be safe.
text:Where I am the virus isn't bad. Just hoping to get to Florida soon.	labels:Maybe you can do some research on areas and places to move during the holidays. Look forward to when you can sit on the beach.
text:I have been but I can't plan a date until the 1st.	labels:That's coming up pretty quick though so that's good.

text:Hello?	labels:Hey, hi are you doing today?
text:I'm okay i guess. How are you?	labels:I'm pretty good, I can't complain. Is there any thing going on with your life that you would like to discuss?
text:My marriage recently fell apart and i had to relocate to NC with my children. That's going as well as you would think it is.	labels:I know separation isn't easy, especially with children involved. How are you coping with this transition?.
text:I guess im okay, a little shaky and still find myself in tears from time to time. Honestly it is nothing new for me. I've suffered from depressions since i was a young teen.	labels:Well breakup is not easy so what you're feeling is normal. Have you ever sought out professional help for depression?
text:Yes I go to the local mental health. I'm actually bipolar 1 which kinda makes my depression a little worse. I see a counselor twice a month. I still however have some trouble in between visits. I just can not afford to be seen more often..	labels:Are there hobbies or activities that you do that help you cope with issues such as jogging, reading, etc.?
text:I read a lot and play rpg games to distract myself. My kids are a big help too. ill admit there are some days despite trying to distract myself i stuggle..	labels:Its good to see that you have activities you participate in that helps you cope. I also play video games to just get away mentally too. But yes, even hobbies are not the cure for issue but rather helps with the symptoms.
text:Oh really what kinda video games to you escape into? I like RPG, romance, adventure, and simulation.	labels:I love to play shooters and sports lol. I will be getting into the VR world very soon.
text:Oh i love some shooters. But VR scares me honestly. I heard it can cause seizures.	labels:I'm scared as well as it may feel too realistic for me..
text:Yea god forbid playing a shooter in VR O.o.	labels:hahaha...Have you tslked to family and friends about the situation? How did they respond and what suggestions did they offer?
text:Well my mama suggested i just forget my ex and not be depressed. My grandpa suggested once i get divorced i should just move on. My brother asked if i wanted him to beat his ass XD lol So not much help honestly.	labels:Do you want the relationship to be over or you are truly done and want to move on?
text:I realize i am glad its over. I realize i did not love him like i thought i did. I'm sad that my babies had to suffer for me to realize this.	labels:Although it's tough for the children, it's positive to hear that maybe it was for the best. The family seemed to echo your same feelings so it could be for the best.
text:I certainly hope so. I wonder sometimes. I hope i haven't ruined my kids lives by leaving their father.	labels:Some children may act out if they have trouble expressing how they feel. I would suggest having regular talks with them and being transparent.
text:Yes we had a little trouble with my 8 year old. He thought i and his grandma chased his daddy away. He acted out a lot till we set down with him and explained what happened.	labels:Oh wow, well its good that an explanation was there for him to understand. As time goes on, it will become easier.
text:I sure hope so. Thanks so much for your time. You really made me feel better about the situation. I actually enjoyed this hit.	labels:No problem, the pleasure was all mines!
text:^-^ have a good day sugar!	labels:You too, thanks!	episode_done:True

text:i'm fine. how are you doing too?	labels:Im glad to hear that. I am doing well today, thank you for asking! Is there something on your mind you'd like to chat about?  I'm here to listen.
text:i had a breakup just a year ago and its taking its toll on me.	labels:I'm sorry to hear that. Recovering from a break up can take a long time. How long were you together?
text:4 years.	labels:That is a long time.  I think its normal to take time to recover after a long relationship, after all it was a significant part of your life for 4 years.  .
text:yes, we were both planning on getting married.	labels:I've struggled with the same situation. Do you want to tell me what kind of feelings you are struggling with?. That is a lot to deal with, I am so sorry.
text:i am very saddened by the breakup.	labels:I  hear and feel  your grief.   Would you call it grief?  Please let me know.
text:close to grief but she is still alive. i saw her last week and it was like a bomb was dropped on me.	labels:i understand. Grief is the emotion of sadness and loss, does that resonate with you?  .
text:exactly.	labels:I was just going to ask you if you  still see her, that must have been so difficult. .
text:very difficult. she looks soo beautiful.	labels:The hollidays were very hard for me after my break up, we were going to marry like you.  Isort the season and all the expectations and memories of exacerbated the loss for me. Do you think that might be making you feel worse?  . Have you considered that You must be beautiful/handsome for her to be attracted to you.
text:i think our problem started when we moved in together. i always felt soo lucky to have her because she is always perfect.	labels:I just want to say that the hollidays will be over soon and that may help. I'm sorry, it sounds like you loved her very much.
text:i loved her just too much. and the holiday is not helping the matter because i felt soo lonely.	labels:Experts say that feeling your feelings and talking about them is really good for you to help get over a long breakup.  Also that it takes a year or more to process.  So know that you are doing the right things.
text:really.	labels:I was really lonely after my breakup too.  I had to make myself spend time with other people that cared about me like friends and family.  Even though I kind of just wanted to stay sad making myself be around other people that reminded me of the good, perfect and lovable things about myself made me feel better and gave me hope. Maybe easing your lonliness would give you some relief?.
text:so you are advising me to go out more and mixed up with people.	labels:You sound like a sensitive and loving person.  Those are wonderful qualities.  I noticed them and we are strangers.  I'm sure you have many more.
text:you are soo kind.	labels:It sounds like you don't feel like going out?
text:i dont know what i think of my self really. i rally dont feel like going anywhere.	labels:It's normal to feel the way you do as  you sort out what happened and how to go forward.
text:ok. i will do that. thanks.	labels:If you dont feel like being around people, what really helped me was reminding myself of the good things about myself. Sometimes I even made a list so I didn't forget.  And staying distracted sometimes helped too.  Experts say coming up with some goal or project really helps. .
text:ok, thats a good idea.	labels:There are also so many articles and support on the internet, don't be afraid to just search "getting over a relationship" or 'bad breakup advice"  there are so many people that have gone through this. Ypu are not alone. I know that nothing I say can take away your pain or make it not have happened, but I care that you have these feelings and I care about you. .
text:thanks, i will check them out. thanks for the show of love.	labels:you are welcome.  i hope you feel supported and encouraged.  I know this will get better for you.  take care of and love yourself, friend. you are worth it..
text:i will do that. thanks.	labels:and one last thing that worked for me was when I was really fixated on how perfect my ex was, i'd make a list of why they weren't and why we weren't good together.  It made me think in a more balanced way.
text:really, and it worked? i will try that.	labels:yeah, it did work.  even when all could see was how great my ex was i could at least see why we didn't work and i wanted us both to be happy so writing that stuff helped me keep it in perspective.  Its been a privilege listening to you . i'm wishing you all good things.
text:oh, thanks. thanks for the advice. i will work on it. bye.	labels:you're welcome. don't be afraid to reach out to others in this time, you are valuable.  i hope you have a good rest of the week. . bye.	episode_done:True
text:Hello. How can I help you today ?\nWhat should I do.	labels:Tell me about the situation that you are facing.
text:I try to find a job but there is not many.	labels:I am sorry to hear that. How long have you been looking?
text:About 6 months.	labels:I understand that there are a lot of job loss in the Covid time. Is your job seeking related to that? Yeah it must be very difficult..
text:yes.	labels:I was applying for jobs for almost a year, and I got an offer in February right before coronavirus. I can definitely relate to you.. I am glad that Mechanical Turk can provide an intermediate method of earning income. I am also using the platform to earn some extra cash to support family..
text:I don't know what types of jobs that fit me. yeah, but it is still rough to get by.	labels:Tell me more about it if you don't mind. What kind of academic and professional background do you have, and what kind of positions are you seeking?
text:I worked in manufacturer. technical skill in trade school but not degree from college.	labels:I see. Would you ideally want to work for a manufacturer company instead of settling down for something temporary while seeking a more matched position?
text:I will seek for another jobs if possible but I can work on manufacturer company too.	labels:I understand. Do you have location requirements, for instance, you would prefer working remotely instead of in person in the Covid time?.
text:If I can work remotely I will do it.	labels:I have been browsing job boards every now and then. There are consistently some grocery store jobs, or cashier jobs. If you don't mind the location, I am sure you would  be a good fit for these.
text:The job market is very competitive. I tried but there are no responds after my interview.	labels:I completely understand. I was looking for jobs for almost a year. I have a spreadsheet that keeps track of all the jobs I applied. Maybe only 2 or 3 percent of them replied (with an interview request, etc.) I would suggest trying applying for jobs via Linkedin, or google jobs. You can sort them by posted date. My experience is that the more recent the posting date is, the more likely they will review your application..
text:Thanks, I will try more on the website you suggest.	labels:Previously I also registered in a few temp agencies  that would place me in companies with the intension of only keeping in on board for a few months/weeks. They can be a good gap filler as well.
text:Do they charge you when you get a job?	labels:I hope I can be more helpful. I really sympathize with your situation.. They would just terminate me after they have found a permanent employee on an ongoing basis. In rare situations, they would hire "temp-to-hire" with the expectation of hiring temp workers.
text:Thank you, there are no many availability of what I can do and it is just out of control from nowhere.	labels:Thank you for reaching out. It really shows that you care and you are working towards the goal. I hope you succeed..
text:Thank you for your kindness.	labels:Happy holidays and best wishes to you.	episode_done:True
text:Hello.	labels:Hello, how are you?
text:Not good.	labels:What's wrong, do you feel like sharing?
text:Well, my girlfriend and her grandmother are extremely depressed. The husband of her grandfather is driving everyone nuts with his yelling. Nothing makes him happy.	labels:I am so sorry to hear that. Sounds like your girlfriend and her grandmother could use some time away from her grandfather..
text:Kind of hard when he is the one that owns the houses. Doesn't seem right to leave him. He is going through dementia right now. He always supported them. Just sucks now he is causing so much sadness. He sees me like a son but end of the day. I have to do right by my girlfriend. I love her and her family.	labels:His dementia is causing him to become upset? Your right he does need to be around family and needs love and support, and you are not doing wrong being on your girlfriend side.
text:Yeah. He keeps going to the VA and they keep saying he is losing brain mass. Wish everyone else knew how to deal with him. Doesn't seem like everyone is equipped to deal with this kind of stress. My girlfriend already has enough on her plate with her chronic illness. Mostly the arguing starts when he tells her to eat 'normal' food. Which everyone has to keep reminding can kill her.	labels:Is there any way you guys could get a nurse that deals with patients that have dementia to help him out?
text:Well, problem is that he is extremely fit and stubborn. That could be a solution. Not in his current state though... He would lose his mind. He is a veteran... so. He could lose it.	labels:What about getting a nurse, would make him lose his mind? It would be in his best interest to help him and others around him.
text:He thinks everyone is out to get him. He was in Vietnam for years and left him with guns without ammo to protect a post. So with that in mind... who knows. Could work out. But he has tackled medical personnel before. You could imagine the trauma that encourages that crazy mindset. However, I think I got a good idea what to suggest. At least to my girlfriend and her family. You left I guess. Interesting. Okay. well good bye. Man.. not even a proper good bye.	labels:im so sorry im still here if you would like to talk.	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you doing today?\ngood. How about you? Is there any idea about  covid20.	labels:I am doing well. Thanks for asking. It is really nice outside today..
text:Recently  identified in london.	labels:Hopefully soon cases will be lowered due to the vaccine. How are you feeling about COVID?
text:Is that vaccine will help to control the new variant of corona.	labels:I think so. I have my fingers crossed.. How are you feeling during this pandemic?.
text:It was very hectic time for me .Initially we were scared to go to even grocery. Afterwards we are trained our self using safety measures.	labels:I understand. I have also been on edge during these times, one thing I did do is take all the precautions I could to ease my anxiety..
text:Yeah. That's looking good.  Do u have any idea about side effects of the vaccine, Is it safe for kids? Are you working in frontline?	labels:I am unsure at the moment. As the weeks continue I am sure we will hear more about the side effects. How are you coping during these times?.
text:I am remotely working. I never go outside unnecessarily.	labels:I am not. Are you? I am very appreciative of those front line workers, I often think about how hard it might be to be in their position.
text:Definitely.	labels:One thing I do during my time at home (because we spend so much time at home) is to do yoga. It really helps stabilize my mood and be stress free from the virus. There are several of free Youtube that are amazing!.
text:Sure.I am also practicing now a days.Thanks for your valuable time you spend with me.Bit rexation for me.	labels:Of course anytime! I wish you the best. On the bright side, everything will hopefully get better soon. Very nice to talk to you as well..
text:Thank you..	labels:Thank you! Have a great rest of your day..	episode_done:True
text:Hello, how are you today?\nI'm doing ok.	labels:That's good to hear. Is there anything that you would like to talk about?
text:Yes, me and my partner are considering breaking up as she wants to move to another state to be with her cousin and have a fresh start. I want to stay and be around my family. So that is the dilemma.	labels:So it sounds to me like you're experiencing stress about choosing between staying in your current relationship, or staying close to your family. Do I have that right?
text:Yes and its very hard for me to make a decision on which to choose.	labels:I can understand how that feels. Anybody would have a hard time deciding between those options. May I ask you a question about your relationship?
text:Yes, sure.	labels:Compared to other relationships that you've had in the past, how strongly do you feel about this one?
text:I would say compared to every relationship I have had, this is the best relationship I have been in. Plus we have children involved.	labels:That helps me understand that this is quite a problem, however talking to you now I feel like you can trust yourself to eventually reach the best decision.. Have you talked this out with your family and your partner together?
text:I think that after speaking with you, I realize the choice I must make though difficult. And yes we have talked with everyone close with us or connected.	labels:How did that go? Did everybody feel like they had their voice heard in a cooperative manner?
text:I feel like everyone respected both of our wishes as they were different but everyone also offered advice and shared their experiences. Everyone was cooperative.	labels:So you had a cooperative conversation, but not a very productive one, is that right?
text:Yes we listened to each other but it was still a more agree to disagree conversation. No over talking or arguments.	labels:I understand how those conversations go, believe me we all have them. They don't seem to solve much a first, but we better off doing it than not..
text:Yes I have come to understand that we must have those hard conversations rather than avoiding it. Thanks for the talk!	labels:You're welcome, I hope you have a better understanding of the problem now.
text:I do now that I have talked it through.	labels:That's good to hear, may I ask how the weather is today?	episode_done:True
text:How are you today?\nI'm doing pretty good.	labels:I'm glad to hear you're doing well in these trying times.
text:Yah they are very difficult.	labels:How have you been managing everything?
text:Fine I've been pretty much just trying to go out as little as possible and stay safe.	labels:Same here, it's a tough time to do that after doing it so long. Especially with the holidays coming up.
text:Yes I would have to agree.	labels:Are you in close proximity to your family?
