seeker: Hi, there.
supporter: How are you friend?
seeker: I'm feeling emotionally sad right now.
supporter: I'm so sorry to hear that. Why are you feeling sad?
seeker: While, I broke up with my boyfriend 6 months ago. And I still could get myself out of it.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that, too. It sounds like you're struggling with the emotions that come with a breakup. That can be very difficult and take a while to get over.
seeker: Yeah. I just feel so difficult to face everything in my life now. It seems that I'm not needed by anyone in the world.
supporter: I know that this might sound personal, but it's completely normal to have these feelings after a breakup. Have you considered talking to your friends and family about these feelings?
seeker: Well, I thought about that. But I think that will only make them worry about me. You know, because of the pandemic, I'm at home by myself.
supporter: I understand. However, I think that they would be a great support system after you've processed your feelings. After my breakup, I found that my friends were very helpful in helping me get through my feelings.
seeker: Yeah, I understand that. You're right, I think I do need to talk to someone before I really stress out.
supporter: I think that's a great idea. I also found that writing out my feelings in a journal helped me a lot..
seeker: That looks like a super nice idea. What kind of things do you wirte about?
supporter: I wrote down how I felt about the relationship and how it affected my life. I also wrote down things I could do to help myself feel better. I ended up finding a lot of helpful tips on reddit and other places!.
seeker: Ah, that is really helpful. I probably could also find some useful tips from the internet. There might also be some methods to help me forget about it.
supporter: Yes, there are so many ways to get help with this. I am so glad I was able to talk to you about this!.
seeker: Thanks a lot for the suggestions. That really helps.
supporter: You are so welcome! I am glad I was able to help!.
