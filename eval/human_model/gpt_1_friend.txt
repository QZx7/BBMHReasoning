seeker: Hi, there.
supporter: Hello, how may i help you today?
seeker: So, I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.
supporter: I am sorry to hear that. Did you do something wrong?
seeker: I really don't think so. I just refused to hang out during the pandemic. You know, it could be dangerous. I did that for her own sake.
supporter: I understand that you did not want to put her in danger, but I think that you should have talked to her about it.
seeker: I tried, but as you could see. She just blocked me. And now I can't get contact to her anymore.
supporter: I understand that she might need some time to herself, but I think that you should try to reach out to her again.
seeker: I am not sure about it. It was her fault and she said I was a selfish person. Well, she was the selfish one I would say.
supporter: I think that she might still be able to help you if you give her another chance.
seeker: I just can't contact her anymore. But you know, the whole just made me feel so upset and angry. I really want to forget about it but I just can not.
supporter: I understand how you feel. I would be pretty upset as well.
seeker: Right? I feel so tired about this whole thing. I don't know how can I get this out of my mind.
supporter: I know, it's been a really crazy year. I can't believe how many things have happened.
seeker: Yeah, it seems that people have changed a lot because of the pandemic. It's frustrating.
supporter: I know, it's really been frustrating. But I know you can get through this!.
seeker: I don't know, i will try to. I should probably think of a way to relax myself a little bit.
supporter: I think that's a great idea! Maybe take your mind off of things by talking to someone you trust.
seeker: That sounds like a good idea. I should probably have video calls with some friends.
supporter: That sounds like a great idea! Video calls are so helpful.
seeker: Yeah, they do. It's really helpful when you can't meet face to face, but still want to keep in touch with each other. 
supporter: I'm glad it did!
seeker: Thanks! It was nice talking to you.
supporter: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help!
