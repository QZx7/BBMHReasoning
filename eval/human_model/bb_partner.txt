seeker: Hi, there.
supporter: Hello, how are you doing today? I am doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?
seeker: Thanks for asking. Actually, I feel emotionally sad recently.
supporter: I am sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any hobbies?
seeker: My boyfriend broke up with me about months ago without saying goodbye face to face, that really made me feel bad.
supporter: Oh, I am so sorry that happened to you. I am sure you will find someone better.
seeker: Thanks for saying that. I just want to know why. He could have told me the reason. But there is just no single word from him.
supporter: I know how you feel. I have been broken up with before and it is the worst feeling in the world.
seeker: Yeah, that's true, especially when you don't know the reason. It just came all out of a sudden.
supporter: That is exactly how it was for me. It was out of the blue. I hope you feel better soon.
seeker: Yeah, I just don't know what to do. I tried to get this out of my mind. But I just can't focus on anything. It really bothers me.
supporter: I know what you mean. It will take some time to get over it but you will get there.
seeker: I think there might be some methods to help me quickly recover from it. But I don't know how.
supporter: I'm sure you will find something that works for you. Just take it one day at a time.
seeker: Yeah, I'm trying to take it step by step. Maybe as you said, time could fix everything.
supporter: That's a good idea. I wish you the best of luck. You will get through this.
seeker: Thanks anyway.
supporter: You're welcome. If you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to message me.
