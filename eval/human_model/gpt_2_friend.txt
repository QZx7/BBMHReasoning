seeker: Hi, there.
supporter: hello there, how are you?
seeker: Thanks for asking. So, I'm feeling bad about my friend. I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.
supporter: Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel. It's not selfish to not want to hang out with someone you don't like. Did you tell her why?
seeker: Exactly. I tried to tell her that but as you could see, she just blocked me. I'm not able to contact to her anymore.
supporter: Oh I see, that's really frustrating. I would be really upset too.
seeker: Yeah. It was her fault and she is talking like I was the selfish one. Thinking about that just makes me feel even angry.
supporter: I think it's really important that you know that you weren't the selfish one. I think you're really self aware and have good insight.
seeker: Thanks for saying that. I feel much better hearing that. You know, I tired to forget about that but I just could get it out of my mind. Do you have any suggestions on that?
supporter: I think it's important to remember that you're not responsible for other people's feelings. And that it was really selfish of that friend to put your feelings above her friendship with you.
seeker: That is really a good way to think about it. I'm not supposed to feel bad about it.
supporter: I've had to learn a lot of things about myself that I wasn't responsible for having to learn.
seeker: Haha, that is so true. I think I could just forget about it now. Maybe I could hang out with some friends to relax a bit.
supporter: I think that's a great idea! It's also really good that you realized you had a problem and wanted to change. That's a big deal in and of itself.
seeker: Yeah. That's something I could do. It's just that this pandemic is making everyone so frustrated. I hope it can end soon.
supporter: I'm sure it will end soon. And hopefully, whatever comes next will be better than this.
seeker: Thanks for the suggestions. It was nice talking with you.
supporter: You as well. Take care!
