seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hi there! How are you? I'm just relaxing after a long day at the office.
seeker: Oh, that's good for you. I'm not feeling well though...
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any plans for the weekend?
seeker: No, I don't have plans. I don't feel good because of a friend. I refused to hang out with her because of the Covid. And she felt that I am a selfish person and blocked me from everything.
supporter: I'm so sorry that happened to you. You shouldn't have to put up with that kind of behavior.
seeker: Yeah, I tried to reach out to her to tell her that she was the selfish one. But she blocked me..      
supporter: That's unfortunate. Hopefully you can find someone better to spend time with in the future.
seeker: I don't know. I don't think she is a person like this. That is really bothering me.
supporter: I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you find someone who treats you better.
seeker: Yeah, maybe I should try to talk to some friends. Hopefully that will make me feel better.
supporter: Yes, I think that would be a good idea. Friends are always good to have.
seeker: Yeah, recently we are not able to hang out often due to the pandemic. 
supporter: I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any other friends you can hang out with?
seeker: Yeah, maybe we could have a online party through video calls.
supporter: That sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to be a part of something like that.
seeker: That sounds good. I will let you know later. 
supporter: I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great evening. Take care of yourself. :)
