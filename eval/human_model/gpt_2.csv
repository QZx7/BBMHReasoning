"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: hi, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am good, how are you feeling?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm doing ok. Just I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see, do you have people you can talk to about this? Friends, family?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I'm not sure if my parents could help me or not. I don't want to make them worry, either.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see. Do you think that you are making things worse by not talking to them? I know that I was very hesitant to talk to my family about some things, but I found that they were very helpful.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is that so? Maybe I should try. Well, you know, I can't sleep and feel it's hard to concentrate for quite a long time. It's really bothering me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that very well. Have you tried meditating or practicing mindfulness? It really helps me with my concentration issues.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, that sounds like something could be useful! But I don't know how to meditate? Is there any instruction on that?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: There are many different techniques, but I like the guided meditation apps. They have a lot of great instructions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, that sounds great. So, I can jsut download that app on my phone and it will teach me how to do meditation. Is that correct?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, that is correct. I use one that has a bunch of different sounds, and it tells you to breathe in an out. The sounds change as you get closer and closer to falling asleep. It is very soothing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That really sounds like something can calm me down. I would definitely try it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am glad I could help. Is there anything else you would like to talk about?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, that's probably all about it. Thanks for your good suggestions, I will start doing meditation from tomorrow.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are more than welcome. I hope you have a lovely festive season..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, you too."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: hello there, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for asking. So, I'm feeling bad about my friend. I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel. It's not selfish to not want to hang out with someone you don't like. Did you tell her why?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly. I tried to tell her that but as you could see, she just blocked me. I'm not able to contact to her anymore.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh I see, that's really frustrating. I would be really upset too.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. It was her fault and she is talking like I was the selfish one. Thinking about that just makes me feel even angry.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it's really important that you know that you weren't the selfish one. I think you're really self aware and have good insight.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for saying that. I feel much better hearing that. You know, I tired to forget about that but I just could get it out of my mind. Do you have any suggestions on that?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it's important to remember that you're not responsible for other people's feelings. And that it was really selfish of that friend to put your feelings above her friendship with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is really a good way to think about it. I'm not supposed to feel bad about it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I've had to learn a lot of things about myself that I wasn't responsible for having to learn.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Haha, that is so true. I think I could just forget about it now. Maybe I could hang out with some friends to relax a bit.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a great idea! It's also really good that you realized you had a problem and wanted to change. That's a big deal in and of itself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. That's something I could do. It's just that this pandemic is making everyone so frustrated. I hope it can end soon.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure it will end soon. And hopefully, whatever comes next will be better than this.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the suggestions. It was nice talking with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You as well. Take care!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry. I can understand how you are feeling.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, in the first few months, it was kind of alright. I was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel, I have been looking for a job for almost a year now.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, so, you are also unemployed? That's so bad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, I am. I have a BA in English and I want to work in the public sector.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, is that so? Well, I have tried some job websites alongside with job centers in the town. But they didn't help me much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: What is your field of work?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I work as a salesperson for a factory.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see. Have you talked to your advisor about this?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, technically, I don't have an advisor. I tried to visit some job websites, but I did not get much help. And the thing I'm worrying about is that I probably can't afford the rent for next month.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see. Have you talked to your landlord?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I don't think that's gonna help much. I probably have to move out.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. I had a similar situation when the pandemic first started. I was so anxious about the possibility of losing my apartment.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, how did you solve that in the end?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I had to move back in with my parents. It was very hard, but I managed to find a new job pretty quickly. Have you been looking for another job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, that sounds like a great idea. Maybe I will also have to bother my parents. But I don't want them to think that I'm a useless person.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think they would rather you bother them than not bother them and leave them wondering what is going on.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, that is so true. Maybe I could just borrow a room from them and as long as I could find a job fast, it should be fine.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sure they would not think you were useless if you were looking for a job and had a resume ready. I think they would be more worried about you than you worrying about bothering them.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, thanks for the explanation. That makes me feel much better. I think I know what to do now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am glad it does :D. I am sure you will be fine!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks! It's nice talking with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: It was nice talking to you as well! Take care!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, I am sorry to hear that. What is bothering you today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no, I am sorry to hear that. How long will you be away from your family?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: In total 2 weeks, and still 10 days to go.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That is a long time, I am sure you are feeling a bit lonely. Do you have any friends close by that you can talk to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I can only stay by myself according to the rules. But I could do video chats with my wife and kids. That really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That would be a great way to help relieve some stress from your situation. I am sure your family would love to have you around for as long as you can.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I would like to stay with them, too. You know, it just started to get worse as I started to have symptoms. I start to have fever and caughing. Eh, it just feels bad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to get some rest and feel better soon!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I am basically trying to sleep as much as possible. I don't know when can I recover from it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest doing that as long as you can. Try to get some rest and feel better soon!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, that probably is the only thing I can do now. I just want the Covid to end quickly.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that completely. The Covid is making everything so stressful.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it is really frustrating. I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine. Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad that you are able to see the positive aspects of the vaccine.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm really hoping it could help us out. You know, from time to time, we have to stay positive.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure it will.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, thanks a lot for talking with me. That makes me feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. I hope you have a great day.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You, too!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm feeling emotionally sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm really sorry to hear that. What's going on?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh my gosh, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel so bad. You know, we have been together for 3 years and I really love him. I just don't know why all out of a sudden..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. It's a really strange thing to happen, isn't it? I've been through something similar in the past. It's really hard. Have you tried to talk to him about it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. It's really hard to talk about things like this. I hope that things will get better for you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so, too. With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel. I also have problems with social anxiety and it's really hard for me to go out and socialize. It makes me feel depressed too.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, everything just made me feel so bad, both the breakup and the social problems. I just don't know hat to do now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know, right? It's so hard to go out and socialize. But we have to or we'll never get better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you think going out can makes me feel better?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it might, just to get out of the house and make some new friends.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Emm, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe I should try going out and reset my mind.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that would definitely help!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, that's something I can do. Thanks for the suggestion.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you should try to talk to him and let him know how you feel.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I will try when I feel better. I just don't want to see him now. Maybe after a while, I can get better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that, but I think you should do it now, before it gets too far in the future.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you think that might help to change his mind?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes I think that it might, but it's a really hard situation to be in.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, I see. I will try then. But as you said, I won't push myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should try to talk to him and let him know how you feel.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, thanks for your suggestion.<br>
