seeker: I'm feeling emotionally sad.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that, what's going on?
seeker: Yeah.. My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago without saying goodbye face to face. it is just making me wonder why?
supporter: I can understand how you feel, that would make you feel betrayed, did he give you a reason for the break up?
seeker: No, not at all. He didn't even give a single word. That's something I'm really upset with.
supporter: I can understand how you feel, I would be upset to, especially if he was with you for a long time.
seeker: Yeah, we have been together for about 3 years. And I think everything is going well. I just don't know wht happened all out of a sudden.
supporter: I would say that it probably happened out of the blue, that is usually the case with sudden breakups.
seeker: What do you mean by that? So, you meant he's got some mental issue?
supporter: Yes, I mean that he probably has some mental issues that he needs to deal with.
seeker: Hmm, I didn't notice that. If that's the case, I feel so guilty because I'm supposed to know that immediately.
supporter: I think that it is probably best to just let him come to his own conclusions about the break up and not try to get him to talk to you about it.
seeker: So, you mean I should leave him alone, right now? 
supporter: I think that is a good idea. You should take some time to yourself and think about what you want to do.
seeker: Yeah, I also think pushing him too much now is not a good idea. Maybe after a while, he will come to me again.
supporter: I think that is a good plan. It is also good that you are thinking about your feelings.
seeker: Well, I know that I love him. Although we don't have a lot of things in common, I do think he is a good person.
supporter: I understand that you love him. That is a very strong feeling to have and I am sure that he knows that you love him too. It is also good to know that he is a good person. Do you think that maybe you are feeling sad because you don't have a reason to be happy?
seeker: Yeah, of course. I feel bad for him if he really suffers from some bad experience. I should have known them much earlier. 
supporter: I understand that mental illness is a very difficult thing to deal with. It can affect anyone in a significant way. I hope that he will be able to get the help that he needs.
seeker: Thanks a lot for your suggestions. It really helps.
supporter: You are very welcome! I am glad that I was able to help. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and can surround yourself with positivity!
seeker: Thank you, you too. Merry Christmas.
