seeker: Hi, I feel emotionally sad.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?
seeker: My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face. It is just making me wonder why?
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that. Breakups can be really hard. Did you have a good relationship?
seeker: I really think so. We have been together for 3 years and I really love him. I just don't know why all out of a sudden..
supporter: I think it could be a number of things. Maybe he found someone else, maybe he just didn't feel like it was working anymore, or maybe he was cheating. I would try to focus on some hobbies you enjoy to take your mind off of things.
seeker: You know what, I've also thought about all the possibilities as you mentioned. And I really want to share with some of my friends. But we are not able to go out because of the pandemic, and that gives me a lot of pressure.
supporter: I understand. I have been having a hard time with the pandemic as well. It has made me feel guilty for wanting to stay in. Have you tried to explain to your friends that you do not want to pressure them but you really want to go out and have fun with them? Maybe you can explain that you do not want to put them in danger but you really want to be with them.
seeker: Well, I really don't want to bother them and let them worry about me. And I still haven't fully recovered from the breakup yet. I just, can't focus on anything now.
supporter: I think they would really like to help you, but if you don't want to talk to them, that is okay too. Have you tried to talk to your friends on your own? Maybe you could tell them what you want to say but don't want to talk to them about it.
seeker: I've told some of my friends right after I broke up with my boyfriend. They were very kind. But I think there is something I have to handle by myself. I need to be stronger, but I'm just feeling so upset and not motivated to do anything.
supporter: I think that is a good thing that you have told your friends. Do you feel better about telling them now?.
seeker: Yeah, definitely. They were very helpful. Maybe I should talk to them more frequently?
supporter: I think that is a great idea. I am sure they will all be very supportive.
seeker: Thank you. Maybe I should just forget about my boyfriend and talk more with my friends.
supporter: That sounds like a great idea. That is what I would do.
seeker: Yeah, I will try to do that. Thanks for talking with me.
supporter: You are very welcome. I am glad I could help.
