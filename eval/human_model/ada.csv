"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, how are you doing?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm doing well. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm doing ok. Just I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how you feel. Studying for tests can be very stressful. Have you been studying?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I've been studying hard. But I feel it's so difficult and I can't focus.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have been there myself. Sometimes it is very difficult to study for tests. Have you tried to go to therapy?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: What kind of therapy do you think can be helpful in my situation?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think any kind of therapy would be helpful at this point. I think you need to talk to someone and get some things off your chest.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you mean that is because I'm having too much pressure on myself?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that could be a part of it. I also think that your parents' actions are not okay.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ah, that could be. They are having a lot of expectations on my exams. So, basically I couldn't afford any kinds of failure. That really doesn't feel good.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should try to be as prepared as you can for the exams, and then you won't feel so pressure.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I really want to. But I still think the exams are so difficult. There are a lot of questions I don't know how to answer.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should try to talk to your parents about the way they are making you feel and see if you can come to some sort of arrangement with them.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Emm, you mean I should tell them that I might fail in the exams? Do you think that would work?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes that is what I mean and I think that it would work. They are your parents and I am sure that they care about you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe that's the direction I can go. There is something I really can't do, like the exams. I hope they will understand.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that they will understand.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, thanks anyway for your suggestion. I will talk with them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that you can do it!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! I hope you guys can work things out."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I'm not feeling that good. I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you are feeling about that, that is really not a friend and I understand how you are feeling about that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, she is being so mean recently. I just don't know what happened.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think we all have a friend or family member who has been being mean lately, and it can be hard to understand why. It might be good to talk to her and let her know how you feel about it..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I also think I should do that. Maybe it's because the pandemic. You know, it just makes everyone so frustrated.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that could be it. She probably feels like you don't support her anymore and that's why she's being mean.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ah, that's a really good point. Maybe she wanted to share something with me and that's why she asked me out. Oh, if that's the case, I might have done the wrong thing...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it's probably best to just let her know that you understand how she feels and that you still love her and want her to be happy, but you need some time to yourself to figure out how to work through this too.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, yes. That's definitely correct. I did not notice that. But I think she doesn't want to talk to me now. Maybe I should give her some time?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a good idea. You should give her some time to figure out how she feels about you and your friendship and then you can try to talk again.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That sounds like a really good point. I will try to reach out to her and let her know what I'm thinking.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a great idea. I hope it goes well!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for the suggestion. That really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 months ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I am so sorry to hear that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I felt it was ok in the first a few months. I was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel, I have been looking for a job for almost a year now and I have only had one interview.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, I am sorry to hear that. Seems that we are in the same boat. I have tried some job websites alongside with job centers in the town. But it doesn't really help.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried reaching out to anyone in your family and see if they could help you out with a job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, I haven't tried that. I feel bad letting them know that I could not find a job and I don't want them to worry about me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that and I'm sure they would not want to see you feeling the way you are. I know when I was looking for work I reached out to family and they helped me find a job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe that could be a good solution. Actually I can't even afford my rent next week. So, I'm really worrying about that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know this is a very hard situation to be in, but I know you can make it through it!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, but maybe you're right. I should probably ask my parents for help. Maybe I could just borrow a room from them before I could find a new job.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a great idea and I am sure they would not mind!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks a lot for your suggestion, I feel better now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome! I am glad you feel better!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello. How are you today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, that is very sad. I can understand why you would feel that way.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I need to be alone for 2 weeks and still 10 days to go.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sure that the situation will be resolved in the near future. We are all going through a tough time right now.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it just makes me feel lonely. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried to do any exercise? Exercise can help to relieve some of the stress that you are feeling.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, just a little bit though. I do some exercise everyday when I woke up. But the Covid is just making my body feel so heavy.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. Sometimes the virus is so heavy that it feels like you are never going to get better. It is hard to get any sleep at all..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, exactly. I feel like the body is not under my control. You know, I'm kind of the age with high blood pressure and I'm really worrying about that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that it is really great that you are seeking help for this. Many people are not as fortunate. You can also try to find activities that you enjoy doing that are healthy. For example, you could try to do a 30 minute walk every day. That is a great way to start and you are doing something good for yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, that is a really good suggestion. I also think I should have my body move more frequently. Well, my house is big enough to have a walk, haha.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That is a great idea. You could also try to do a 30 minute walk every day. That is a great way to start and you are doing something good for yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will do that from tomorrow. I really hope I could be better soon to see my kids. I miss them a lot.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that missing your children can be very hard. Do you have any contact with them?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I can't go out. But thanks to the technology, I have a lot video calls with them. That really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That is very helpful. I also find that having time to spend with my children helps me to stay sane during these hard times.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly. Well, then I will need to keep myself healthy to spend more time with them, haha.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I agree. It is important to stay healthy so that you can continue to provide your children with a healthy and happy life.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for your suggestion. And it was nice talking with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are welcome! I hope you are able to find some peace in your situation. I hope you have a nice night!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, you too."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm feeling emotionally sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, what's going on?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah.. My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago without saying goodbye face to face. it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how you feel, that would make you feel betrayed, did he give you a reason for the break up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, not at all. He didn't even give a single word. That's something I'm really upset with.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how you feel, I would be upset to, especially if he was with you for a long time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, we have been together for about 3 years. And I think everything is going well. I just don't know wht happened all out of a sudden.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would say that it probably happened out of the blue, that is usually the case with sudden breakups.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: What do you mean by that? So, you meant he's got some mental issue?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, I mean that he probably has some mental issues that he needs to deal with.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Hmm, I didn't notice that. If that's the case, I feel so guilty because I'm supposed to know that immediately.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that it is probably best to just let him come to his own conclusions about the break up and not try to get him to talk to you about it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you mean I should leave him alone, right now? <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a good idea. You should take some time to yourself and think about what you want to do.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I also think pushing him too much now is not a good idea. Maybe after a while, he will come to me again.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a good plan. It is also good that you are thinking about your feelings.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I know that I love him. Although we don't have a lot of things in common, I do think he is a good person.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that you love him. That is a very strong feeling to have and I am sure that he knows that you love him too. It is also good to know that he is a good person. Do you think that maybe you are feeling sad because you don't have a reason to be happy?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, of course. I feel bad for him if he really suffers from some bad experience. I should have known them much earlier. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that mental illness is a very difficult thing to deal with. It can affect anyone in a significant way. I hope that he will be able to get the help that he needs.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks a lot for your suggestions. It really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome! I am glad that I was able to help. I hope you have a wonderful Christmas and can surround yourself with positivity!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you, you too. Merry Christmas."
