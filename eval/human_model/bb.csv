"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi! How are you? I just got home from a long day at work. I'm exhausted.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for asking. I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. What are you studying? I'm sure you'll do great!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I have a lot of exams going on, like math, physics and some major related subjects like, computer architecture. I just feel that there are so many things that I don't know.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's understandable. I hope you do well on your exams. Do you have any hobbies?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I like playing basketball.<br>     
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's cool. I'm not much of a basketball player, but I do enjoy watching it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's good. But I am not really able to play recently because of the exams.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to take your mind off of it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know. I don't have the confidence to pass the exams and I can't sleep at night.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel. I've been having trouble sleeping lately, too. I think it's because I'm stressed out.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, anyway. I think I don't have other options but to work even harder.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a good way to look at it. Do you have any hobbies that help you relax?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, thanks anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. I hope things get better for you. I'm here if you need someone to talk to.<br>"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi there! How are you? I'm just relaxing after a long day at the office.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, that's good for you. I'm not feeling well though...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any plans for the weekend?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, I don't have plans. I don't feel good because of a friend. I refused to hang out with her because of the Covid. And she felt that I am a selfish person and blocked me from everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry that happened to you. You shouldn't have to put up with that kind of behavior.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I tried to reach out to her to tell her that she was the selfish one. But she blocked me..<br>      
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's unfortunate. Hopefully you can find someone better to spend time with in the future.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know. I don't think she is a person like this. That is really bothering me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry you have to deal with that. I hope you find someone who treats you better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe I should try to talk to some friends. Hopefully that will make me feel better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, I think that would be a good idea. Friends are always good to have.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, recently we are not able to hang out often due to the pandemic. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. Do you have any other friends you can hang out with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe we could have a online party through video calls.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to be a part of something like that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That sounds good. I will let you know later. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I look forward to hearing from you. Have a great evening. Take care of yourself. :)<br>"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi there! How are you? I'm just relaxing after a long day at the office.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm feeling a bit stressful and looking for some assistance though. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of assistance are you looking for? I might be able to help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I lost my job about 4 months ago and I'm not able to find a new one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry. I know how that feels. I've been looking for a new job myself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it was still alright in the first few months, but after looking in different places without success, I started to feel depressed and I feel useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Do you have any hobbies you can do to take your mind off things? I like to draw.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, yeah... I do like travelling.. But I don't feel motivated to do that now. You know, I could not even afford my rent next month.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. Maybe you can get a part time job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I tried some job centers in the town but they don't help much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's too bad. Have you thought about moving to a bigger city? It might be easier to find a job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That will cost a lot of money and I can't afford to do that right now. I think I'm going to move to a cheaper place..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a good idea. I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the talk.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. It was nice talking to you. Have a great day!   P.S. Do you have any pets?<br>"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi there! How are you? I'm just relaxing after a long day at the office.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I'm feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I need to be in quarantine for about two weeks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there anything you can do to ease your mind?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Not really. It jsut started to get worse as the symptoms show up. I started to have fever and caughing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh my goodness! I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take some time off work?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, actually I have been off work about 2 days ago. Just I started to feel lonely all by myself. My wife and kids are now living in my wife's father's house to be away from me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's so sad. I'm sorry you're feeling so lonely. I hope things start looking up for you soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for saying that. But it was good that we could still do video chats. That really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad to hear that. It's always good to have someone to talk to, even if it's just over the phone.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, that's so true. I could still see my kids and hear them sharing something in the school. That is quite fun.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a lot of fun. I wish I could have done that with my parents when I was younger.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. Thanks to the technology and internet. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's for sure. I'm grateful that my parents were able to have me when they did.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. So, what I can do is trying to stay healthy so that I could see them in no time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a good idea. I try to do the same with my kids. I want them to have a long life.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, well, thanks for talking with me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: No problem. It was nice chatting with you. Have a great day!   P.S. I love your username.<br>"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today? I am doing well, thank you for asking. How are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for asking. Actually, I feel emotionally sad recently.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sorry to hear that. I hope you feel better soon. Do you have any hobbies?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend broke up with me about months ago without saying goodbye face to face, that really made me feel bad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I am so sorry that happened to you. I am sure you will find someone better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for saying that. I just want to know why. He could have told me the reason. But there is just no single word from him.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel. I have been broken up with before and it is the worst feeling in the world.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, that's true, especially when you don't know the reason. It just came all out of a sudden.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That is exactly how it was for me. It was out of the blue. I hope you feel better soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I just don't know what to do. I tried to get this out of my mind. But I just can't focus on anything. It really bothers me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know what you mean. It will take some time to get over it but you will get there.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think there might be some methods to help me quickly recover from it. But I don't know how.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you will find something that works for you. Just take it one day at a time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm trying to take it step by step. Maybe as you said, time could fix everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a good idea. I wish you the best of luck. You will get through this.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. If you ever need someone to talk to, don't hesitate to message me.<br>"
