seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hello, how are you doing today?
seeker: Well, I feel so angry about my friend.
supporter: I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
seeker: A friend of mine asked me to hang out, but I refused her because of the Covid. But she thought that I was selfish and didn't want to spend time with a friend. I felt so upset about that.
supporter: I understand how you feel. I also do not like the COVID situation because it's affecting everyone. I think your friend should understand that you are going through a tough time.
seeker: Exactly. But it seems that she thought I was selfish. But I did that for her sake.
supporter: I think you should explain to her that you were not being selfish, and that you were concerned about her well being. I think she will understand.
seeker: Yeah, I really wanted to. But, as you could see, she blocked my messages. So, I'm not able to reach out to her anymore.
supporter: I see. That does make it difficult. Have you tried to talk to her through text?
seeker: Yeah, but there is no reply. I'm not sure if she's read my messages or not.
supporter: I think you should give her some time. Maybe she is having a hard time right now and it is making it difficult for her to communicate.
seeker: Yeah, I think that's the only thing I can do now.
supporter: I would suggest you to keep texting her but make sure you don't overdo it. If she is not responding then it might be best to let her go.
seeker: You're right. I just don't know why she is like that. Could it be the pandemic that affects her?
supporter: I don't think so. I think she is just not interested anymore.
seeker: That sounds hurt. Maybe I became a boring person..
supporter: I don't think you are boring. You just have to find another girl who is interested in you.
seeker: Well, we will see. Thanks for the suggestions anyway. That helps a lot.
supporter: You're welcome. I hope you feel better.
seeker: Thank you.
