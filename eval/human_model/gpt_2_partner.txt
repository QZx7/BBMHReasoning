seeker: I'm feeling emotionally sad.
supporter: I'm really sorry to hear that. What's going on?
seeker: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?
supporter: Oh my gosh, that's horrible. How do you feel about it?
seeker: I feel so bad. You know, we have been together for 3 years and I really love him. I just don't know why all out of a sudden..
supporter: I understand. It's a really strange thing to happen, isn't it? I've been through something similar in the past. It's really hard. Have you tried to talk to him about it?
seeker: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.
supporter: I understand. It's really hard to talk about things like this. I hope that things will get better for you.
seeker: I hope so, too. With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.
supporter: I know how you feel. I also have problems with social anxiety and it's really hard for me to go out and socialize. It makes me feel depressed too.
seeker: Yeah, everything just made me feel so bad, both the breakup and the social problems. I just don't know hat to do now.
supporter: I know, right? It's so hard to go out and socialize. But we have to or we'll never get better.
seeker: So, you think going out can makes me feel better?
supporter: I think it might, just to get out of the house and make some new friends.
seeker: Emm, that sounds like a good idea. Maybe I should try going out and reset my mind.
supporter: I think that would definitely help!
seeker: Ok, that's something I can do. Thanks for the suggestion.
supporter: I think you should try to talk to him and let him know how you feel.
seeker: Well, I will try when I feel better. I just don't want to see him now. Maybe after a while, I can get better.
supporter: I understand that, but I think you should do it now, before it gets too far in the future.
seeker: So, you think that might help to change his mind?
supporter: Yes I think that it might, but it's a really hard situation to be in.
seeker: Ok, I see. I will try then. But as you said, I won't push myself.
supporter: I think that you should try to talk to him and let him know how you feel.
seeker: Ok, thanks for your suggestion.
supporter: No problem. I hope I helped you today.
seeker: You did. Thanks a lot.
