"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am good, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm doing ok. Just I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see, do you have any tutors you can talk to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I talked to the teaching assistant but he jsut said that I should work harder, which was not helpful at all...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you are doing the right things, you should not be afraid to fail, you will never know if you don't try.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I understand that. It's just so stressful for me now. I feel the exams are so difficult. There are a lot of content I don't know. I don't have the confident to pass the exams.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can tell how stressed you are about this, do you study by yourself or with someone?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I have been studying by myself until now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can feel how stressed you are about this, do you study by yourself or with someone?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I have been studying by myself until now. Is it better to study with someone?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it's better to study with someone, I always study with someone and we make sure to study together every day.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, that might be ture. But you know, I don't want anyone to think that I'm stupid. Other guys are so great at studying...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you are putting too much pressure on yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ah.. I'm not sure about it... Maybe you are right? <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think if you join a study group, you will be even more stressed because you will be worried about failing if you don't have a study group.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah.. I probably should take it easy and learn from other guys.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you will be surprised how many people are in the same situation. You will be able to study together and make sure that you don't get lost in the crowd.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is true. I know there are also other guys who feel the exams are difficult, maybe we all should learn from the good guys...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I was in a similar situation last semester. I was struggling with my studying and I felt alone in this. I decided to join a study group and it was the best decision I made. I learned from my friends and it helped me a lot.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's very insightful. Thank you for sharing. I will try that, then.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am glad I could help. I wish you the best of luck. If you ever need anything else, don't be afraid to reach out again.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks a lot."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Good evening . How can I help you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It is about my friend. I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how upsetting it is when people block you. I had a similar situation a few months ago.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, you know. I just didn't want to get us exposed to the Covid. It was all for her sake. But she was just being so mean.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that as well. It's really frustrating when you try to be there for someone and they don't want to be there for you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes. We used to be very good friends. But I don't know why she has changed a lot. Could it be the pandemic?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that could be a reason. I had a similar situation a few months ago with a friend. I ended up having to explain to them that I was still there for them, but they had to make the changes to improve themselves first.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, it looks like a common issue. Well, in my case, I just can't reach out to her right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that it is difficult to open up about what is bothering you. It is important to be able to vent to people, and I'm sure that your friend is willing to listen.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I'm not so sure about that part. But it might take some time before we could talk to each other again.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that too. Sometimes it takes a while for us to open up to people again. It's not a perfect solution, but could you try sending her a message after a while has passed? It might make you feel a bit better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I think that could definitely be helpful. Maybe after a while, she will recover.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope I have been able to help you a little and helped you feel a bit better! You have a great night!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for your suggestion. It was nice talking with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! Feel free to chat anytime you need anything!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello! How are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm not doing so well recently. I lost my job and finding a new one, but it didn't go well.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I can definitely understand why that would be upsetting.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I need to find a job as soon as possible as I probably can't afford the rent for next month.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know the feeling. I'm in the same boat myself. I hope you can find something soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you've also lost your job?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, I have. I was very worried at first, but then I realized that I could use this time to get some experience.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, so what did you do to find a new job?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I went online and looked for jobs. I applied for a lot of them. I got a few interviews and got a job at a call center. I was worried at first, but once I started the job, I didn't worry at all.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It sounds like a quite tough process. I'm not sure. I have tried some job websites and the job centers in the town, but they just don't help.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you talked to anyone in your family and see if they can help you out? They might be able to give you some advice on what to do.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ah, I've thought about that, but I don't want to bother them and I don't want them to feel that I'm a useless person.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure they would not feel that way. I'm sure they would love to help you. It is always good to reach out and talk to people about things that are bothering you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm not sure. But yeah, maybe you're right. I could probably ask them for help.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure they would be more than happy to help. I'm sure you will not lose your job anytime soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I really need somewhere to live now. Maybe I can borrow a room from them before I could find a new job.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you could ask them if you could do that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. That sounds like a good idea for me. Thanks for the suggestion.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad I could help. I hope everything works out for you."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello! How are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I couldn't say very well. I tested positive for Covid this week. And I am doing quarantine at my own house by myself now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds really scary. I'm so sorry to hear that. You're not alone in feeling this way. I'm feeling pretty down myself right now.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, thanks for being so considerate. I'm still doing ok. I've got some light symptoms but that's not a big deal. I'm just feeling a bit lonely to be myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad you're still doing ok. We all feel lonely at this time. It's been a very long year. You're not alone in feeling this way.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I need to do the quarantine for 2 weeks, and still 10 days to go...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know you said you're not interested in online communities, but have you considered using social media to connect with friends and family back home?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't usually use social media. But I do a lot video calls with my wife and kids. They are current at my wife's father's house to be away from me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. I'm also very close to my family and I know how important that is. I was just wondering if that was something you considered.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, indeed. I miss my kids a lot. But thanks to the video chatting tool, we can still have talks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's wonderful! It's really nice to be able to talk to your loved ones even if you are far away.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly. Hopefully I could also stay healthy when I could see them in person.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you will! It's great that you are able to video chat them. That's a really great way to stay connected.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for saying that. Well, I tried move my body a bit everyday, but the Covid just makes my body so heavy.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand that. I'm sure it's not easy for you. But you are doing your best and that is important. I'm sure in a few weeks or months you will be able to go back to normal.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I also think so. Well, I want my kids to see their dad being strong as always, haha.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that you will be a great parent and make sure to always be there for your kids.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks a lot for talking with me. That helps me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are welcome. I hope you have a great day and make sure to keep your head up.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: How are you friend?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm feeling emotionally sad right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. Why are you feeling sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: While, I broke up with my boyfriend 6 months ago. And I still could get myself out of it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, too. It sounds like you're struggling with the emotions that come with a breakup. That can be very difficult and take a while to get over.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. I just feel so difficult to face everything in my life now. It seems that I'm not needed by anyone in the world.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that this might sound personal, but it's completely normal to have these feelings after a breakup. Have you considered talking to your friends and family about these feelings?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I thought about that. But I think that will only make them worry about me. You know, because of the pandemic, I'm at home by myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. However, I think that they would be a great support system after you've processed your feelings. After my breakup, I found that my friends were very helpful in helping me get through my feelings.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I understand that. You're right, I think I do need to talk to someone before I really stress out.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a great idea. I also found that writing out my feelings in a journal helped me a lot..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That looks like a super nice idea. What kind of things do you wirte about?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I wrote down how I felt about the relationship and how it affected my life. I also wrote down things I could do to help myself feel better. I ended up finding a lot of helpful tips on reddit and other places!.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ah, that is really helpful. I probably could also find some useful tips from the internet. There might also be some methods to help me forget about it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, there are so many ways to get help with this. I am so glad I was able to talk to you about this!.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks a lot for the suggestions. That really helps.<br>
