seeker: Hello, there.
supporter: Hello, how are you?
seeker: Well, I'm not feeling that good. I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.
supporter: I understand how you are feeling about that, that is really not a friend and I understand how you are feeling about that.
seeker: Yeah, she is being so mean recently. I just don't know what happened.
supporter: I think we all have a friend or family member who has been being mean lately, and it can be hard to understand why. It might be good to talk to her and let her know how you feel about it..
seeker: I also think I should do that. Maybe it's because the pandemic. You know, it just makes everyone so frustrated.
supporter: I think that could be it. She probably feels like you don't support her anymore and that's why she's being mean.
seeker: Ah, that's a really good point. Maybe she wanted to share something with me and that's why she asked me out. Oh, if that's the case, I might have done the wrong thing...
supporter: I think it's probably best to just let her know that you understand how she feels and that you still love her and want her to be happy, but you need some time to yourself to figure out how to work through this too.
seeker: Yes, yes. That's definitely correct. I did not notice that. But I think she doesn't want to talk to me now. Maybe I should give her some time?
supporter: I think that's a good idea. You should give her some time to figure out how she feels about you and your friendship and then you can try to talk again.
seeker: That sounds like a really good point. I will try to reach out to her and let her know what I'm thinking.
supporter: I think that's a great idea. I hope it goes well!
seeker: Thank you so much for the suggestion. That really helps.
supporter: You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help!
