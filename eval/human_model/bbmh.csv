"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello! How are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm feeling a lot of stress on my study. I'm afraid that I'm going to fail in the exams.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. From what I've seen, studying for tests can be really stressful. Do you have anyone to help you study?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't have anyone to help me with my study. But I did have a talk with the teaching assistant. He told me to work harder, which was not helpful at all.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I've had teachers like that before. They don't seem to realize that different students learn better in different ways.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly, I also feel that way. I just don't know what to do to improve my grades.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you thought about going to a tutor to help you study?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I don't know about that. What is a tutor?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: A tutor is a person who helps you learn the material. They can be a friend, family member, or professional.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if the teachers are willing to do that for me or not...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure that they would not want to do that for you if it is not something that you need. Have you tried talking to your friends or family about how you are feeling about your grades?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, I didn't. I don't want my family to worry about me...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand that, but I think it would be worth talking to them to see how they feel. They might be able to give you some support.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, that might be ture... But It might be good if I could handle this by myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that it can be hard to handle it by yourself, but I think that you can do it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm not sure, but I will try.      <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that you can do it, and I know that you will do well.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the suggestion.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. I'm glad I was able to talk to you tonight."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I feel so angry about my friend.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: A friend of mine asked me to hang out, but I refused her because of the Covid. But she thought that I was selfish and didn't want to spend time with a friend. I felt so upset about that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. I also do not like the COVID situation because it's affecting everyone. I think your friend should understand that you are going through a tough time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly. But it seems that she thought I was selfish. But I did that for her sake.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you should explain to her that you were not being selfish, and that you were concerned about her well being. I think she will understand.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I really wanted to. But, as you could see, she blocked my messages. So, I'm not able to reach out to her anymore.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I see. That does make it difficult. Have you tried to talk to her through text?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, but there is no reply. I'm not sure if she's read my messages or not.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you should give her some time. Maybe she is having a hard time right now and it is making it difficult for her to communicate.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I think that's the only thing I can do now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest you to keep texting her but make sure you don't overdo it. If she is not responding then it might be best to let her go.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You're right. I just don't know why she is like that. Could it be the pandemic that affects her?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I don't think so. I think she is just not interested anymore.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That sounds hurt. Maybe I became a boring person..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I don't think you are boring. You just have to find another girl who is interested in you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, we will see. Thanks for the suggestions anyway. That helps a lot.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. I hope you feel better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you today.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't really feel good. I lost my job recently and I don't know what to do..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, wow I am sorry to hear that. It can be hard to lose a job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, the company is being critical and I was fired.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel, I have lost a job before. It was hard for a while, but I got through it. Have you started looking for a new job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I have tried some job centers for additional information. But that did not help much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried looking for a job outside of your area? I know that I have looked for jobs outside of my area just to get away from my horrible boss.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm not sure, I used to work in a warehouse as a worker. I don't know if I could be able to do some other jobs or not.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that it can be very difficult to find work in these times. What about looking for an online job? I know that there are a lot of online jobs out there that you could do to make a little money while you look for a better job in your area.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, that sounds a way to go? Where can I find the online job?   <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm not sure of all the places that you can find online jobs, but I know that there are a lot of different platforms that you can use to look for jobs. I would recommend starting by searching for them on the internet. You may be able to find a lot of different jobs that way.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, that might help. I'm not so familiar with the internet, but if that could help me find a job.     <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure that you will be able to find plenty of jobs by searching online. Just make sure that you make sure that you are searching for jobs that are appropriate for your skill level.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's ture. I know some of my friends who are also fired found some jobs that they were not suited are suffering from the work. I'd better be careful about that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, you have to be careful about that. You have to make sure that the job description and the company itself are clear about what kind of work you will be doing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Great, thanks a lot for your suggestion. That really helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome. I am glad I could help. Is there anything else I can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's all about it. Thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! Have a good day.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You, too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Thanks! Can you press quit from your end first as alas I can't do it from mine."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello good how are you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: well, I can't say I'm feeling well because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am doing quarantine at my house by myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no I'm sorry to hear that, it must be tough.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it is. And recently, the symptoms started to show up. I've got fever and caughing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, are you showing symptoms?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, light ones though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry, is there anything you can do to help yourself?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know, there are some medicines I could use. So, that might be all about it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yeah, some medicines can help, I suggest you try them out.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah.. Well, the thing I feel bad about is the feeling of lonely. You know, It's difficult to be alone for quite a long time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yeah, but you can't really help that. All you can do is try to stay positive.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's ture. I miss my wife and kids. They are currently staying at my wife's father's house to be away from me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's really rough. It's good that you have your family around to help you out though.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, we couldn't stay together, but we do a lot of video calls, that helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's good. I'm sure that helps a lot.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, indeed. Thanks to the technology.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: It really is a blessing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, exactly.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Do you have any hobbies?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I like travelling. But, I can't really do that now, haha.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I love to travel too. I love to go to new places and see the sights.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe we could share some of the travel thoughts from time to time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a plan.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Great. well, thanks for talking with me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You as well, have a great day.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You, too."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you today.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I feel emotionally sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Can you tell me a little about what is making you feel emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I broke up with my boyfriend about several months ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Breakups are really hard and can make you feel really sad.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I just could not get this out of my mind. It feels so bad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Breakups always feel really bad.  They can even take a long time to process. .<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It takes a long time for me to get adapt to that. And the pandemic is also making everything worse for me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Breakups are hard.  They happen for a reason, and sometimes it just takes time to process all the emotions. .<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I just don't know how to move forward.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think the best thing you can do is to hang out with your friends and talk to them about it.  Get your mind off of it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, that could be a good option if there's no pandemic. I don't want to put my friends in danger because of me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you will be okay.  You seem like a very strong person.  You have taken the right steps to get help.  And I know that you will make the right choices.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, we could have some video calls though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That could be a good way to get some closure on the situation.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, maybe i should try to organize an online party. Hopefully I could forget about the bad things while having fun with my friends.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea.  You can use that stress that has been building up to have some fun instead.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope that could happen, though.            <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Do you need any other help?<br>
