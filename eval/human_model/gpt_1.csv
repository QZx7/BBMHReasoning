"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: hi, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am doing well, thank you. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm doing ok. Just I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have been in that position too. Do you have an academic councelor you can talk to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I don't have a specific councelor to talk to, but I did talk to my professor. But he just said that I should try harder, which was not so helpful...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I was in a similar situation last semester. I was struggling in my classes and had very little motivation to study. My professor helped me a lot with my assignments and I found that going to class and doing the work helped more than I thought it would.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, actually that's also what said by my professor. I just can't concentrate even when I am sitting in the class. I don't feel motivated and I can't sleep at night and have dreams that I will fail in my exams. Is that some illness?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I had a similar experience in my college days. I had a hard time concentrating in class and found that I did better when I went to the classes and did the work myself. I found that my professor didn't help me at all. Have you tried other people in your class?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't if other people are having the exact same feelings or not. Maybe I should talk with them?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I found that the other people in my class had the same problems as me. They were also very upset and upset and upset and the other person had to be in a bad mood because the other person was thinking about something else.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, everyone can have their own things to worry about. What did you do then? How you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I just tried to distract myself with other things. I tried to think that the other person was also struggling.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, you mean I should probably try to do something else before I could re-focus on my study?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a good idea. Do you have any friends in your class you could talk to?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I do have a lot of friends. But we barely hang out together recently due to the Covid. Maybe we should have a party from time to time, just for relax.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea! It's always good to have some fun every now and then.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Ok, that's what I can do. Thanks for the suggestion.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea. I'm glad I could help."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how may i help you today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So, I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during coivd and she questioned our friendship. She thought I was selfish and won't spend time with a special friend. And I feel so upset.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sorry to hear that. Did you do something wrong?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I really don't think so. I just refused to hang out during the pandemic. You know, it could be dangerous. I did that for her own sake.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that you did not want to put her in danger, but I think that you should have talked to her about it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I tried, but as you could see. She just blocked me. And now I can't get contact to her anymore.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that she might need some time to herself, but I think that you should try to reach out to her again.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am not sure about it. It was her fault and she said I was a selfish person. Well, she was the selfish one I would say.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that she might still be able to help you if you give her another chance.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I just can't contact her anymore. But you know, the whole just made me feel so upset and angry. I really want to forget about it but I just can not.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. I would be pretty upset as well.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Right? I feel so tired about this whole thing. I don't know how can I get this out of my mind.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know, it's been a really crazy year. I can't believe how many things have happened.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it seems that people have changed a lot because of the pandemic. It's frustrating.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know, it's really been frustrating. But I know you can get through this!.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know, i will try to. I should probably think of a way to relax myself a little bit.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a great idea! Maybe take your mind off of things by talking to someone you trust.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That sounds like a good idea. I should probably have video calls with some friends.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea! Video calls are so helpful.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, they do. It's really helpful when you can't meet face to face, but still want to keep in touch with each other. <br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad it did!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks! It was nice talking to you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! I'm glad I could help!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 months ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. I can understand how you feel.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, well, first a few months was kind of alright. I was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that as well. I was looking for work for almost a year.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me. It is really tough, and I really don't know what to do.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried reaching out to a career counselor or recruiter?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was trying some job websites alongside with job centers in the town. But they didn't help me much. Do you think a career counselor could help me find a job?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that a career counselor could definitely help you find a job. Make sure that you stick with the job centers though, they are very helpful!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But will that be taking a long time until I find a job. I am really running out of money and I could not even pay the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should keep looking, especially since you have so much experience. There are a lot of resources online that you could use to look for jobs.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, that sounds like a long time before I could find a job. I might have to move out.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that. Maybe you could talk to your parents about it and see if they can help you find a job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, you know, I don't want to bother them for my personal issue. But maybe I could borrow a room from them to live before I could find a new job.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that, but they are your parents and they want you to be happy.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I understand what you mean here. But I think that's more like my style. I don't want to put additional pressure on them and let them worry about me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that, but they are your parents and they want you to be happy.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, maybe I could use some help from them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that, but they are your parents and they want you to be happy.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: well, thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am glad you felt a little less stressed. Do you want to talk about anything else?"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am doing well. How are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no, that is so sad! I can understand why you would feel that way. Do you have any friends or family that you can talk to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I do have someone comforting me. But It just feels so lonely by myself. And I started to show some symptoms. I started to have fever and coughing. It just feels so bad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's great that you have someone to talk to. I'm sure it's a lot easier to deal with this stuff when you have someone to talk to about it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, my wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I really miss them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's really sweet of her. I'm sure it's hard to be away from your kids.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, It was good that we could do a lot of video chats. That helps a lot.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a great idea. It's good to have someone to talk to about it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. But the Covid is really frustrating. I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine. Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand, the pandemic has really been a challenge. Have you talked to your doctor about it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, the doctor also kind of keeps negative about the ongoing situation about the pandemic. Hope there would be a solution for this as soon as possible.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, I hope you get the help you need.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I could only stay positive.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's very true, and I feel the same about you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, well I probably have to be like that, though the Covid won this week.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. I'm glad that you're doing okay though.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for talking with me. It helps when I still have to stay by myself for 10 days.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad it does."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, I feel emotionally sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend broke up with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face. It is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. Breakups can be really hard. Did you have a good relationship?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I really think so. We have been together for 3 years and I really love him. I just don't know why all out of a sudden..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it could be a number of things. Maybe he found someone else, maybe he just didn't feel like it was working anymore, or maybe he was cheating. I would try to focus on some hobbies you enjoy to take your mind off of things.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You know what, I've also thought about all the possibilities as you mentioned. And I really want to share with some of my friends. But we are not able to go out because of the pandemic, and that gives me a lot of pressure.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. I have been having a hard time with the pandemic as well. It has made me feel guilty for wanting to stay in. Have you tried to explain to your friends that you do not want to pressure them but you really want to go out and have fun with them? Maybe you can explain that you do not want to put them in danger but you really want to be with them.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I really don't want to bother them and let them worry about me. And I still haven't fully recovered from the breakup yet. I just, can't focus on anything now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think they would really like to help you, but if you don't want to talk to them, that is okay too. Have you tried to talk to your friends on your own? Maybe you could tell them what you want to say but don't want to talk to them about it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've told some of my friends right after I broke up with my boyfriend. They were very kind. But I think there is something I have to handle by myself. I need to be stronger, but I'm just feeling so upset and not motivated to do anything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a good thing that you have told your friends. Do you feel better about telling them now?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, definitely. They were very helpful. Maybe I should talk to them more frequently?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a great idea. I am sure they will all be very supportive.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you. Maybe I should just forget about my boyfriend and talk more with my friends.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea. That is what I would do.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I will try to do that. Thanks for talking with me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome. I am glad I could help."
