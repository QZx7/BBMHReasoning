<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Hi, how are you doing today?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Hi, I am doing ok, how are you?
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Good thank you. Why only ok? What is bothering you?.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Well 2020 is bothering me, like everyone else.. earlier this year my job was terminated, then for 3 months I was not bringing in income. Now that COVID is still out there, I fear that my current job will be terminated.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I'm sorry to hear that. 2020 has been tough for many, so you are not alone.. I have been through a similar situation in the beginning of the year where I have lost my job. I was fearful but I kept thinking positive thoughts and it helped me get through tough times..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> True, I have been trying to think of other things I can do, like start a business. But I have been working for 20 years, that I feel like I am supposed to work for someone else and not for myself.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> That is a great idea. The government has great support programs for new business owners like you.. I think working for yourself is great. You can set your own hours, chart your own path. It would help with your employment situation for sure..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I feel that I have not ideas.  I feel like i have been thinking about a business idea for myself and family for some time now.  I wonder how others decide on what to do. Like how to get that motivation in their head to start something really new.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> My suggestion would be to think what your local neighborhood needs - maybe it is lacking a cafe or a grocery store? .
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I know, i really want a niche company.. Something that no one has thought of, or is not yet in my community..
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Yes, I can identify with that. Motivation is hard - but think about your future job situation and your family..

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Hello! How can I encourage you today? Hello! How can I encourage you today? Sorry that posted twice! :o.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Hey so my best friend finally stopped showing up. We're growing apart...
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> You are growing apart from your best friend? Is this a good thing or not a good thing? Or you aren't sure?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> It's an expected thing but it's sad. We have hurt each other many times and he is a daily drug user and is very much a fair weather friend.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Ouch! That is a sad thing. As I was sitting here thinking about friends I have moved on from, sadly, most of the time it was for the best, even though it hurt at the time.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> My friend stopped showing up when he said he would and I slowly stopped answering his calls and texts.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Life is a journey, and as we walk toward goals in our life, people either join us or bring us down.  Sometimes they only walk on the path we are on for a short time, sometimes longer. I have very few friends from High School, 2 to be exact. And only on FB, that was back in 1979 too. lol I'm old, but I have had to move on from destructive relationships, as you are doing now. It can be hard.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> This is so strange and wonderful connecting with a stranger about this! Wow. That's true. I kept trying to get my friends clean and to work on a hobby with me but drugs destroyed my two best friends and killed one of them.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Ouch! That sounds hard. I had friends like that too. I had to walk away. Has your friend asked you why you are ignoring him? The reason I ask this is because it's good to get some closure and let them know their behavior is destructive and you need space from that.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> No, he seemed to respond with pride. He deleted his facebook and never talked to me again after that.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I have learned in life that unhealthy people run from problems, healthy people stick in the mud with you and try to work out issues.. Have you other friends?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> True. It's hard to connect with people after high school. The mindset of high school is make friends and the mindset of adulthood is survival. No, not now. I am married though.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Yes, and as you grow and mature, your life goals change, not everyone will travel with you. Right now you are starting out, I'm in the retired stage, lol Now I'm interested in helping younger people. It's amazing how our priorities change..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yeah some people just don't want to do anything in their lives...
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I've basically figured out life only makes sense with God, and I don't worry about a thing now, very little upsets or angers me, it truly isn't worth it.  A LOT of people have no goals. I think this is actually a good time to examine the year, what you did right, what you didn't do so right, and where you want to go next year.  I think self reflection is good for us..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> This year has been a great test for us all and a call to faith.

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Have you talked to the professor in the class you are struggling in about ways he can help you learn better? I have found that speaking with my professors when I was struggling and explaining why has helped me in the past.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yes, I have talked with him. Unfortunately, communication is the worst part with him. He will read emails but only selectively respond to some things. I ask him to give me the details for an assignment he never sent the details for and he always ignores it. I don't think he even has the assignment instructions recorded anywhere.

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I am feeling a bit the same. Is there something specific that you'd like to talk about?.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Well, I moved to a new state - feeling pretty alone.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Do you not know anyone else there?.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> No, not really. I inherited some money, because both of my parents died last year. So I bought a house I love, in a tiny town...
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Do you think it would benefit you to join some groups or societies where you would meet new people?. If you feel a little out of your depth, that is perfectly normal at this stage!.

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> HI, how are you today?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I am not doing well. I am very worried about my son's chances of recovery after so many relapses and frustrated because I know there is really nothing I can do to change things for him.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> You must be very frustrated from feeling unable to do something.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I am. He is a different person when he's not on drugs but when he is using he can get really mean and he scares me.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I remember when my mother was having end of life mental declining issues. I understand feeling as if the person is changing and having unusual moods and mood swings. . Do you have anyone you can talk to?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I try not to think about the situation, because I don't see him since he lives in another state. But I can't get everything out of my mind. And yes I have my husband to talk to, that helps some. It's when I'm trying to sleep or when my husband isn't home that's the worst for me.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> You are feeling the way anybody in your situation would fee like. It must be helpful to have a husband who listens and can be supportive when he is there. Have you always had sleep issues?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> It does help but he's as frustrated and upset as I am. I can't sleep at night for dwelling on everything and I don't know how to stop the thoughts about all the terrible things that could happen. When I'm upset about something I cannot sleep but if I'm in a good state of mind I sleep well.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Being upset can make someones mind race and make it really difficult to rest or get any sleep at all. Have you ever gone through anything like this before?

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I can relate to being close to someone who is addicted. It can feel very sad and lonely at times. I would want to change the person in my life but just has to learn to let go instead. It is a process that takes years to learn.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I am realizing that more every day. If it wasn't my son and just a good friend I would probably end the relationship but a mother can't do that to her own children, you know what I mean? And you are so right. I can't change or control him, I can only change and control myself and my responses to him. That is so difficult to do.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Yes, I understand how it can feel like our children are always our babies and we want to fix everything for them. Sometimes it feels like we can change them or re raise them if we just do more for them. Have you had the chance to speak to a close friend or pastor about this situation?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Not really. Most of my friends haven't dealt with that so they don't really understand what I am going through, or even what my son is going through. But you're right, I have to learn to let go and let him fix his own problems with no intereference from me.

So someone reported me for some bs thing on playstation cuz they think I must be trash if I don't love my mom or something.

Maybe I am dislikeable for my coworkers but pretty for someone else. Do you think my boss will react positively to your suggestion?
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Okay, well maybe that may be a good place to start with your boss? I think it will be a great place to start. Sometimes it helps to reach out and hear other's perspective of you.. What do you think about that suggestion? Are you hesitant about it?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I feel like maybe I can give it a try.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> And I think everyone is beautiful. You are definitely right about beauty being relative. I personally choose to see the beauty in everything and it has made life a lot more beautiful for me..

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Well you know, I have found sometimes that we need time to ourselves in order to fully understand how we need to grow.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I do software development, but its a work at home situation.  So i have been just by myself for the last week, and its driving me crazy.  All i do is think about why she would do that. I've had time to myself but its not getting any better.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I have always tried to think of things in a positive way. This way even when something really bad happens, it doesn't seem so bad as to overwhelm us from recovering.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> What positive are there here?
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I'm actually trying to get into the Software Development field, how do you like it? Well, there is plenty of opportunity out there. Not too mention, being in that profession, you probably aren't hurting for money.

<br><strong>seeker:</strong> what, you want to break stuff to relieve stress.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I completely understand. My wife used to think I was just playing on the computer all day, lol. I run. Every morning, I jog about 2 miles. It is awesome to get the blood going and a great way to start the day.

<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Hi there, could you please give me some advice?
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Hello, would you like to explain your situation and we can go through  it together.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I feel that I am blowing my future because I am just not scoring well on tests these days. I just don't feel motivated to work as hard as I know that I should.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> So you don't feel motivated and you are not scoring well, have I understood that correctly?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yes. I know that the two things are probably related but I just do not know what to do about them.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> What are you currently studying?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I am studying microbiology. I do not know that I have the passion for it that I once did though..
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Your motivation and how you are studying is probably related, you are right. What attracted you to microbiology in the first place?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I have always found it fascinating and have an uncle who is a microbiologist. But these days I feel I made the wrong decision. Is it too late to change?.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> It is never too late to change anything. However, i hear that you have always found it fascinating,have you considered talking to your uncle and seeing if you can find what you loved about it again?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yes that does sound like good advice. I do not want to turn by back on my studies of the past years. But my grades are really poor and I am not sure what to do about that..
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Studying can be really difficult , especially when you are half way through. i struggled in my studies and found that talking to my tutors helped and approaching student support. Have you tried anything like that or has your motivation held you back?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> To be honest I have been a little afraid to approach them about the subject because they might accuse me of just slacking. I know it might look like that from the outside..
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Just from chatting to you, I can sense that you are anxious, however, as many students feel this way, they will have a whole lot of help they can provide.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I do feel that part of my problem is that I am afraid to really open up about it. You are the first person I have really felt able to talk to..
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I am pleased that you have been able to open up to me, it is the first step towards you finding your path. Do you find it easy to write things down?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yes, it is really much more easy to write my problems down than to actually talk to people about them face to face..

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> How are you doing?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Hi im good. How r u.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I'm well.  How can I help you?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> I'm a bit confused what I should do. I've been laying low for now. I think I guy I dated might still be interested. But there is another one who is interested now. But he hasn't stepped up yet. Not sure if I should forget about both of them and stay single.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> It sounds like you are struggling with deciding on your relationship with partners.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> yeah. not sure if either one is worth it or not.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> It's good you are asking yourself questions.  What do you want out of the relationships?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Something normal! Im fine with being single too. It comes with a lot less drama.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> It sounds like the relationships give you a lot of drama.  What do you crave in a relationship?
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> companionship and nonconditional support. committment and that is hard to find out here these days. a lot of guys want the physical without the commitment. I'm getting too old for those games.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I understand where you are coming from.  I've seen a lot of men in relationships not be so committed for real, but just like the physical part.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> yep. like my aunt said why pay for the milk when you can get the cow for free. i've done that for years and im getting tired of it. not to mention my libido is slowing down so i see things clearer.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Just from chatting with you, I see that you feel like you want more from the relationship and would like commitment on more than one level.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> yes when it comes down to it. and i don't know if i will ever find it- especially these days. and i don't want to settle.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I had to look for someone who was committed in all areas and only figured this out after making mistakes.  I can see you have really shown maturity in learning from your experiences.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> it's easy to settle when you're attracted to the guy. I have learned a lot from my past. I'm afraid the two might find out about each other. Not sure if it's a good thing or not.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> From what I've seen having confidence in yourself and what you feel in your heart won't lie.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> do you think it's good if they find out about each other? sometimes guys try harder when they know there is competition. sometimes it makes them run the other way.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Do you think one may have jealousy and get aggressive if he finds out?  It's a personal decision that takes some thought..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> honestly im not sure. there is always that risk when doing that with guys. i better think long and hard before doing that!

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> I have experienced something similar. I found myself getting short tempered and taking things out on my loved ones..
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> Yes exactly. I need help balancing it all out. And saying no at work while still progressing in my career.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Have you considered any kind of counselling to talk through these feelings? There are some organisations around that will offer help for free. Perhaps honestly talking things through with your partner would really help you both too..

<br><strong>supporter:</strong> Have you tried to reach out to any of the free student services such as councillors.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> No, althought I prefer those than help lines.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> your situation is unique to you and they would be there to help. That what you pay tuition for.
<br><strong>seeker:</strong> What if they make fun of me.
<br><strong>supporter:</strong> That would get them fired.  but it's ok if you don't want to go to them. I would suggest talking to your friend first at least. Even if you don't trust him. You need to express your emotions to someone.
