hi there.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: Hello! How are you doing today?
Thanks for asking, I'm doing ok. 
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I'm glad to hear you're doing okay. Is there anything that's bothering you?
Yeah, I could say it's bothering me. You know, my best friend seems to hate me now. The other day they had a party with some other guys but none of them notified me. I feel being isolated by them.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I can understand how that would feel unfair. Do you think you could talk to them about it and see why they feel the way they do?
I could, but it seems that they won't reply my messages in the group. You know, I feel that they have decided to be like this together. 
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I can understand how frustrated that would make you. I would feel the same way.
Yeah, I really don't know what I've done wrong. It's just all out of a sudden.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I can imagine that it is. It's like a slap in the face when you feel you are being treated well and then all of a sudden you aren't.
Yeah, exactly. I don't know what happens. I mean if they told me the reason, I could fix it. But they just started to ignore me.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I have had that happen to me before. It really hurts and then you start to wonder what else is wrong and then it's hard to come to a conclusion.
Yeah, it's such a bad experience. How did you overcome that? 
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I just had to let it go and move on. I tried to focus on other aspects of my life and how I wanted it to be.
So, you mean, there is basically nothing more we can do by ourselves.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I mean try to focus on other things in your life. If they really wanted to stay in your life they would make some effort to stay in contact.
That makes sense. There is really nothing more we can do. I hope they could let me the reason in the future. And if they just keep doing this, I don't think I can be friends with them.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: I have learned in life that if someone wants to stay in your life they will make an effort to do so. If they don't they weren't really that good of a friend to begin with.
Ok, I think I know what to do, thanks for the help.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: You are very welcome. I hope you feel a little better about things.
Thank you.
Enter Your Message: [TransformerGenerator]: Things will get better for you too.

Enter Your Message: Hello, how are you?
[TransformerGenerator]: Hello good how are you.
Enter Your Message: I'm sad and angry because I no longer talk to my best friend.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry to hear that, why are you not talking to your best friend?
Enter Your Message: Well, she was staying at my house for a month and we were constantly fighting so she just stopped talking to me.
[TransformerGenerator]: I understand why you would be upset about that, I would be too.
Enter Your Message: Yes, and she began avoiding me while we were in the same house, so we started arguing again and I found she's been lying to me since I've known her and I'm very upset.
[TransformerGenerator]: I've been in a similar situation, I was in a long distance relationship with my best friend and we were fighting a lot so she stopped talking to me. But, we started talking again and we are still best friends to this day.
Enter Your Message: How did that happen? Did one of you apologize? 
[TransformerGenerator]: We just decided to give each other some space and then we started talking again and it was like we never stopped talking. I don't think an apology would really help you out here. I think you should just let it go. You're both adults, she will come around eventually.
Enter Your Message: You know, from the beginning I respected her a lot. But you know, it just, makes me feel angry that I was being used for so long and constantly lied to.
[TransformerGenerator]: I understand how you feel, but I think you should just focus on yourself and not worry about what happens with her.
Enter Your Message: Maybe you're right, probably I should talk to my other friends the situation some more so I can get over it without thinking about too much.
[TransformerGenerator]: I think that would be a good idea, and it sounds like she would also want you to do that too.
Enter Your Message: Now I start to realize that I wasn't angry with my friend but rather myself.
[TransformerGenerator]: I know how you feel, but I think you should just focus on yourself for now.
Enter Your Message: Because I basically allowed her to use me for seven years and kept lying to me or gave her space because I thought I was being a good friend. I feel like I was stupid to do that and soft.
[TransformerGenerator]: I understand how you feel, but it's over now and it's not going to happen again. There's no need to dwell on the past.
Enter Your Message: Yeah, that's right. I just need to pay more attention in the future. Thank you very much for your advice.
[TransformerGenerator]: You're welcome. I hope you feel better.
Enter Your Message: Thanks, enjoy the rest of your day.
[TransformerGenerator]: You too!
