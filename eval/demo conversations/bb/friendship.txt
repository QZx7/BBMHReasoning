[TransformerGenerator]: Hello, how are you doing today? I am just relaxing after a long day at work.
Enter Your Message: Oh, that's good for you. Thanks for asking. I'm feeling bad.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry to hear that. Why are you feeling bad? I hope you feel better soon.
Enter Your Message: Yeah, I could say it's bothering me. You know, my best friend seems to hate me now. The other day they had a party with some other guys but none of them notified me. I feel being isolated by them.
[TransformerGenerator]: That is terrible. I am sorry you have to deal with that. Have you tried talking to them about it?
Enter Your Message: I could, but it seems that they won't reply my messages in the group. You know, I feel that they have decided to be like this together. 
[TransformerGenerator]: That is unfortunate. Maybe you should try to find a new group to hang out with.
Enter Your Message: Yeah, I really don't know what I've done wrong. It's just all out of a sudden.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you can find a way to get back in touch with them.
Enter Your Message: Do you have any suggestions?
[TransformerGenerator]: Well, you could try messaging them on social media. That might be a good way to reach them.
Enter Your Message: That sounds good. Thanks.
[TransformerGenerator]: You're welcome. I wish you the best of luck with this. I'm sure it will work out in the end.
