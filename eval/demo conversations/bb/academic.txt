Enter Your Message: hi there.
[TransformerGenerator]: Hello! How are you? I just got home from work. I work at a grocery store.
Enter Your Message: oh, it's good for you. I've been feeling a lot of pressure and stress lately due to school.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry to hear that. What are you going to school for? I'm studying to be a nurse.
Enter Your Message: Well, I am in a doctoral program, so I have to work on my thesis on the side even with all of my classes and I had a hard time managing my time and keeping track.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sure you'll do great! Do you have any hobbies? I like to read.
Enter Your Message: Thanks, I also like reading. 
[TransformerGenerator]: That's great! What kind of books do you like? I really like romance novels.

[TransformerGenerator]: I am sure you will do just fine. Do you have any hobbies to help you relax?
Enter Your Message: I like playing basketball though.
[TransformerGenerator]: Basketball is a lot of fun. I like to go to the gym and lift weights.
Enter Your Message: Well, yeah. I don't know what to do with my tests, I feel so nervous about it.
[TransformerGenerator]: I know how you feel. I always feel like I am going to mess up on my tests.
Enter Your Message: Yeah, how do you solve that?
[TransformerGenerator]: You just have to take a deep breath and tell yourself that you are going to ace it.
Enter Your Message: alright, thanks anyway.
[TransformerGenerator]: You are welcome. I hope you do well on your tests. I know you can do it.
