Enter Your Message: Hello.
[TransformerGenerator]: Hi there! How are you? I'm just relaxing after a long day at the office.
Enter Your Message: I don't feel good. I broke up with my boyfriend. He cheated on me.
[TransformerGenerator]: Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to move on and find someone better.
Enter Your Message: I thought that I met a handsome intelligent man. We dated for a month. Then out of nowhere he cheated on me. I'm so sad. I am just trying to understand what I did wrong.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry that happened to you. It sounds like he wasn't the right person for you.
Enter Your Message: I don't know. Maybe that's something we have to learn from experience.
[TransformerGenerator]: That's a good way to look at it. I wish you the best of luck in the future.
Enter Your Message: I don't know what to do, can get him out of my mind.
[TransformerGenerator]: I think that's the best thing you can do. Try to get your mind off of him.
Enter Your Message: Maybe I should focus on myself.
[TransformerGenerator]: That sounds like a good idea. Do you have any hobbies you could do to help you out?
Enter Your Message: Yes, I like watching movies. Maybe I could just watch another movie.
[TransformerGenerator]: What kind of movies do you like to watch? Maybe you could find some new ones to watch.
Enter Your Message: well, I think it's better for me to do it by myself. You know, just to calm down.
[TransformerGenerator]: That's a good way to go about it. I hope things start looking up for you soon.
Enter Your Message: Thanks for the suggestion.
[TransformerGenerator]: You're welcome. If you ever need someone to talk to, feel free to send me a message.

Enter Your Message: hi, there.
[TransformerGenerator]: Hello! How are you doing today? I'm just relaxing at home with my cat and dog.
Enter Your Message: I've just really been experiencing a very tough time lately.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for you. What is going on?
Enter Your Message: Well, it started with a break up. My boyfriend and I dated for 7 years and suddenly out of nowhere, he dumps me over text. I keep blaming myself and my body for this.
[TransformerGenerator]: I'm so sorry that happened to you. I can't imagine what you must be going through.
Enter Your Message: Yeah, I just don't know what to do, I can't get myself out of that.
[TransformerGenerator]: I am so sorry you are going through this. I wish I could give you a hug.
Enter Your Message: Thanks for the words. You know, he is a very good person. I think we do develop good relationship for a long time. We've been supporting each other until now. But it seems that 7 years, he has changed and everything just doesn't feel right. I know sometimes I could be selfish, but I really love him.
[TransformerGenerator]: I know what you mean. I have been in a similar situation. It is hard to let go.
Enter Your Message: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How did you overcome that?
[TransformerGenerator]: I just had to let it go. It was hard at first, but it got better with time.
Enter Your Message: Maybe that's true. Shall I just let it go?
[TransformerGenerator]: Yes, I think you should. It will be better for both of you in the long run.
Enter Your Message: But I think we still have feelings on each other. You know, I still love him.
[TransformerGenerator]: That is good to hear. I am sure you will be able to work things out in the end.
Enter Your Message: Well, maybe I should have a talk with him.
[TransformerGenerator]: I think that would be a good idea. I wish you the best of luck in the future.
Enter Your Message: Thanks.
[TransformerGenerator]: You are welcome. I hope you have a great rest of your evening. Take care.
