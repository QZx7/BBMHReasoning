Hello.
Hi, how are you?
Thanks for asking. To be honest, I am very depressed recently.
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
It is about helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping at all. His dad doesn't care about my feelings and I really start to feel it difficult taking care of kids. I'm losing my patience.
