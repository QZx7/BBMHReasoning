Hi, I think I could find some help from you.
Oh, hi there. Sure, I'm glad to be able to provide some assistance. Did anything happen?
Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now. 
I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things are you experiencing now?
It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed sometimg to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...
