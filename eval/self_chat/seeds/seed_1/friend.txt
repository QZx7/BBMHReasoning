Hi, how are you doing?
Oh, hi. I'm doing good. How about you?
Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit upset about my friend.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Did anything happen?
Yeah, we used to hang out together quite often, but he's got a new girlfriend recently. His girlfriend is very unpleasant to everyone and doesn't allow him to spend a lot of time with us. That's bothering me.
