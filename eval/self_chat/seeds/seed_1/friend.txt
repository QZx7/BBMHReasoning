Hi.
Oh, hi. How are you doing?
I'm doing ok, just a bit sad.
I feel bad to hear that, could you please share more details?
Yeah, it's about my friend. She wanted to hang out with me and I refused her because of the pandemic. And she felt that I was selfish and didn't want to spend time with her. It's really bothering me.
