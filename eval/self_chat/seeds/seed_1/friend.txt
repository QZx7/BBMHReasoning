Hi.
Oh, hi. How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm feeling a bit upset about my friends.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more details about that?
Yeah... Several friends of mine had a trip together without letting me know. They created a secret group discussing the details without me. And when I ask them about that, they just said that they forgot to let me know .. That's really bothering me.
