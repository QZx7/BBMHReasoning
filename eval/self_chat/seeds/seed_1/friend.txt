Hi, how are you doing?
Oh, hi. I'm doing good. How about you?
Yeah, I'm doing ok.
Is there anything I could help you with? Any troubles?
Yeah, it's something about my best friend. We used to hang out together quite often, but he's got a new girlfriend recently. His girlfriend is very unpleasant to everyone and doesn't allow him to spend a lot of time with us. That's bothering me.
