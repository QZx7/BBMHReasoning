Hi, how are you doing?
Oh, hi. I'm doing good. How about you?
Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit upset about my friend.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more details about that?
Yeah, a long time friend borrowed some money from me weeks ago for the medical fee for his son. And I now really need that money back for some emergency usage. But I know that money is very improtant for him, now. I really don't know how should I tell him.
