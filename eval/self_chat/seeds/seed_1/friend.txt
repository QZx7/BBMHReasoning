Hi.
Oh, hi. How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm worrying about my friend.
I'm so sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more details about that?
Yeah.. We haven't met each other for several years. And we just moved to the same city recently. Last week when we met, I acknowledged that he's now into some drugs. His status was so bad and I really want to help him but I don't how.
