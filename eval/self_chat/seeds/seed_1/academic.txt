Hi, how are you?
Doing good. How are you?
Oh, I'm feeling really anxious recently. 
May I ask why do you have that feeling?
Yeah.. I start to find the online course to be so difficult for me. You know, our school started online courses because of the Covid. But I just think I can't focus on the study learning online.
