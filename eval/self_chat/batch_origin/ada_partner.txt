seeker: Hello.
supporter: Oh, hi, how are you doing?
seeker: I feel emotionally sad.
supporter: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope I could help you. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?
seeker: My boyfriend broke up with me about several months ago. And he didn't even say goodbye face to face. I just don't know why..
supporter: Oh, I'm so sorry! That is really hard when you feel betrayed like that. I think that you might be better off without him..
seeker: I think so too..
supporter: I've been in a similar situation and I know how hard it is..
seeker: I don't know what to do with myself..
supporter: Have you tried to talk to your partner about how you feel? It helps to clear the air and make sure that everyone understands everyone elses perspective..
seeker: I have and he says he feels the same way. But I don't know what I did to make him do this..
supporter: I think that you did nothing wrong. Sometimes people just feel different at a certain time and it can be hard for the other person to understand. I would suggest giving him some time to think about what he wants and how you feel.
seeker: I think you're right. But I'm just not sure how long. We're not together anymore and I don't know how long to wait before I try to find someone else..
supporter: I would give it at least a year before you try to find someone new.
seeker: Okay, I think that's a good idea. But it's hard not to get anxious and worried about what will happen next.
supporter: I understand it is hard to wait, but you should try to focus on things that you can control..
seeker: I think that's also a good idea. But what if I don't find anything in the meantime? I don't want to be stuck in a relationship just because I'm waiting for something.
supporter: I think you should try to spend more time with your friends and family. They will help you to get over your ex.
seeker: That's also a good idea. But what if my friends and family make fun of me for being in a relationship now?.
supporter: I think that they would not do that if you told them what is going on.
seeker: That's also true. But what if they start to make fun of me for being in a relationship with an ex?.
supporter: I think that they are not worth your time if they are going to make fun of you for things that happened in the past.
seeker: That's also true. But what if my ex starts to make fun of me for things that happened in the past.
supporter: I think that you should not let that happen. You should stand up for yourself and if they do not respect that, then maybe it is time to move on.
seeker: That's also true. But what if my ex starts to make fun of me for things that happened in the past.
supporter: I think that you should not let that happen either. You should stand up for yourself and if they do not respect that, then maybe it is time to move on.
