seeker: Hi, there.
supporter: Hello, how are you?
seeker: Yeah, I'm not doing very good. I lost my job about 4 months ago and I'm looking for some assistance.
supporter: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?
seeker: I've been trying to find a new job, but it's been really hard.
supporter: I understand, it's especially hard when you've been working there for a long time.
seeker: Yeah, it's really hard when you're not sure what's next.
supporter: Have you tried reaching out to any job agencies to help you find a new job?
seeker: I have, but I'm not sure which ones to contact.
supporter: I'm sure there are several, but perhaps searching online would help.  I'm sure you've done a great job of looking for your own job, so doing that again might help you find a new job.
seeker: I'll try that, but I'm not sure how it'll help. But I'll try.
supporter: Perhaps looking at different jobs in your field might help.  You might be able to find something that you'd never even considered before.
seeker: That's true. I'll try that.
supporter: I hope that you're able to feel better soon.  I know how bad it feels to be depressed.
seeker: Thank you. I appreciate your help.
supporter: You're welcome.  I hope you have a good rest of your day.
seeker: Thank you, you too.
