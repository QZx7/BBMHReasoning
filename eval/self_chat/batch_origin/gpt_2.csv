"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello! How are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... I'm feeling a lot of stress on my study recently. I'm afraid that I'm gonna fail in the exams.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear you are feeling stressful. Do you have anyone you can talk to about your study stress?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I do, but I'm afraid that they'll think I'm being too dramatic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure they won't think you are being too dramatic. Students are very important to the economy and they deserve to be well-rested and healthy so they can do their best in their studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess you're right. But... I haven't been doing very well in my exams lately. I'm afraid that the rest of my class will judge me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you are worried about your grade, which is completely understandable, but remember that you have to do your best for you and not worry about what other people think.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess you're right. But, this is a pretty important grade for me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you will do your best and pass those exams with flying colors.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... It's something about one of my long time friends. Well, she asked me to hang out and I refused her because of the pandemic. So, she now thinks I'm a selfish person and blocked me away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh! I understand how you are feeling. It is okay to feel selfish during this pandemic.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... I mean, I get that people are frustrated. But that doesn't mean they get to make decisions for me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. It is frustrating when people do not take your feelings into consideration.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... I mean, I get that people are frustrated. But that doesn't mean they get to make decisions for me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. Have you tried asking your friends to make decisions for you in a more considerate way?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have, but they seem to be unable to do so.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how frustrating that can be, especially when it comes to important decisions like jobs.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah. My friends are all very successful, but they seem to have no problem making decisions for me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have found that some people don't realize they are not being helpful, and they actually think they are doing you a favor.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That could be true, but I still feel like they should know better. Do you have any suggestions on how I can tell them better?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have found that people who are in that position don't want to be, and really do want to do the right thing.  They just don't have the knowledge or experience to do so.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That makes sense. But what if they actually do think they are doing me a favor?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that too, but I think it's more likely that they don't realize they are doing a bad thing, than that they are doing it on purpose.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That could be true, too. I guess I just don't know what to do about them. I don't want to have to avoid them or anything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that.  It's a tough situation to be in.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'll just have to try to talk to them about it. Do you think I should just have a serious conversation with them?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that's a great idea.  It's important that you feel safe in your workplace.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I do feel safe at my workplace. It's just really frustrating when these people are trying to get under my skin.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand.  Can you tell me a little about the people that are trying to get under your skin?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: They are mostly older men. One of them is really aggressive and tries to start a fight most of the time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that.  That must make you feel uncomfortable.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It does. I want to just get away from them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand.  Can you tell me a little about the people that are trying to get under your skin?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: They are mostly older men. One of them is really aggressive and tries to start a fight most of the time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how frustrating that must feel.  Is there anyone you can report this to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I could probably go to the police.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would definitely go to the police.  I'm sure they would be very interested to hear about this.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would definitely go to the police.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would also report him to the company for harassing you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would also tell his coworkers what is going on.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I could do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would also tell his family and friends what is going on.<br>

"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm not doing very good. I lost my job about 4 months ago and I'm looking for some assistance.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry. I can understand how you are feeling.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it's been really hard. I've been looking for a job but it's been really hard.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how hard this is for you. Have you tried reaching out to a career counselor or recruiter? They can help you find a job that fulfills your needs.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have but it's been hard to find someone who is good at their job and can help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that, I also struggle to find someone who can help me at my job. I have found that helping others has helped me in finding a more fulfilling life.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's a good idea. I could try reaching out to people at my job.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Yes, that is a great idea. I am sure they would love to have you back!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so! I'll try reaching out to them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a great idea. I am sure they would love to have you back!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so! Thank you for the help.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day!<br>

"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, hi there.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, so you were just recently diagnosed with covid? I'm sorry to hear that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, just last week.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand why you would feel sad about that. Do you have any hobbies to take your mind off of it?<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend broke up with me about several months ago. And he didn't even say goodbye face to face. I just don't know why..<br>

<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that would be a good idea. You don't want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I just miss being in a relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that. It can be hard to find a new job when you lose your current one.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I didn't think about that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that you must feel betrayed as well since the person you thought was your true love is seeing other people.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I do. He told me he didn't want a relationship but I thought we were doing well and we have a lot in common.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would help to talk to him about how you are feeling.<br>
