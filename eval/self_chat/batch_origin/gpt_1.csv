"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello! How are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... I'm feeling a lot of stress on my study recently. I'm afraid that I'm gonna fail in the exams.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that you are stressed. What are you studying for?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm studying for my CPA exam.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how you are feeling. I was in your position not too long ago. I was studying for my CPA exam as well. I know you are doing your best at this time.. What are some things that you do to relax?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I usually just watch netflix. But lately, I've been studying before I watch netflix. And that's a bad habit. I'm afraid that if I fail my exams, I'll just continue to watch netflix and not study.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think if you keep practicing mindfulness, you will be able to notice when you are getting anxious and be able to take care of it and reassure yourself that you can pass the exam regardless of what happens tonight.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I guess I don't really have anything to lose at this point.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You can do it! You will feel much better about it once you get the exam over with and can focus on other things in your life. I know it's hard, but I know you can get through it!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm going to try and get some studying in tonight. If I fail, I'll just take it again next week. I have two more weeks to get this done.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a great idea, I think that will help you feel more prepared.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think so too. I'm usually really good about that, but I've been really busy lately.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand being busy with school and work, I'm in the same boat. But I know if I don't get this done now, I will have even more trouble when it's time to take the exam.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Exactly. And I've got two weeks to get some studying in. I should be fine.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you will be fine, just make sure to keep studying. I know you can do it!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks! I'm really hoping you're right!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you will do great!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You too!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... It's something about one of my long time friends. Well, she asked me to hang out and I refused her because of the pandemic. So, she now thinks I'm a selfish person and blocked me away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you are feeling about that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't understand why she thinks I'm being selfish. I offered to hang out, but she didn't want me to. So, she thinks I should just deal with it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think she is being selfish and insecure and is projecting it onto you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think you're right. She sounds a lot like my ex-husband!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you should set up some boundaries and tell her that you do not want to be friends with her anymore. If she wants to talk to you, she will reach out. I think you should be strong and stand up for yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I'll do that! Thanks for the advice.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are welcome. I hope it all works out for you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome. Have a great day.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You too!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm not doing very good. I lost my job about 4 months ago and I'm looking for some assistance.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It's been really hard. I've been looking for a job, but I can't find one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can imagine! When the pandemic started, it was really hard for me to find a job too. I was looking for almost a year. I can tell you that your motivation will come back once you find a job, but right now, you don't have to be in a rush.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm not in a huge rush. I'm just really worried about how I'm going to pay my bills.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest trying to work part time or even take some online classes in the meantime to help pay the bills. It's definitely easier to work online than it is to find work in the store.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I hadn't thought of that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure once you get into the swing of things again, everything will be okay.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm sure it will. I'm just really worried right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I completely understand why you would be worried, especially with the holidays coming up.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm really hoping that I can find some part time work somewhere to help out.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know there are a lot of places hiring right now because of the holidays, so I wouldn't be too worried about that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I'm going to keep looking.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it's great that you're looking for a job in the first place, a lot of people are too anxious or depressed to look for jobs right now.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I can understand that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope you're able to find a good job soon, this pandemic has been really hard on so many people.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it has been.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried reaching out to anyone in your network to look for a new position? It helped me when I was previously looking for a new job.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have, but it has been difficult.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know it's really hard right now, but I know you can find a new job!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, hi there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hello, how are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. And I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh wow, that is really tough. Especially being away from your family. Especially being in quarantine away from your family..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, it's really hard. I am not sure what to do with myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest doing some hobbies you enjoy to take your mind off of things. Maybe play a video game you enjoy or go on a walk.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have been trying to do that, but my mind just keeps wandering.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand what you are going through. It can be very difficult to do nothing but wait. What would you like to do in your spare time?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I would like to read, but I can't do that without getting exposure.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand. Do you have friends who would be willing to expose you to things that would help you? What about getting a book on tape? You could listen to it while you walk or do exercise.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I could try that. I have a friend who reads.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that would be a great start and you could see how you feel after that. Is there anything else that you've been struggling with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that will help, I feel a little better. I can't think of anything else.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad you're feeling a little better. Is there anything else I can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No. You have been most helpful.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm glad I could be helpful.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You were. Have a good day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You as well!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hi, how are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope I could help you. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend broke up with me about several months ago. And he didn't even say goodbye face to face. I just don't know why..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh,, I'm so sorry to hear that. That sounds really difficult. Do you have friends to talk to?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I do. I have a few friends who have been very supportive. It's just hard not having him around anymore.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand that. It might be good to talk to him about your feelings, too. It helps to get things off your chest, even if it is with friends.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I will do that. It would help. I just don't know what to say..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure he'd love to hear how you're feeling. Even if it is just to say that you are there for him, even if he doesn't say anything back.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I'm going to do that. I feel a lot better. I can't believe how much this helped.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so glad to hear that. I wish you the best and many blessings.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. You've been really helpful.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so glad I was able to help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You did. I'm going to go now and talk to him.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so happy to hear that. I wish you both the best.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you. I hope we can both move on from this.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sure you can.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope you have a great day.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You too."
