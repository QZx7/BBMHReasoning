seeker: Oh, hi there.
supporter: Hello, how are you doing?

supporter: Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that! This pandemic has caused so much stress in so many people, it's crazy!
seeker: Yes, it has. And my husband was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We are in the middle of moving, and it is a huge pain.
supporter: Oh wow, I am so sorry to hear that! I know that you must be feeling very anxious and sad at the moment..
seeker: Yes, I am. I just want it to be over.
supporter: I know, it's such a terrible time to be going through anything but I know you can make it through this!.
seeker: Thank you. I am trying. I really am.
supporter: I know you can!.
seeker: Thank you.
supporter: You're welcome!
seeker: Have you been through anything like this before?
supporter: I have had times when I was really motivated to change my life and make progress with my studies, but it was hard?
seeker: It has been hard. I have been trying to make progress with my studies but I have been struggling.
supporter: I can understand how that feels. I am currently in school as well and am also struggling with financial issues. It is very difficult to pay for school and living expenses while trying to study and work.
seeker: I am sorry to hear that. It is very hard. I am trying to work as well but it is hard.
supporter: It is very hard. But you are making progress and that is important. Have you looked into financial aid?
seeker: I am currently receiving financial aid but it is not enough. I am on a scholarship but it is not much. I am trying to work as well but it is hard.
supporter: I understand that. I was in a similar situation when I was in school. I know it can be very stressful. Have you talked to your advisor about options?
seeker: I have talked to my advisor and they have given me some options but it is still a lot of money. I am not sure what to do.
supporter: I know that you mentioned that you are on a budget, but do you have any money left over after paying your bills?
seeker: I have some but I am trying to save as much as I can. The house is almost paid off but my car is still a few years away. I want to make sure I can pay it off.
supporter: I understand. It is important to make sure that you are able to pay your bills. Are there any other sources of income that you could use to help pay the bills?
seeker: I have been working a part time job but it is not a lot. I think I am going to try to get a second job.
supporter: That sounds like a great idea. It will give you more time to spend with your family while still being able to provide for them.
seeker: I agree. I also feel like I have more time to spend with my kids. I feel like my husband is so busy all the time.
supporter: I am glad you guys have thought of that. I know how hard it can be to find time to spend with your family.
seeker: Yes, it can be hard. I feel like I don't have enough time to do everything I want to do.
supporter: I know that I have had to make some changes in my lifestyle to make it work, but it is definitely worth it in the long run.
seeker: What changes did you make?
supporter: I made sure that I was home when my kids were, and I made sure that I spent time with them instead of going out with friends.
seeker: That sounds like a good plan.
supporter: I know it is hard, but it is worth it to make time for things that you enjoy. It makes the days that you do get to spend with your kids that much better.
seeker: I think that will help them develop a healthy relationship with their parents.
supporter: It definitely will. Just try to be patient with them and make sure that they know that you love them.
