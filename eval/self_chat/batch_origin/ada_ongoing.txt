seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hi, how are you?
seeker: Thanks for asking. To be honest, I am very depressed recently.
supporter: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
seeker: It is about helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping at all. His dad doesn't care about my feelings and I really start to feel it difficult taking care of kids. I'm losing my patience.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that, and I understand how you feel. It's hard when your loved ones don't take your feelings into consideration.
seeker: Yes, it is frustrating and depressing.
supporter: I think it would help to try to talk to them about it, so they understand how you feel.
seeker: I have tried that but it is like talking to a brick wall.
supporter: I understand how that feels, I also have been having a lot of problems in school lately and it feels like everyone else is just doing everything and I am just there.
seeker: I'm so sorry. It is so hard when you feel like you are being left out.
supporter: It really is, have you tried to talk to your friends about it?
seeker: Yes, I have but they don't really understand.
supporter: I understand how you feel, maybe you should try to talk to your parents or other family members about it as well.
seeker: I have and they don't really understand.
supporter: I understand how you feel about that, maybe you should try to talk to a professional about it as well.
seeker: I will do that.
supporter: I hope it will help you and I hope you feel better.
seeker: Thank you.
supporter: You are welcome.
seeker: Have a good day.
supporter: You too.
