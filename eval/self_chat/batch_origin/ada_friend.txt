seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hey! How can I help?
seeker: Yeah... It's something about one of my long time friends. Well, she asked me to hang out and I refused her because of the pandemic. So, she now thinks I'm a selfish person and blocked me away.
supporter: Oh no! That does not sound good.
seeker: Yeah. I tried to explain to her that I wasn't doing it out of spite, but she didn't seem to get it.
supporter: I think you are right. Sometimes people just don't get it. Maybe you should just do your job and do it well, and let her know that you did your best and it wasn't good enough. Do you think that might work?
seeker: I think I'm going to try that. I really don't want this to be a big deal. We've been friends for so long.
supporter: I think that might be the best thing to do. I hope it works out for you!
seeker: Thank you!
