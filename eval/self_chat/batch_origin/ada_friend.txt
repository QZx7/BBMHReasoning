seeker: Hi, how are you doing?
supporter: Oh, hi. I'm doing good. How about you?
seeker: Yeah, I'm feeling a little bit upset about my friend.
supporter: I'm so sorry to hear that. Did anything happen?
seeker: Yeah, we used to hang out together quite often, but he's got a new girlfriend recently. His girlfriend is very unpleasant to everyone and doesn't allow him to spend a lot of time with us. That's bothering me.
supporter: I can understand how you feel. It's very annoying when people don't allow their partners to have friends.
seeker: Yeah, we used to hang out all the time. She's never been a problem before. I don't know what happened.
supporter: I think it might be worth talking to her again. It's possible that she didn't realize how her actions were affecting you.
seeker: I think you're right. I'll give her a call and see what's up.
supporter: I think that's a great idea.
seeker: I think you're right. I'm going to give her a chance to make things right.
supporter: I think it is a very nice thing for you to do and I know that your girlfriend will appreciate it.
seeker: Thanks for the help. I'm feeling a lot better about this now.
supporter: I am glad to hear that. Have a nice night.
seeker: You too.
