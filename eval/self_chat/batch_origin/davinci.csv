"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Doing good. How are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, I'm feeling really anxious recently.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, could you tell me more details?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: The online course is too difficult for me. Our school started online course because of the Covid. But just can't focus on study when I'm doing the online course.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. I was also very anxious when I first started taking the online course. However, once I got used to it, it was very helpful in learning.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've tried to get used to it, but it's just not working out for me. I've tried taking breaks, but I can't focus for long.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have found that different people learn in different ways. I am very organized and like to have everything in one place. You might be better off taking notes in a book. Is that something you can do?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's a good idea. I usually take notes while I'm reading the book, but it's not very efficient.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think taking notes in a book is a great idea! I use a notebook and a pen to write everything down. This way I can reference it anytime I need to.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's a good idea too. I think I'll try that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope it helps!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It should. I'm feeling a lot more confident about this.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's great!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You too!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hi. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm doing ok, just a bit sad.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I feel bad to hear that, could you please share more details?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it's about my friend. She wanted to hang out with me and I refused her because of the pandemic. And she felt that I was selfish and didn't want to spend time with her. It's really bothering me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you are feeling about that, I would be upset as well.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't understand why she thinks I'm being selfish. I'm not going to hang out with her but I'm also not going to hurt my friendship with her just to be safe.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think she is being selfish herself by not accepting your decision and by putting you in a bad light.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I agree. I think she's trying to make me feel guilty for not wanting to hang out with her in a bad light.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it might be time to make a choice as to if she is a true friend or not.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think so too. I'm not going to hang out with her just to be nice. I have my own friends that I can hang out with.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a great idea.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks! I feel a lot better about this.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are very welcome. I am glad you feel better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, you've been very helpful. Have a great day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You as well!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hello. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm not feeling weel.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I feel bad to hear that. What is the matter?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I lost my job recently and didn't have luck finding a new one. That's really making me stressful. I don't know what to do...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. I can understand how stressful that would be.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I just don't know what to do.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried looking for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things? Or could you try working from home a few days a week?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've tried the working from home thing. It's not really for me. I feel like I need to be in the office to be productive.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that. Have you tried reaching out to your friends or family for some support?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've talked to my friends a little bit. They are also unhelpful. They think I should just get a job.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that it is hard right now finding a job with this pandemic going on and it will take time but i know you will find a job soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I know, it's just frustrating. I wish I could just be in the office doing work.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried looking online for jobs?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have, but the problem is that I'm also trying to be productive and go to school at the same time. It's really hard to find a balance.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that completely, I am also looking for a job and am also in school..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I wish you the best of luck in finding a job! I know that it's really hard out there right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Thank you! I know it is hard right now, but we will get through it..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I sure hope so! I'm trying to stay positive and keep trying.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know you will find something soon!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you! I really appreciate it!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! I hope you feel better soon and are able to relax.."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for asking. To be honest, I am very depressed recently.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It is about helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping at all. His dad doesn't care about my feelings and I really start to feel it difficult taking care of kids. I'm losing my patience.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can understand how you feel. It sounds like you're being treated very poorly, and it's making you feel depressed. Is that right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, it is.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I can tell how anxious and upset that is making you feel. I know how it feels to be anxious and upset, too.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you. I'm just so tired.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would help to talk to your son about the situation and let him know how you feel.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have tried that, but he doesn't seem to care.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sorry to hear that, have you tried other people or a group of people who have been through the same thing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, I haven't yet.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am sure that if you were to find a group of people who had been through the same thing, they could help you through your depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think you're right.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would help a lot!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I will do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so glad I was able to chat with you today!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Me too! It really helped."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, I think I could find some help from you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hi there. Sure, I'm glad to be able to provide some assistance. Did anything happen?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things are you experiencing now?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed sometimg to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am so sorry to hear that this has been going on. How does your family and friends feel about it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: They don't know. I haven't told them yet. I don't know how to bring it up.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it is important that you tell them. They will be your biggest support system and will be able to help you through this.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think you're right. I'm just not sure how to bring it up.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should bring it up by telling them that you suspect that your marriage is in trouble. This way, they will be more supportive than if you had not told them.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I'm just worried that they'll be disappointed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think they will be more disappointed if you do not bring it up.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I agree. I just don't know how to bring it up.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think you should just tell them that you have some things you need to talk to them about and you would like to talk to them about your relationship with them.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I can do that. I'm just worried that they'll think I'm being dramatic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that they will all understand how hard this situation has been for you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope that everything works out for you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day!<br>
