seeker: Hi there.
supporter: Oh, hello. How are you doing?
seeker: I'm not feeling weel.
supporter: Oh, I feel bad to hear that. What is the matter?
seeker: I lost my job recently and didn't have luck finding a new one. That's really making me stressful. I don't know what to do...
supporter: I am so sorry to hear that. I can understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you have been working hard to get back on your feet.
seeker: I've been looking for a job for months and I just can't find one. I don't know what to do.
supporter: Have you tried looking online? I know that I have found many jobs online.
seeker: I have, but I'm not sure what to do to make myself look good on the application.
supporter: I would suggest putting on your resume that you have been looking for a job for a while and that this is how you found it.
seeker: That's a good idea. But, I feel like I should have more experience than I do.
supporter: I know that there are a lot of jobs out there but you have to be persistent and put in applications everywhere.
seeker: That's true. I guess I need to keep trying. Do you have any suggestions on how to be more persistent?
supporter: Have you tried reaching out to hiring agencies for help with a resume and/or a job interview?
seeker: I have tried reaching out for help. I think I need to try again. What should I say to them?
supporter: I would suggest what you said in your post:  "I've been applying for jobs for almost a year now and I haven't gotten a single call back. I feel like I'm going crazy."  And tell them the details of what is going on.  They will probably want to know about any work experience you have, how long you've been looking, and if you have any connections that might help.  Also, if you have a family, they might want to know if you are being treated unfairly or if there is something wrong with the job market in your area.
seeker: I feel like I'm going crazy!
supporter: I think that it is a perfectly normal reaction to have to feeling lost in a new situation.  And it sounds like your family is supportive, so if you have a problem, they should be there to help you through it.
seeker: I just feel so discouraged.  I'm going to keep trying.  I just have to keep my head up.
supporter: I think that is a good approach.  I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same situation.
seeker: I think you're right.  My friends seem to be having a much easier time than I am.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I think I'm just too hard on myself.
supporter: I have been in a similar situation and I know how hard it is to watch your friends get a chance that you don't get.  I think that you should be hard on yourself if you haven't been able to get a job in this economy.
seeker: I know, it's so hard to watch.  And then to feel so helpless to change anything.
supporter: I know that I'm not the only one who is feeling this way.  I think that a lot of people are in a similar situation and that is why there are so many job centers around.
seeker: I'm going to try and keep my head up and keep applying.  I'll keep my fingers crossed!
supporter: I know it is difficult, but I know you will find something soon.
seeker: Thanks for the encouragement!
supporter: You're welcome! I know you will find something soon.
seeker: Thanks!  Have a great day!
supporter: You too!
