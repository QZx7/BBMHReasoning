"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>

"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... It's something about one of my long time friends. Well, she asked me to hang out and I refused her because of the pandemic. So, she now thinks I'm a selfish person and blocked me away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope you can get through to her.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I tried to, but it's not working. I think she's too far gone.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's unfortunate. I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Do you have any other friends you can hang out with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have other friends, but they're all busy with other things. I don't want to burden them with my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's a good way to look at it. You have to take care of yourself before you can help others.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I try to. I eat right, I exercise, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough for them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know what you mean. It's hard when you feel like you're not good enough for others.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It is. And it's hard to not feel like you're letting them down.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know how you feel. Do you have any hobbies you can do to take your mind off things?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I like to read.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I love to read as well. What kind of books do you like? I like mysteries.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I like mysteries, too. I also like fiction.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you ever read any Stephen King books? He's my favorite author. I've read all of his books.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I haven't, but I've heard good things.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You should check him out. He was born in 1947, so he's been around a long time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will! I'm always looking for new authors to read.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You should also check out J.K. Rowling. She wrote the Harry Potter series.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've read the Harry Potter series, too. I love them!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Do you have a favorite character? Mine is Hermione. She's the smartest character in the series.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I love all of them, but I think I have a soft spot for Hermione too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: She's definitely a favorite of mine as well. What's your favorite book? I like Goblet of Fire.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think it's the Order of the Phoenix. I love the whole story of Voldemort's rise to power.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I love that one too! It's so interesting to see how the Death Eaters came to be."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: Me too. I've been looking on the internet for a job every day, but so far no luck.<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: Anything really. I've never done anything like this before. I'm not sure what to do.<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: I agree. I think it would be really interesting to learn about their culture.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think so too. Do you have any hobbies that you like to do in your spare time?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I like to read. I also like to play video games.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Video games are a lot of fun. What's your favorite genre of video game?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I like action and adventure games. What about you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm a big fan of RPGs. I like being able to create my own character and explore the world.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool. I like to create characters too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's awesome! What kind of characters do you create? I like creating elves and dragons.<br>

<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds like a lot of fun. Have you ever created a character from the Harry Potter series?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: No, I haven't.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That's too bad. I think it would be fun to create a character based on Hermione Granger.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that would be fun too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You should try it sometime. It would be really fun to see what you come up with.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I will.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You should let me know how it goes. I'd like to see how your character turns out.<br>

"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, hi there.<br>

<strong>seeker</strong>: I am a stay at home mom.<br>
