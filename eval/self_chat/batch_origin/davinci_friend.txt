seeker: Hi.
supporter: Oh, hi. How are you doing?
seeker: I'm doing ok, just a bit sad.
supporter: I feel bad to hear that, could you please share more details?
seeker: Yeah, it's about my friend. She wanted to hang out with me and I refused her because of the pandemic. And she felt that I was selfish and didn't want to spend time with her. It's really bothering me.
supporter: I understand how you are feeling about that, I would be upset as well.
seeker: I don't understand why she thinks I'm being selfish. I'm not going to hang out with her but I'm also not going to hurt my friendship with her just to be safe.
supporter: I think she is being selfish herself by not accepting your decision and by putting you in a bad light.
seeker: I agree. I think she's trying to make me feel guilty for not wanting to hang out with her in a bad light.
supporter: I think it might be time to make a choice as to if she is a true friend or not.
seeker: I think so too. I'm not going to hang out with her just to be nice. I have my own friends that I can hang out with.
supporter: I think that is a great idea.
seeker: Thanks! I feel a lot better about this.
supporter: You are very welcome. I am glad you feel better. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
seeker: No, you've been very helpful. Have a great day!
supporter: You as well!
