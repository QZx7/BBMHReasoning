"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: hello.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am unable to focus on my studies due to stress. I am afraid that I am gonna fail.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: so you mean you are afraid you will fail because you are stressed out with your studies.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: yes, due to stress and anxiety it is hard to concentrate.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: that can be hard but you can do it. knowing that you are scared is enough motivation for you to push through.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't sleep at night and having bad dreams that I will fail in my exams or I am unable to answer questions.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i can sense your feeling, i once had same mind stress before.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So what you did? how you came out of it?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: i stop reading alone. I read with my friends. girlfriend or read in a public place like the library.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That is a great idea but due to COVID it could be risky to meet up daily and library is closed where I live.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: yes, covid has made things messy but you can always connect with someone online and chat about what you have read so far. I did same thing during the lockdown.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what I can do. Thanks! It might make me feel better. What else can I do to control my anxiety?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: always make sure you get enough rest and when ever you are getting the feeling next time, distract your self with something you love and then continue after a while.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much for all your suggestion. Hope it will help me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: and make sure you eat well. and exercise to control your breathing.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Is there any specific exercise?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you can do bit of yoga and meditating. You should be fine with that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you so much. I am feeling motivated now . I will try to start it tomorrow onwards.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: good is there any other thing i can help you with?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's enough to start with. Hope it will work out. Thanks for all your help. byee.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: you are very welcome and good luck with your studies.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, how are you?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Doing good. How are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh, I'm feeling really anxious recently.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, could you tell me more details?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: The online course is too difficult for me. Our school started online course because of the Covid. But just can't focus on study when I'm doing the online course.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel. It is very difficult to study online. It is often times harder than in person.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, it is. I just don't know what to do to help myself focus.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you thought about taking breaks and taking a walk or reading a book to help you focus?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I try that, but my classes are all online, so I don't really have a way to meet with my friends to take breaks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that. Have you thought about talking to your professors about the situation? They are usually understanding when it comes to academic situations.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have, but they're all on break right now, too. They said they're also trying to figure out how to deal with it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that they will have more helpful tips than we can give you. They have been in the same situation you are in, and they probably want to help you too.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I guess I'm just worried that I won't find a way to cope with the stress and I'll end up failing or something.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that if you take your time and study as much as you can, you will be fine.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I'm also really worried about my grades during the pandemic. I'm worried that I'll be too stressed to study and I'll end up failing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that if you study hard and be consistent, you will do just fine.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I guess I'm just worried that I'll make a mistake and forget to study for a day or two.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think if you study hard for a few days, you will be able to remember everything.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I guess I'll have to just put my mind to it and really try.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that will help you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think so too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope you feel better soon and can find some peace in your situation.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: you too."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hey! How can I help?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: So I had a long time friend who recently blocked me from everything. The reason was I refused to hang out with her during covid and she questioned our friendship. Something she said was \""It's selfish of me to work rather than spend time with a special friend.\"" So I got upset and called her out. And in response she blocked me. And I'm more upset at myself because I wanted to tell her more about how horrible of a human being she is in general. But I cannot because she blocked me on everything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Have you explained to her that you NEED to work, and don't be upset with yourself because you did the right thing. If your friendship was strong she will surely unblock you. Give her time to cool down.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah I did. And she just got more upset and said I was selfish. Like she's the type who would not back down. and she's lost many friends and romanics partners that way. So I feel like she's not going to unblock me and get back together. I'm just really upset because I want to call her off, not because I lost a friendship. Because screw her : ) I put up with her too much.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are not the one who is selfish here as you have done the right thing, and she will hopefully see that.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Should I go to her house and personally tell her how I feel?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: If she doesn't then you know she wasn't worth your time in the first place. And no because this will make her more angry. If she is aware of how you feel, she will come back in due time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I guess I'm the type of person who has to tell people how I feel, otherwise I won't find peace. Do you have any other suggestions how I can get passed this?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: But for now, you should find other ways to make peace with yourself, for example, hanging out with other friends and that may take your mind of it. and if that isn't an option simply keeping yourself busy may help.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: But I can't really hang out with anyone because of COVID. That's how this whole situation started : )<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Maybe spend more time with work, or keeping yourself occupied with other things. And she will come back if she really cared about your relationship in the first place.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, work can keep my mind off all this.. And that's true. Thank you for listening to my ranting..<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Your welcome, there is always someone out there for you :)<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Aw thank you! You have a good one.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hi. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, I'm feeling a bit upset about my friends.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm so sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more details about that?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah... Several friends of mine had a trip together without letting me know. They created a secret group discussing the details without me. And when I ask them about that, they just said that they forgot to let me know .. That's really bothering me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: That sounds really really bad. Do you think that maybe they have been cheating on you?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't think so... But I can't be sure.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am really sorry for what is happening and I really hope that you can get through this.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know... I can't really see any other reason why they would have wanted to keep that secret. But I don't know if I can get through this. It's really hurting me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should try to talk to them and see why they kept this secret. If they really care about you, they will apologize and try to make things right.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I can't really see a way to start the conversation... It's been so long and I don't know where to start.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should try to talk to them in a calm way and let them know that you are concerned. If they deny it, maybe you should get a lawyer.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think that's a good idea. I can do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that they will understand. It's not their fault. It's something that you can't control.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm just really worried about how I'm going to get through to them.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that you should be kind to them. Tell them that they made you feel uncomfortable and that you would like them to be more careful in the future.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try that. I hope it will work.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope so too. Friends are supposed to support each other.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I agree. I feel a lot better."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hello, how are you doing today?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was looking for some assistance. I lost my job 4 month ago.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Losing your job is one of the biggest stressors in life, how have you been handling it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Well first few month was kind off alright, Was looking for a job in different places without success. And now I am really depressed and I feel so useless.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know what it's like to lose a job, and when it's hard to find a new one it can really make you feel low. What activities have you been doing in addition to seeking new employment?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Nice that you understand me, I was trying job websites alongside with jobcenter in town centre. I have job seeker allowance but it will not cover the rent.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am living in a high-rent city and the only way I was able to keep my apartment was to find a roommate. Are there ways you can get help from friends or family until a new job opens up?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I am renting just a room at the moment, Before I had a girlfriend so we had to split the bill. After she left I had to take all responsibility just on myself to pay bills. I have few friends but don't think they could lend me a lot of money anyway.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: One possible solution, if it's possible for you, could be to sub-lease your room to someone else and stay with friends or family. Even if they can't loan you money, they may be able to let you stay with them for a week while you make money renting your room as an airbnb.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Oh AirBnB might be a solution actually. I will speak to my cousin if I could stay couple of nights at his place.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: What sort of employment are you looking for? Perhaps we can brainstorm some places you can go to make connections for potential work.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was working in IKEA warehouse before I got redundant.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Working in a warehouse shows you have great skills for several other types of jobs. Have you checked small independent-contractor sites like TaskRabbit or Lyft to make extra funds while you search for a new permanent job?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I even haven't heard about those. I am really useless sometimes... What kind of jobs I can find there do you know?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Well, if you didn't know about them, that's not your fault. It's possible that you could find a new job opportunity while working on smaller tasks or by volunteering for a local organization. You could meet new folks who could provide you with new connections for employment!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I Will definitely try that. You are really helpful. Have you been doing any jobs through those websites?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Yes I am able to make a little spending money by doing small tasks like delivering real estate papers, or delivery take-out food. You can google a list of sites like RentSons.com where you can sign up to do an assortment of tasks, and your warehouse skills will come in handy!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's cool, I feel now a lot better. Maybe I will be able to find even a girlfriend somewhere on those jobs. I feel lonely after my girlfriend left me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We all feel lonely when life gets hard, but getting yourself out there to do tasks will help you feel useful AND you could meet your future wife, you never know! I wish you the absolute best!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you very much for you help. I learned something new today and feel much better.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You're welcome. I think you'll do great.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a lovely afternoon!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You too!<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi there.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hello. How are you doing?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm not feeling weel.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I feel bad to hear that. What is the matter?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I lost my job recently and didn't have luck finding a new one. That's really making me stressful. I don't know what to do...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am so sorry to hear that. I can understand how frustrating that can be, especially when you have been working hard to get back on your feet.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I've been looking for a job for months and I just can't find one. I don't know what to do.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried looking online? I know that I have found many jobs online.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have, but I'm not sure what to do to make myself look good on the application.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest putting on your resume that you have been looking for a job for a while and that this is how you found it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's a good idea. But, I feel like I should have more experience than I do.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that there are a lot of jobs out there but you have to be persistent and put in applications everywhere.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's true. I guess I need to keep trying. Do you have any suggestions on how to be more persistent?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Have you tried reaching out to hiring agencies for help with a resume and/or a job interview?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have tried reaching out for help. I think I need to try again. What should I say to them?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I would suggest what you said in your post:  ""I've been applying for jobs for almost a year now and I haven't gotten a single call back. I feel like I'm going crazy.""  And tell them the details of what is going on.  They will probably want to know about any work experience you have, how long you've been looking, and if you have any connections that might help.  Also, if you have a family, they might want to know if you are being treated unfairly or if there is something wrong with the job market in your area.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel like I'm going crazy!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that it is a perfectly normal reaction to have to feeling lost in a new situation.  And it sounds like your family is supportive, so if you have a problem, they should be there to help you through it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I just feel so discouraged.  I'm going to keep trying.  I just have to keep my head up.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a good approach.  I think you will find that a lot of your friends are in the same situation.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think you're right.  My friends seem to be having a much easier time than I am.  I don't know what I'm doing wrong.  I think I'm just too hard on myself.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I have been in a similar situation and I know how hard it is to watch your friends get a chance that you don't get.  I think that you should be hard on yourself if you haven't been able to get a job in this economy.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I know, it's so hard to watch.  And then to feel so helpless to change anything.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know that I'm not the only one who is feeling this way.  I think that a lot of people are in a similar situation and that is why there are so many job centers around.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm going to try and keep my head up and keep applying.  I'll keep my fingers crossed!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know it is difficult, but I know you will find something soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You're welcome! I know you will find something soon.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks!  Have a great day!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You too!"
"<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello, I am feeling very sad because I tested positive for Covid this week. I am in quarantine away from my family.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: sorry to hear about that. So your test results were positive. Did I get it right?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I tested positive for the Covid virus on Wednesday.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: It must be hard to stay alone. Are you having fever or any other sever symptoms. Hope there is someone to take care of you for a while at least.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm by myself in my house. My wife took the kids to stay with her father until my quarantine period is over. I have mainly cold symptoms - body aches, stuffy head, sore throat.  Nothing too serious so far.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I had COVID last month with mild symptoms. Good to know that you don't have any sever symptoms. You will recover fast.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so. I'm on the older side (not senior citizen yet) with high blood pressure, so I'm a little nervous about how it will affect me.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I can understand staying alone will be devastating.  Keep monitoring your oxygen level. If  that is normal, you don't have to worry. You can read watch tv or can do video calling to your family.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the advice.  We're doing a lot of video calls so I can see everyone.  That helps.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I wish for your fast recovery. Hope this COVID situation end soon somehow..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That's what is so frustrating - I feel like a couple more months or so and I'd have the vaccine.  Made it a year, then get infected during the stretch run of this pandemic.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Very true! It is kind of never ending. There should be some permanent solution for it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't know if that will ever happen, but if it becomes rare and much less deadly like colds and flu, we should be able to return to a pre-covid life or close to it.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: We can still hope for the best right now. Let's stay positive and fight it.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I was fighting it, but Covid won this week!<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Think other way. You defeat it and you won.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I hope so.  I'm only in like the third inning or so right now though.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: You are a strong person. You are almost there to win. Your family is always there with you.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for the encouragement.  10 days cannot come fast enough.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I know but i week has gone so rest will go too. Wishing you fast recovery and take care of yourself.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks, good luck to you. Nice chatting with you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thank you! It was nice talking to you too..<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hello.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Hi, how are you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thanks for asking. To be honest, I am very depressed recently.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It is about helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping at all. His dad doesn't care about my feelings and I really start to feel it difficult taking care of kids. I'm losing my patience.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that, and I understand how you feel. It's hard when your loved ones don't take your feelings into consideration.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, it is frustrating and depressing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would help to try to talk to them about it, so they understand how you feel.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have tried that but it is like talking to a brick wall.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how that feels, I also have been having a lot of problems in school lately and it feels like everyone else is just doing everything and I am just there.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I'm so sorry. It is so hard when you feel like you are being left out.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: It really is, have you tried to talk to your friends about it?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yes, I have but they don't really understand.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel, maybe you should try to talk to your parents or other family members about it as well.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I have and they don't really understand.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand how you feel about that, maybe you should try to talk to a professional about it as well.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will do that.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I hope it will help you and I hope you feel better.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Thank you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You are welcome.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Have a good day.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: You too."
"<strong>seeker</strong>: I feel emotionally sad. It is unforgiving and hoping to find healing.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Hi! Hope you are feeling better now. I will help you to find some solution. Why are you feeling emotionally sad?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: With this kind of pandemic situation, it is making me more upset as I am not able to go out to socialize with people to foget my problems.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: The pandemic situation is tough for everyone, so don't worry.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: My boyfriend brokeup with me 6 months ago and without saying good bye face to face.....it is just making me wonder why?<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I am sorry to hear that..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We were not able to see each other ever since the pandemic and we just ended our relationship.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: I would like to give some suggestions.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: that would be great.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please ask your boyfriend to discuss to me so that i can advice him.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: We don't talk anymore. I could not reach him and i do not want to talk to him too.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: This pandemic is taking longer time to settle because many people do not follow the guidelines suggested.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: definately...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please do not get upset.  Try to understand each other then only it is possible to reconcile. Please cooperate with each other so you can be back together.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I don't want to see him or talk to him. I just want to get on with my life to start a brand new one. I am just feeling so sad and depressed.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Is my advice helpful to you?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: no.  are not telling me how i can get my depression away.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Don't be upset we all come across difficult times in life. This is one of the time.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thank you. i will forget and take it one at a time.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Please seek some interesting relaxation for mind. If you deviate your mind from getting upset then you can overcome this depression.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I will try....<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Ok sure . Good luck..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: thanks.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: lime"">supporter 1</strong>: Thanks for listening to my suggestions.<br>","<strong>seeker</strong>: Hi, I think I could find some help from you.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: Oh, hi there. Sure, I'm glad to be able to provide some assistance. Did anything happen?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things are you experiencing now?<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed sometimg to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I am so sorry that you were treated so badly. You deserve so much better than that!.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I know, right? It's hard to let go of all the good times we had together, though. We've been together for 5 years. I don't know how to break it to him...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would be good for you to have a conversation with him about how you feel and ask him why he has been treating you so badly. I hope that I have been able to help a little!.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: You have! I'm just not sure how to start the conversation...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think it would be good to be honest and say ""I am feeling a little bit like you are ignoring me, and I don't like that."" and then maybe give him some time to think about what he has done that could be making you feel that way?.<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: That sounds like a good plan. I just don't want it to blow up in my face. We are in a small town and if it gets bad enough, we will be known as the town who broke up over a boyfriend...<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I understand that. You could also tell a teacher or someone you trust about the situation. They will help you out. I know how hard this situation can be. I have been in a similar situation before..<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I think I will do that. I will tell my math teacher. I really don't want to have to deal with him anymore.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I think that is a great idea. They will be able to help you out. I know this is hard, but I know you can make it through this!<br>
<strong>seeker</strong>: I know I can too. I just have to keep my head up and think positively.<br>
<strong style=""background-color: aqua"">supporter 2</strong>: I know you will be able to make it through this!"
