seeker: Hi, I think I could find some help from you.
supporter: Sure, what can I do for you?
seeker: Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now.
supporter: Okay, what kind of decisions are you facing?
seeker: It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed something to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...
supporter: That definitely sounds like a difficult situation. It's understandable that you don't know what to do, but I think the best first step would be to talk to him about it. Find out why he lied and then decide if you can trust him or not. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide if you can continue the relationship or not.
seeker: I just don't know how to face him.
supporter: That's understandable. It can be hard to bring up difficult topics, but it's important to have a clear and honest conversation. You can tell him how you feel and why you're upset, and then listen to what he has to say. It might help to set a time and place to talk so that you both can be prepared.
seeker: I'm not sure about that...
supporter: That's okay. Take some time to think it over and come up with a plan. You don't have to rush into anything. It's important to take care of yourself and make sure that you're comfortable with whatever decision you make.
seeker: Thanks for the suggestions.
supporter: You're welcome. I hope it helps.
