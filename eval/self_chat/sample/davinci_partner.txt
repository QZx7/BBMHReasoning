seeker: Hi, I think I could find some help from you.
supporter: Oh, hi there. Sure, I'm glad to be able to provide some assistance. Did anything happen?
seeker: Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things are you experiencing now?
seeker: It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed sometimg to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...
supporter: I am so sorry to hear that this has been going on. How does your family and friends feel about it?
seeker: They don't know. I haven't told them yet. I don't know how to bring it up.
supporter: I think it is important that you tell them. They will be your biggest support system and will be able to help you through this.
seeker: I think you're right. I'm just not sure how to bring it up.
supporter: I think that you should bring it up by telling them that you suspect that your marriage is in trouble. This way, they will be more supportive than if you had not told them.
seeker: That's true. I'm just worried that they'll be disappointed.
supporter: I think they will be more disappointed if you do not bring it up.
seeker: I agree. I just don't know how to bring it up.
supporter: I think you should just tell them that you have some things you need to talk to them about and you would like to talk to them about your relationship with them.
seeker: I think I can do that. I'm just worried that they'll think I'm being dramatic.
supporter: I think that they will all understand how hard this situation has been for you.
seeker: I hope so.
supporter: I hope that everything works out for you.
seeker: Thank you.
supporter: You're welcome.
seeker: Have a good day!
supporter: You too.
