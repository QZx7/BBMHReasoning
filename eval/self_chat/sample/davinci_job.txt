supporter: I'm so sorry to hear that. I can understand how stressful that would be.
seeker: I just don't know what to do.
supporter: Have you tried looking for some side jobs like cleaning or organizing things? Or could you try working from home a few days a week?
seeker: I've tried the working from home thing. It's not really for me. I feel like I need to be in the office to be productive.
supporter: I understand that. Have you tried reaching out to your friends or family for some support?
seeker: I've talked to my friends a little bit. They are also unhelpful. They think I should just get a job.

seeker: I know, it's just frustrating. I wish I could just be in the office doing work.

seeker: I have, but the problem is that I'm also trying to be productive and go to school at the same time. It's really hard to find a balance.
supporter: I understand that completely, I am also looking for a job and am also in school..
seeker: I wish you the best of luck in finding a job! I know that it's really hard out there right now.
supporter: Thank you! I know it is hard right now, but we will get through it..
