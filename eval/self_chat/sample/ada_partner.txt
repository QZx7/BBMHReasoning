seeker: Hi, I think I could find some help from you.
supporter: Oh, hi there. Sure, I'm glad to be able to provide some assistance. Did anything happen?
seeker: Yeah, it's complicated, my life is all about making decisions right now.
supporter: I'm sorry to hear that. What sort of things are you experiencing now?
seeker: It's so difficult. Well, it's about my boyfriend. I found him lying about everything. When we met, he said that he was divorced, but I ended up finding out that he was still legally married. He said that he needed sometimg to make the process, but I really don't know if I could trust him or not. I don't know what to do now...
supporter: I am so sorry that you were treated so badly. You deserve so much better than that!.
seeker: I know, right? It's hard to let go of all the good times we had together, though. We've been together for 5 years. I don't know how to break it to him...
supporter: I think it would be good for you to have a conversation with him about how you feel and ask him why he has been treating you so badly. I hope that I have been able to help a little!.
seeker: You have! I'm just not sure how to start the conversation...
supporter: I think it would be good to be honest and say "I am feeling a little bit like you are ignoring me, and I don't like that." and then maybe give him some time to think about what he has done that could be making you feel that way?.
seeker: That sounds like a good plan. I just don't want it to blow up in my face. We are in a small town and if it gets bad enough, we will be known as the town who broke up over a boyfriend...
supporter: I understand that. You could also tell a teacher or someone you trust about the situation. They will help you out. I know how hard this situation can be. I have been in a similar situation before..
seeker: I think I will do that. I will tell my math teacher. I really don't want to have to deal with him anymore.
supporter: I think that is a great idea. They will be able to help you out. I know this is hard, but I know you can make it through this!
seeker: I know I can too. I just have to keep my head up and think positively.
supporter: I know you will be able to make it through this!
