seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hello! How are you doing today?
seeker: Yeah... I'm feeling a lot of stress on my study recently. I'm afraid that I'm gonna fail in the exams.
supporter: I'm so sorry to hear you are feeling stressful. Do you have anyone you can talk to about your study stress?
seeker: I do, but I'm afraid that they'll think I'm being too dramatic.
supporter: I'm sure they won't think you are being too dramatic. Students are very important to the economy and they deserve to be well-rested and healthy so they can do their best in their studies.
seeker: I guess you're right. But... I haven't been doing very well in my exams lately. I'm afraid that the rest of my class will judge me.
supporter: I'm sure you are worried about your grade, which is completely understandable, but remember that you have to do your best for you and not worry about what other people think.
seeker: I guess you're right. But, this is a pretty important grade for me.
supporter: I'm sure you will do your best and pass those exams with flying colors.
seeker: I hope so.
