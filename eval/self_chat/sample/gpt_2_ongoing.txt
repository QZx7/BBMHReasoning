seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hi, how are you?
seeker: Thanks for asking. To be honest, I am very depressed recently.
supporter: Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened?
seeker: It is about helping to raise my grandson and his dad is not helping at all. His dad doesn't care about my feelings and I really start to feel it difficult taking care of kids. I'm losing my patience.
supporter: I can understand how you feel. It's hard when one parent doesn't support the other. Have you tried to talk to your grandson about the situation?
seeker: I have tried to talk to him, but he doesn't seem to care at all. His dad is just so busy, he barely has time to talk to him.
supporter: I can understand why your son might feel that way. I know that I would feel upset if my grandson didn't support me.
seeker: I would too! But he has a dad who is always available. I'm not sure what I can do to make him care more.
supporter: Have you thought about seeing a therapist to talk about this? Does your son have any siblings that you are close to?
seeker: I have thought about a therapist, but I'm not sure how they would help. My son is an only child.
supporter: I think a therapist would be a great way to help you both. It could be a bonding experience for you and your son. Often times, people who have issues with anxiety and depression need help dealing with those issues.
seeker: I think I'll give it a try. Maybe it can help me feel more cared for.
supporter: I think that would be great,.
seeker: I agree, thank you for talking with me.
supporter: You are very welcome!
seeker: Have a good day!
supporter: you too.
