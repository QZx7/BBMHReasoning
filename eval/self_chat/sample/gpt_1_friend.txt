seeker: Hello.
supporter: Hey! How can I help?
seeker: Yeah... It's something about one of my long time friends. Well, she asked me to hang out and I refused her because of the pandemic. So, she now thinks I'm a selfish person and blocked me away.
supporter: I understand how you are feeling about that..
seeker: I don't understand why she thinks I'm being selfish. I offered to hang out, but she didn't want me to. So, she thinks I should just deal with it?
supporter: I think she is being selfish and insecure and is projecting it onto you.
seeker: I think you're right. She sounds a lot like my ex-husband!
supporter: I think you should set up some boundaries and tell her that you do not want to be friends with her anymore. If she wants to talk to you, she will reach out. I think you should be strong and stand up for yourself.
seeker: I think I'll do that! Thanks for the advice.
supporter: You are welcome. I hope it all works out for you.
seeker: Thanks!
supporter: You're welcome. Have a great day.
seeker: You too!
